Pros :
1. Great build quality on the 3.5mm jack and overall sound quality on the headphones is pretty good for the price!
2. Great treble and rock music playback is awesome.

Cons:
1. A metallic built headphone unit would have been better. The plastic makes it basic.

I use it mostly for logging to remote work machine. Can use it for light to medium level programming. Camera quality is fine for zoom calls. Speaker looses clarity at full volume. Battery gives around 2-2.5 hrs average backup when I used for video calls and its self discharging if laptop is not used for long. Keyboard and trackpad are the worst, always use a external mouse and keyboard combo. It has 2 USB 3.0, 1 hdmi, 1 USB type C, 3.5 mm ports. So need to judiciously use them or buy an external USB adapter. Overall good buy if you get a great deal on the price.",5

After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.
Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.
Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.
Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.

5973,Valuable for money,"As I stated in my Kingston SD card review I buy a lot of SD cards.
So many devices in my household.

For tablets and phones I tend to use Kingston as they offer a little better value when on sale and I don't care about data loss as things sync with cloud. Also for situations where they will get lost etc. (damned kids)

For anything that requires high capacity and storage speeds, Sandisk extreme is in my opinion the only real option.
I always keep a few 64 and 128GB cards ready to go with my GoPros.

These cards just work no matter what type of footage you are recording. I have never had one fail despite a few accidental washings with jeans.

I also use these cards in my dash cams. Main reason is a dashcam in the window of a car can get hot and these seem to handle the heat better than some others.

You can save money buy buying from other brands however after purchasing what must be over 50 cards over the years SanDisk Extreme are my only cards for 4k and 8k recording.",5

99,"Robust design, bad choice of materials.","Would not recommend these headphones: the earpads are made out of leather and the headphones are too tight.

This leads to the leather being pushed against your ears with quite a lot of force. Although decently comfortable at first, it quickly becomes uncomfortable; your ears start paining.

Since this is leather, your ears' heat is quickly absorbed by the leather too. In around 5-10 mins, it becomes very warm due to your body heat, making it even more uncomfortable to wear. There is a noticeable difference in temperature when you take it off for a few minutes and then wear it again.

So if you wear it for more than 20 mins, you can expect your ears to hurt a lot, and also be a few degrees hotter than the rest of your body (which doesn't help with the pain).

It could've been a 5/5, recommendable product. But, due to the aforementioned problems, it's become a 3/5 and non-recommendable due to how uncomfortable it is to wear for extended periods of time.

The hinge is also subpar; it's a little plastic that can easily wear out. After a few minutes of turn the cups around, it wore away enough to the point where it no longer works",3

 If you are planning to also use it for making calls (phone, whatsapp, hangout etc.), then you would really repent it. You would sound hollow and unclear to the other person, even when there is no background noise. In my test I switched between BT and Phone while talking and it made huge different to the other side. I attached the voice recorded on the other side as a video, you can play see the difference yourself.

Music sounds fine though I didn't do any specific test and wasn't looking for anything extraordinary in that department anyway. In the short test that my son said, he didn't like the music even compared to his existing cheap bluetooth over the ear headset.

The design is not very comfortable, it projects out of the ear and can easily get knocked off (e.g., when you are adjusting your hair, or attending to some itch).

I already had a pair of Redmi Earbuds that I had had shipped from China (before it was launched in India) and had been happy with the music quality, Bluetooth range, battery capacity (both for the buds and the case), passive noise cancellation, as well as the price. The Redmi Earbuds S are also similarly impressive, although the issue of lag that exists with the basic version still does exist on these buds as well, so they may not be the best thing for gaming, but they serve almost all other purposes very well.

This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only.

2197,Detailed Review// Unexpected üò≤,"First of all a very big thank you to Amazon great Indian sale as I bought this device for 46,249 and I really did not expect that I would get iPhone 11 at this price I‚Äôm truly very happy that I could wait all this long to buy a new phone. Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years.
Well I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality.
No let‚Äôs talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage & I am really a heavy user.
Camera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it‚Äôs a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn‚Äôt give the best quality & filed of view.
Talking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it.
I don‚Äôt know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù
The face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn‚Äôt work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best.
Now talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes.
Talking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn‚Äôt break.
Talking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it.
So I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won‚Äôt be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery.
.
.
.
I was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it‚Äôs a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; ü§ûüèºI really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn‚Äôt face any issue in terms of packaging.",4
9815,Nice product,Super experience,5
1705,Cheap plastics and poor sound quality,After using few days i came to know this is very very cheap product which not worth for 1800rs we can get these type of quality TWS for 800-900/- in outer market. Go for oneplus wireless z instead of these they worth the price.,2
13146,Not good,The behavior of the distribution executive was not good,2

21695,Wonderful,It's a nice smartwatch with many features the only things of concern are sometimes it doesn't synchronise or takes very long to sync with the application the other concern is screen size so if you have muscular forearms it may look little bit small on your hand.

6112,Powerful,"The product was good until it stopped working after 6 months. Has been using for a small family, so not much continuous usage, still it stopped responding within a short period of time. Moreover, the manufacturer will not repair the product under warranty since the invoice doesn't have the serial number of the product.

Since amazon delivers the product without opening the product, there is no way amazon could add serial number on the invoices, but not sure why the manufacturers demanding the serial number on the invoices.",4
12802,Slightly disappointed,"Wire quality is worst, not working after 6months of use. Tried for warranty but they have closed this issue becoz of physical damage.

Write - for large 4 GB file starts at 60MBPS, falls off to 20 MBPS
For many small files varies between 9 MBPS - 25 MBPS.

2381,Don't fall for Amazon Marketing. Honestly!,"Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.

I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.

Pros
1. Professional delivery.
2. Product received as described.
3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.
4 Received a made in India device.

Cons
1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.
I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.
2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.
3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.

Conclusion:
If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.",3

This is useless monitor. Go for some other monitor which has good durability and also a good advise would be go for something where the edge of the screen is a little covered with protection. This monitor edge is actually the screen edge and this will crack by simple touch. This is made of cheap material.,3

PROS :

The battery performance was really excellent!
Unbelievable battery I am really impressed.

only 22% battery drained after 1 and half hour continue free fire gaming and 1 hour and 40 min screen on time after game

CONS : reality of sales

It was my first bad experience and worst!
The Amazon sended me a used Iphone 11 , where the packaging plastic has 2-3 scratches and inside the box
1. ""IPHONE 11 HAS DENTS 1st on the top right corner just near camera and
2nd on lower left side on the steel ..I am really disappointed with this service..
2. IF YOU are buying Iphone 11 for camera than don't go for it cuz it clicks the worst photo in night and specially in night mode.
The picture quality get burst even in normal night photo even if u have a tubelight on still...
It only clicks Superb photos in sunlight.
And seriously,
They forced me to think that the phones ordered during are are really used and worst , from nowadays I won't buy any product during sale and will buy personally from Apple store near me.

It works fine while watching video or listen to music. But it does not work well after few months on call. You will face connectivity issues (sound will break) during the call even in the full range of network area. In the same call if you disconnect buds and try to switch over phone sound, you will not see any issues.",3

1228,Okay for low budget..!! You can go for it.,"Review after one day usage

Bought this on first day when launched, got delivered in 7 days..! Okay considering recent scenario of covid, actually I‚Äôm impressed.

Pros:
1. Sound quality is good, however on low volume you will not get a very good experience. Overall it‚Äôs satisfactory considering price. Not more core music lovers.
2. Looks good
3. Very lightweight
4. In ear built design hence its good in looks when you wear them
5. Buttons are soft touch, easy to use not that problematic
6. Call quality: Ok this is not that bad, But also not that good, other person will hear some echo sometime. Also outer voice will come more to the recipient than your own voice. If u are sitting in a quiet place its good. U can take this for normal calling or calling while driving but don‚Äôt take this if u are looking primarily for a calling device. I have used other TWS but calling is not good in any of them, however redmi earbuds is better as compared to them.
7. Mat finish, perfect black colour which i can match with my black iphone 8 plus and black i watch üëåüèª
8. No touch sensors hence no chance of disconnecting calls mistakenly
9. Well recognised brand, warranty, u can trust the company

Cons:
1. Slippery case, u can‚Äôt pull earbuds out of the box very easily. Need to use both hands to open case.
2. It completely seals the ears, u can‚Äôt even notice how loud u started talking over call.
3. Battery is ok, not great
4. No sound track change feature
5. You can‚Äôt increase or decrease volume

Overall its good if u are looking for earbuds with not a apple like design (because it looks like cheap brands copied product, which I don‚Äôt like) and your budget is 1799 max.
However if u can afford more than this price range like 3000-4000 you should search for other better option.

PS: I don‚Äôt play much games hence not checked latency mode.",4

2448,From 6S to 11,"My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.
package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it‚Äôs delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I‚Äôm the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there‚Äôs no question of sending refurbished device.
Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S. Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.
Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.

But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.

The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.

One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.
I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..
He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.

So here i am writing this.

I Previously used to tuned my equaliser for getting all these results in balance and VOILA, This little thing is already giving all that without tweaking any equaliser. GREAT WORK XIAOMI, I'm Happy with my money spent good.

4 Stars for sound quality because the moment i switched from my mi handsfree to this beauty the first thing I observed that mids are a bit muddier , which general listeners won't observe over long use. I think i need to rouse the drivers before writing in depth comparison with wired handsfree.

EDIT: MIDS ARE IMPROVED TO AN EXTENT AFTER DRIVER ROUSING (CONTINUOUS PLAYING).
All the people crying out for bad calling experience, it'll need an explanation as I've used this on two devices, i.e. Redmi note 3 with BSNL and Poco X2 with Jio, And the person on other side was complaining about a jitter in voice only when i called him with RN3. With Poco X2, Calls were magnificent, which means that poor quality might be an issue with your device and operator's signal quality+strength.

Connectivity wise its alright, pairs in a couple of seconds with phone and themselves, nothing to review about.

FINAL VERDICT
You won't get this quality, experience and feature anywhere in whopping ‚Çπ1800/-. I Feel bad for all those who reviewed it as a bad product. Believe me everybody wants to compare its quality with wired headsets which is technically wrong and and and stop comparing this with Apple's airpods or Samsung's earbuds.

- Range is superb. I kept my phone in one room and walked 3 rooms past it, and even then it was working. No lagging/voice cut till 10m at least.

- Voice assistance is working fine. Tried 4-5 times playing different songs, it worked.

- Battery life is very good. I have used them for about 3 hours continuously on calls already without charging/keeping in case.

BOUGHT IF FOR 599 INR
writting review after 1 day usage
had used many boat products before

#PROS:--
*sound quality is best in this price range (5/5)
highs are very crisp , mids are clear, but lows are
almost killed due to addition of extra bass.
*build quality is descent nothing too special or
fancy , specially it is light weight still feels solid
*3.5 mm Jack is made up of metal and comes with a
spring and spring prevents it from breaking wire in
long term rough use
*padding is ok can wear it for 1 to 1.5 hrs after that
ears starts to pain.

# major CONS :--
* THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT WHEN U PLAY
MUSIC THE SOUND LEAKS OUTSIDE
i mean if very less sound is leaked then its ok but it
is extremlu loud even it can be annoying to u as
anyone sitting beside you can hear what r u
listening . for refrence u can take u r playing musuc
with your phone at volume at 2 level with ur
phone's speaker than the sound u hear is as same
as the sound leaked from headphones.

*as they are on ear headphones they r not too
comfortable specially for long time of continuous
use . So if uh spend more than 2 hrs. continuously
then better add some more money and get over
ear headphones

# minor CONS :--
*3.5 mm Jack is not gold plated
*no bearded or kevelar cable like usb cable and aux
cable made by boat, its just plastic with ok quality
*the microphone button is very tight/hard to press
and requires a bit of extra force which is annoying
*their is no seal on box (this is not only my case )for
this headphones u never get seal on box . Common
boat wtf is this its just a piece of tape .
*if u wear galsses then u should have to remove
them as the frame of glasses sits behing ur ear and
the headphones apply inward pressure on ur ear so
ur ear may start to pain due to glasses

I HOPE IN NEST VERSON OF PRODUCT BOAT WILL FOX THEASE ISSUES

8381,Great quality,Everything is good about this monitor but it has white backlit bleed spreading from entire width of top of the monitor making every flat title bars a bit round which is visually annoying to me.,5
8219,"Great monitor, very very satisfied.","I like everything about it. At this price point, the features offered make it excellent when it comes to value for money. But, what I did not like is the pathetic product design.
First of all the stand base is a light weight plastic, which is very fragile and barely manages the weight of monitor. It puts the monitor under unstable equilibrium. Meaning, a slight push and your monitor falls bam on the table!!

So, I had to buy a heavy stand separately. But what happened next left me wondering about how a company of stature like LG could approve such a product design. The base stand when pulled out leaves a stand neck attached to the bottom of the monitor. Now, this stand neck has been fastened on screws from inside of the back panel. That means, for me to be able to use my new stand, I need to disassemble the monitor first, unscrew the stand neck, assemble it back again and then mount it on my new stand or even on the wall for that matter.
I had to take my monitor to LG service center to get that neck removed.",5
8146,Pleased with the quality. Beats all competitors in same price range IMO,"Monitor is good but it's software doesn't work in windows environment when connected with VGA cable, need to check with HDMI cable

This is the cheapest junk you can buy. It stopped working after 6 months and got repaired in warranty, then again it stopped working after 13 months and now HP is asking 5000 rupees to repair it.

2231,A premium device for a moderate user.,"I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.

I had iPhone 5s as my first phone. It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.

I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster. Will update the review after few months.

Build quality is remarkable.

IOS 14 is a magic.

Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.

Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.

I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision. Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.

Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.
If you are a photo person, this one is for you.

Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship, be ready for repeated charge cycles. üòÖ

This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.

Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.

Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.
Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.

Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. üòçüòç",5

The sound quality, bass effect and nice cancellation was equivalent to the top brands earbuds. The design of the case was simply superb, compact to handle and the earbuds was well coupled inside the box, there is no chance for accidentally falling out.

I received the device, put it on charge and took out the earbuds from the box and the device name was instantly populated on my mobile and it got paired easily. I was about to play music and receive call, the experience was hassle free.

Both the earbuds sits properly in the ears, and its not slipping out which helps me to use them at gym during workout.",5

I bought this card a while ago and don't believe always in instant reviews because they are not always accurate. Several months on, this card is still performing as it should giving me no problems transferring the data to hard drive or any file corruption issues.

Well worth going for a brand with a good reputation, and few are as affordable as Sandisk while still having a great track record.

The only con I found with this earbud is the mic quality, the person at the other end can hear you but distortion is always there.

Cons:
1. Sound could have been much better in terms of clarity of voice. It sounds to deep

Overall, i think you can go for this product if you are looking only for truly wireless earphones in this price segment. Its paisa wasool
If you donot care much about truly wireless and just want a wireless earphone, then there are much better options available out there. Oppo enco m31 is one of them.

2219,Coming from Androids planning to stay.,"Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it.

Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it.

Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup.

Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance.

There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem.

I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify.

For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge.

The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour.

PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too",5

I checked the memory card in my pc and tried formating it in FAT32 format but the error comes up everytime as a write protected device. I finally used AOMEI PARTITION ASSISTANT and formated the memory card in FAT32 and initially it showed ""unable to execute the operation due to error code 106"" which translates to bad physical sector. Upon continuous repeated effort, the card somehow started working in the camera. Initially a lot of glitches came up and sometimes the sensitivity of the cam acts crazy as if it has its own intelligence but over all the memorycard which I had received wasn't that much of pleasing product. Initial impressions were already chaotic and rather scary. Someone invests in a product like this and gets such dramas thrown at like write protected, definitely it won't be a pleasant experience at all. Since I have the technical knowledge to some extent, I was able to rectify the problem in my product, but many may not be that capable.",3

Pros-

‚Ä¢The case quality is good.
‚Ä¢Battery life is decent in daily usage.
‚Ä¢ Instant and good range in Bluetooth connectivity.
‚Ä¢Portable and handy is daily usage.

Cons-
‚Ä¢ No Type-c port for charging.
‚Ä¢ Though it supports gaming mode( which gets activated on triple tap on either earbuds) the latency still persist.
‚Ä¢The lid quality of case not good, however it won't break if you are not a rough user.

2639,Great phone with a few hiccups.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros:
I‚Äôve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.

Cons:
I didn‚Äôt believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it‚Äôs Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it‚Äôs a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It‚Äôll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it‚Äôs extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I‚Äôm always wearing a mask and cannot face id.

Overall it‚Äôs a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.

EDIT: After 1 year of usage, this isn't a phone it's simply an inconvenience, and the worst RAM management ever, once your phone is full with media, it's close to impossible to transfer photos to a HD or a Laptop it keeps on giving errors, I'm trying for months, and so it's full, the apps continuously keep crashing and phone heats up a lot. I wish to use a huge hammer on it, and if that Steve Jobs wasn't dead already, I'd be after him to not kill but torture him the way he's doing me. DO NOT R.I.P. newb.",1

LG support simply saying this is physical damage and not covered under warranty. But they can't show the brocken part physically, simply saying physical damage basis on black line. I believe that black line and screen faulty due to heating in summer. But, they simply saying physical damage. Monitor work till night, i slept without power off, when i wake up next day, its not working.
Worst Warranty support by LG.",4

3060,DO NOT BUY IT - Warranty Only means customer support help,"Changing my review from good to bad. Because in just 7 months the printer started showing problems . Claiming warranty takes forever which FYI means a customer support executive to just hear your complain with nothing done in real.. The ink leaks . Printer throws out blank papers even after and keeps on automatically restarting. It doesn't even recognize new cartridge. Pathetic printer. DO NOT BUY IT IF ITS FOR DAILY USE. BECAUSE ONCE IT STOPS WORKING IT IS GOING TO SPOIL YOUR DAY, EVERYDAY",1

6021,Very poor quality sub-standard product from Prestige,"Having bought a couple of Samsung Micro SD cards in the past 3 months both of which have failed, I decided to try a SanDisk card instead. They have great reliability reviews online but I have always thought them to be on the expensive side.

Experience has now shown me that sometimes it's better to spend a little more for better reliability. There is even a free downloadable rescue app, which I hope I'll never need but very useful to have. Performance in my action camera was much better than expected. These were on a great offer so I took the plunge.",1

3082,Good product at this price tag,"I have used HP printer in past but that was long time ago and now this is my 2nd HP printer. Overall the product is good at this price tag, but I am sure some improvements can be done to enhance user experience. Fit and finish of product is good and is light weight.
1) Installation software needs to be downloaded from HP website and installation is smooth. Software is not very user friendly though
2) I faced issue with my 1st print as after installation of software it was just not printing. But later is started printing after a reboot and about 15 mins
3) Print quality is ok and bit slow, as we expect from a Deskjet printer. (Please don't compare print quality with Laser printer)
4) Scanning is good, scans perfectly but its slow (specially with high DPI). I faced one issue with the software wrt scanning. I can save a PDF with multiple pages in 200 DPI but it does not work with 600 DPI. Maybe HP can provide a resolution or improve the software
5) Last but not the least, Ink cartridges. I am sure these small cartridges with the printer won't even last 100 pages. Most of my printing is black, but even a black one will not last 100 pages. So buying new cartridges at 600-800 per piece is a rip off. Better deal with refilling to have economical printing

Overall its a good product.",4

The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money.

It is also revealed that the supplier's name is incorrect, when I entered the details of the supplier on the website of canon, which is the same as shown in the invoice. To net result is that the warranty is reduced by two and a half months. I have reason to believe that it is a used product. The vendor is expected to you answer my doubts",5

It has cheap rate and accordingly cheap sound quality. But as usual, Boat has done an amazing work to maintain its premium build. Looks like a premium headphones. Also the bass is as usual a notable plus point of these headphones. Also unlike others said in the reviews, I don't feel any ears pain even after using them continuously for 5 hours.

Pros: that battery, that camera, iOS, Apple care.

Whenever I drive the car, I miss once. So I feel very good after this earbuds. It gives me 5 hours of battery time.

4) Charging in less than one hour.
5) Amazing bass.

4058,"If data is important to you, you must use it.","I rec'd my Dual SanDisk yesterday and when I tried it on my Samsung Galaxy M31s, I did not feel any response from the phone. I wanted to return it then and there but then consulted some youtube videos referring to my phone model. I found that people are using OTG feature with this phone.

Ultimately, I decided to download and install Memory Zone app. After this installation, the OTG drive was recognised and started functioning the way it should. This app is already supplied with this drive but the phone was refusing to read the contents of this drive hence the problem.

In this regard, I found Redmi phones much more user-friendly than Samsung.

I had opted for 64GB drive which I got. Once it is installed and working, it is very convenient and useful item. If you have important data (photos and videos etc.) in your phone which you cannot afford to lose, it is highly recommended that you copy your data to this dual drive everyday. I have lots of friends who, when their phone is lost or when the phone is dropped accidentally and the data is irrecoverable, they are more sorry for their lost files than for their phone.

Nothing proves cheaper, easier and more sensible to copy your pics, videos and other important data in this OTG dual drive. It is easy and lightening fast.",5

Pros:

1. Average sound quality, its quite good for the price range
2. Vey less lag, gaming experience is good even without gaming mode
3. Microphone quality is good, been using it for calls

Cons:

1. Poor build quality, the buds do not always fit into the case properly and have to remove it multiple times before charging starts

Coming to the review, they lack tuning. Sounds a little better with Dolby Atmos devices.
Pros-
1. Best Value for money
2. Sounds descent with Dolby Atmos devices
3. Splash proof
4. Pairs automatically when taken out of the case
5. Tactile button prevents shadow touch over
touch sensitive controls
6. Fits almost every ear size and is comfortable to

7. Gaming mode but not that great in latency test.
CONS-
1. Muddy and feeble sound as compared to more
expensive counterparts

3. Can't connect to more than one device at a time
4. Not waterproof
5. Average battery life
6. Bad feedback to know if gaming mode is
enabled or disabled.
7.No AAC codec supported but not a great issue
8. International Manufacturing Standards- Safer
to prevent hearing loss.

- plugs block lot of sounds.

Cons-
- mediocre sound, mids and highs are muted so music sounds very soft with bass. I use equalizer to bring out details. I primarily use Audio technica m40x, and apple earpods. Bought Redmi 2c just for convenience.

- uncomfortable for me. Even the smallest tip hurts my ear canal.

- buttons are hard to press

It is for those who listen to bassy or party music the bass is inherent.I couldn't even reduce the bass using equalisers so that vocals and background music could get better didn't work though. Now coming to the quality It doesn't give a premium feel but yes it feels quite durable. Boat is definitely better option.,2
5972,best Mixer Grinder in market,"For those who say ""Its is only 119gb"" That is correct when Read By Windows . The reason for this difference lies in the way hard drive manufacturers advertise their devices, versus the way Windows computers actually use the storage devices. ... Unfortunately, Windows has always calculated hard drives as powers of 1024 while hard drive manufacturers use powers of 1000. So when windows reads it its calculating every gig as chunks of 1024 so for every 1024 mb it reads 1 gig . So for windows to use 1gb it requires More then 1000mb, hence the 1024. Windows will read it Less than the Manufactures stated Total Capacity . They ARENT FAKE its only Computer illiteracy and understandable, its confusing to the average person . THESE ARE REAL and WORK FINE . Stop Rating 1 stars because you dont know any better .",5

Go for it if u want a compact goodlooking TWS earphone for gaming or calling or listening to podcasts.Fit is good and the best part is that its very small,2

I have tried several overhead headphones and they all fit my head although some were a bit too tight, that was resolved by extending the overhead.

Opini√≥n original:
Vaya por delante que lo de ""hasta 160 MB/s"" me parece una marcianada, de hecho UHS-I tiene un l√≠mite de 104 MB/s como ya pone un poco m√°s arriba y no est√° muy claro cu√°les son esos ""dispositivos compatibles"".
Dejando el tema de la velocidad te√≥rica a parte, SanDisk es mi marca de referencia para tarjetas de memoria y la gama Extreme no defrauda. Velocidad aproximada de 90MB/s de lectura y 80MB/s de escritura en mi unidad. Cumple con creces la certificaci√≥n U3/V30. La A2 imagino que tambi√©n aunque no la he intentado medir.

Por cierto, como todas las SanDisk Extreme, incluye una licencia de un a√±o para el software RescuePro Deluxe, pero en este caso viene pegada a la parte interna del blister de cart√≥n. Mala idea. Seguro que m√°s de uno lo tira a la basura sin darse cuenta.",1

Just Got it... Received today.
----------------------------------------
Bass was SuperB. I am using Snapdragon Audio+ and Bass was outstanding on mobiles ü§© BUT Laptop Output had Low Bass üòû. But the Punches and Thump i felt from the pads when playing music on mobile was great.
----------------------------------------
Pads are really soft and comfortable on the ears..
Wire Quality is Good and soft as well.

No Inner Ear pain.. I used it for 1 hour continuously, but the auricle of the ear was paining because of tight grip it gets on your head after 1 hour. üòñLoose it by stretching it up on the book.

And Lastly Jack is well built with springs on the end for long lasting.

19835,Decent product,"Battery life is good if you are not actively monitoring heartbeat. Battery life extends for a week if you put it on DND.. otherwise it will come for 3-4 days only.

Sync activities also not happening between phone and watch. Need to try multiple times.",3
2147,A detailed review,"After 3 months of usage, It feels smooth and it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve used an IOS device. Following are few points describing the product.
1) Screen and display:
The screen is quite comfortable to look at and the adaptive display works excellent. The transition from one app to another is so smooth and satisfying. The display adapts according to lighting and quite easy on the eyes. There‚Äôs blue light filter (true tone) which gives a warm hue to the display. Brightness when set to max is excellent even in day light.
2) Software:
Currently on IOS 14, the interface is to a next level. It took few days to adapt according to the interface but now, every app is smooth and easy to use.
The face unlock is so accurate as it uses infrared light and smart unlock. That means no one can unlock your phone while you‚Äôre asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot‚Äôs of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security! Each and every bit of data is safe on your device.
3) battery
As I‚Äôm not a heavy gamer, the battery is enough for an entire day or 2 at max. Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple‚Äôs 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you‚Äôre a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging.
4) camera
Well it‚Äôs iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you‚Äôre into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone‚Äôs camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid.
Few cons of the device
1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don‚Äôt find it annoying but few people may.
2) Phone may heat a little during charging.
3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot.",5

Battery is good compared to previous iPhone models . But if you play high end games like PUBG (continues), you will only get 5-6 hours of battery backup.

2046,Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.
But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.
1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.
2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.

Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.
1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.
2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.
3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.
4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.
5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.
6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.",5

48,Overall good product but not as good as motorola pulse 2,"Good product overall, but the ear pads are too large and the sponge is a bit unbreathable, comparing to Motorola Pulse 2 at similar proce point , clearly my preference would be Motorola Pulse 2 over this product.
I also feel a bit heavy/louder sound on the right earpiece compared to left one. But that might be clearly a problem with my hearing.
I miss the feature of a completely detachable and replacable headphone cable in this product , which is present in the pulse 2 which makes it really convenient for repairs and long life. If the cable is damaged in pulse 2 you can simple buy an aux cable and you headphone will be good as new. Also the detachable feature protecs the cable from tearing in case of a sudden jolt as the cable simply unplugs in motorola pulse 2.
I wish this feature will abe also available in boat headphones soon enough and that they also make thw ear pads more soft and breathable for extra comfort.",3

5922,Great looking and color i love it and powerful motor 750 is awesome grinding machine,"Seit Jahren setze ich in meinen Kameras SANDISK Speicher ein.

Auch diese Speicherkarte ist ein Sandisk Qualit√§tsprodukt und mit einer lebenslangen Garantie ausgestattet.
Die wichtigen Performanceangaben dieser Karte lauten U3 und V30.

Damit ist die Karte durch die V30 Angabe f√ºr 4K Aufnahmen mit 60 fps und auch 120 fps in Video Kameras, Drohnen und anderen Aufzeichnungsger√§ten geeignet. In meinem Fall soll sie in einer DJI Mavic Air ihren Dienst verrichten.
Zur √úberpr√ºfung der Performance habe ich mit der Version 6.02 des kostenlosen Tools ‚ÄûCrystal Disk Mark‚Äú die Karte an meinem PC mit Hilfe eines USB 3.0 UGREEN Card Readers getestet. Das Testergebnis habe ich als Screenshot beigef√ºgt.

Die erzielten Performance Werte von 94,02 MB/s beim sequentiellen LESEN und 66,19 MB/s beim sequentiellen SCHREIBEN best√§tigen die ausgezeichnete Performance dieser Karte.
Einen Stern Abzug gibt es aber f√ºr die mir unverst√§ndlich erscheinende Aussage auf der Verpackung, wonach die Karte bis zu 160 MB/s Leserrate erzielen soll. Ich frage mich, wie man auf diese Angabe kommt. Die Schreibrate ist mit ihren tats√§chlichen 66,19 MB/s sogar 10% h√∂her als vom Hersteller angegeben.

Herstellerangaben auf der Verpackung:
Speed up to 160 MB/s read ‚Äì 60 MB/s write

Die Karte habe ich f√ºr 25,99 EUR hier bei Amazon gekauft und sie erh√§lt von mir eine klare Empfehlung, gerade auch im Hinblick auf den recht g√ºnstigen Preis. Schnell kann man n√§mlich f√ºr eine 64 GB Sandisk Extreme Pro (schwarz/rot) deutlich mehr Geld bezahlen (43,- EUR), obwohl sie lt. Spezifikation auch ‚Äûnur‚Äú V30 und U3 bietet. Sie mag im praktischen Test sicher bessere Werte liefern, wenn aber die Anforderungen des Ger√§tes mit einer Karte f√ºr weniger Geld auch erf√ºllt sind, muss man nicht zwingend mehr als n√∂tig zahlen.

Einige erkl√§rende Worte zu SD Speicher und ihren Spezifikationen

Ein Ausflug in das Bezeichnungswirrwarr von Speicherkarten, wobei ich die Reihenfolge nach ihrer Relevanz im heutigen Einsatz aufgef√ºhrt habe.

1. Kapazit√§tsangaben von SD Speicherkarten

SD: Secure Digital Memory Card mit bis zu 4GB Speicherplatz
SDHC: steht f√ºr High Capacity mit 4GB bis zu 32GB Speicher
SDXC: steht f√ºr Extended Capacity mit 64GB bis 2TB Kapazit√§t

2. V-Angabe Video Speed ‚Äì Mindest Schreibrate speziell bei VIDEO Aufnahmen

Die wichtigste Information beim Einsatz einer Speicherkarte als Video Aufnahmemedium stellen diese speziellen Performance Angaben dar, die leicht verst√§ndlich auswertbar sind.
Nat√ºrlich sind die U1, U2 und U3 Angaben (siehe weiter unten) sehr aussagef√§hig, wenn es um die Performance einer Speicherkarte geht. Mit der Angabe der Video Speed Class (V) kann man jedoch sofort erkennen, ob die Karte f√ºr die ben√∂tigte Aufnahme ausreichend schnell die Aufnahmedaten schreiben kann.
Der V-Wert gibt die MINIMALE Geschwindigkeit an, mit der VIDEO-Daten auf die Karte geschrieben werden. So kann man leicht ersehen, welche Karte f√ºr den ben√∂tigten Einsatzzweck notwendig ist.

V6 Video Schreibrate mindestens 6 MB/s
geeignet f√ºr 720p sowie 1080p und 1080i Aufnahmen

V10 Video Schreibrate mindestens 10 MB/s
geeignet f√ºr Full HD Aufnahmen und Echtzeit√ºbertragung

V30 Video Schreibrate mindestens 30 MB/s
geeignet f√ºr 4K Aufnahmen mit 60 fps und auch 120 fps

V60 Video Schreibrate mindestens 60 MB/s
geeignet f√ºr 8K Videoaufnahmen mit bis zu 120 fps

V90 Video Schreibrate mindestens 90 MB/s
geeignet f√ºr 8K Videoaufnahmen mit bis zu 120 fps

3. Karten Klassen Class 2,4,6, 10 und U1, U2 U3

Fr√ºher waren die Class 2,4,6 und 10 Angaben noch oft verbreitet und √ºblich, die heute aber kaum noch f√ºr aktuelle Einsatzzwecke ausreichende Performance bieten. Die Zahlen hinter den Class Angaben geben die Mindest Schreibraten an. Eine MicroSd Class 10 Karte ist mit 10 MB/s SCHREIB Rate ausgestattet, eine Class 2 nur mit 2 MB/s.
Aktuelle Karten besitzen die neueren U Bezeichnungen.

U1 f√ºr 10 MB/s Schreibrate
U2 f√ºr 20 MB/s Schreibrate
U3 f√ºr 30 MB/s. Schreibrate

Geht es um Anwendungen im 4k oder 8k Video Aufnahme Modus, kommen nur U3 Karten in Betracht, die entsprechend hohe Werte bei der Schreibrate aufweisen. Aussetzer oder Abbr√ºche und Fehlermeldungen w√§hrend der Video Aufzeichnung k√∂nnen die Folge sein, wenn eine Karte nicht die vom Ger√§t ben√∂tigte Video Schreibrate zur Verf√ºgung stellt.

4. A-Angabe - Applikation Performance (Smartphones)

Diese Angabe ist f√ºr den Einsatz vor allem in Smartphones relevant, da damit die Mindest- Schreib und Leserate einer SD Karte definiert ist, wenn die Karte vom Telefon oder Tablet als aktiver Speicher genutzt wird. Die Performance wird damit in Abh√§ngigkeit der Input/Output operations Per Second angegeben. Je gr√∂√üer der IOPS-Wert, desto schneller ist der Datentr√§ger bei Einsatz in einem Smartphone oder Tablet. Hier kommt es weniger auf die maximale Schreibgeschwindigkeit an, sondern darauf, wie viele Operationen pro Sekunde auf bzw. mit der Karte m√∂glich sind.

A1 Mindestleserate bei 1500 IOPS; Mindestschreibrate bei 500 IOPS
A2 Mindestleserate bei 4000 IOPS; Mindestschreibrate bei 2000 IOPS

5. Interface Spezifikationen UHS und Klassen I, II, III

Damit es noch etwas verwirrender wird, wurde auch f√ºr das Interface noch eine spezielle Spezifikation definiert. Nicht jede Karte l√§uft n√§mlich auch in jedem Ger√§t. Dazu muss man wissen, dass sowohl auf Karten-, als auch auf Ger√§te Seite Definitionen des Daten√ºbertragungssystems existieren.

UHS-I:
Spec. V 3.01 mit 12,5 MB/s (SDR12), 25 MB/s (SDR25), 50 MB/s (SDR50, DDR50) oder 104 MB/s (SDR104)

UHS-II:
Spec. V 4.00 oder 4.01 mit 156 MB/s (FD156) bzw. 312 MB/s (HD312)

UHS-III:
Spec. V 6.0 mit 312 MByte/s (FD312) oder 624 MByte/s (FD624)

√Ñltere SD Speicherkarten, die eine UHS Kennzeichnung besitzen, sind mit SDXC und SDHC Karten kompatibel. Ohne eine zus√§tzliche Kennzeichnung der Klasse in Form einer I, II oder III kann die Datenrate jedoch niedriger sein.

Nachwort
MB/s Megabyte pro Sekunde ist NICHT zu verwechseln mit Mbit/s also Megabit pro Sekunde.
Die Internet Datenleitung liefert Daten nach Hause. Die Daten √úbertragungsrate wird hier in Mbit/s angegeben. Ein Internet Anschluss hat beispielsweise 50 Mbit. Das heute √ºbliche Gigabit LAN zu Hause bietet eine √úbertragungsrate von 1 Gbit/s. Das h√∂rt sich nach viel an, aber im Vergleich mit den Daten Schreib- und Leseraten der Speicherkarten, ist es nicht wirklich ann√§hernd so schnell. Nur das Gigabit LAN daheim kommt an die Geschwindigkeit von schnellen SD Karten heran.
Mit einem Gigabit LAN kann man theoretisch bis zu 125 MB/s √ºbertragen. In der Praxis wird man meist deutlich unter diesem Wert bleiben. Der 50 Mbit Internet Anschluss hingegen erm√∂glicht es Daten mit maximal 6,25 MB/s zu streamen (Empfang).

Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.",1

1225,Best TWS when comes to price to performance!,"Writing review after using it for 4 days
Considering the important criterias.
1)Sound quality:- 4/5 sound is clear, high, mids, lows are clear, but as you move away from the connected devices the sound get cut.
2) Battery backup:- 4/5 it says 4hrs but it lasts for 3.30hrs as by review done by youtubers, I've personally not tested it. And 43mAH each ear bud and 300mAH case. Approximately upto 12hrs with case.
3) Connectivity:- 3/5 bluetooth 5.0, it takes some sec to connect, but not too late, when i connected to my mobile redmi note 5, the range was long and clear but when i connected it to laptop, the sound started to break, after moving a very small distance, they say connectivity upto 10m.
4) Comfort:- 4/5 when you put it into ears you won't feel it, since it is just 41gm very light weight, adjust with your buds medium bud comes with fixed and you get small and large,else it will fall off, after sometimes you might feel uncomfortable for those for are trying in ear for the 1st time.
5)Bass:- 5/5 definitely i love the beats of this earbuds it uses 7.2mm driver, all the beats are very punchy and if you love beats this is definitely for your l.
6)Controls:- 3/5, since there is no option to skip songs and change volume it might be irritating to open your mobile and change it everytime. 1tap for pause/play, 2 taps to activate siri/google assistant and 3taps to activate low latency mode and other reset control given in manual. The thing i like is it comes with physical buttons, which won't get unnecessary touchs but when you press button the earbud may go further into your ears which you find annoying.
7) Build quality:- 3/5, looks premium but quality is not that good, it is made of plastic and earbuds are hard but box is bit delicate nice thing is it's small and compact.
8) Charging speed:-4/5 It comes with micro usb and it's bad, in 2020 you must get type c, but when compared to price it's ok. ""Note"":- You won't get any charger or cable, you must have one at your home. It takes 1.5hrs to charge buds and 2hrs to charge both completely, i didn't test it personally but according to redmi amd youtubers.
9)Water resistant:- 3/5 since it is ipx4 it is only splash and sweat resistant, pls don't put into water, many earbuds of same price range come with ipx5,6 , so it's bit annoying.
10)Low latency game mode:- 3/5, i played pubg by activating this mode by pressing the button 3 times, it says it has 122ms, but i could make some milli seconds delay, but it's ok when compared to some earbuds which doesn't have this feature.
11)Noise cancellation:- 5/5, it says it has dsp environmental noise cancellation and it's completely based on software, nothing hardware device to do that work, since it's in ear it performs this effect better.
12) Calling:- 3/5, this is not a big deal for me since i use this very less, it comes with dual mike and i spoke with 2 persons with both earbuds and with either of one, they said there eas no disturbance, but 3star because youtubers and some review said it's not that good, so this is not my personal opinion.
13) Finally when it comes to price to perform 5/5, very less price with great specifications
I hope this review is more than enough to decide whether to purchase or not. But I'm in love with it!!",4
2092,Best device ever by apple,"Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.

Pros:-
‚Ä¢Wide angle camera
‚Ä¢Supports fast Charing
‚Ä¢Stunning looks
‚Ä¢Superb Camera quality
‚Ä¢Safe and secure device
‚Ä¢Flagship A13 Bionic Chip

Cons:-

‚Ä¢The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp
‚Ä¢Still have huge notch
‚Ä¢Bit costly in India",5

Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.
On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.
Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.
Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.

5. Connectivity is also amazing.
I have been using this product for the last 2 days and here is my opinion on it.
The battery backup is good. The battery lasts 3-4 hours on regular mode . The build quality is good. The sound is the best under 2k. I've used many earbuds under 2k But these are so awesome.",5
18406,Slightly disappointed,"Using this app for one month now. This is a blunt review without any prejudice. The watch is descent in this price range. Works fine and have a battery backup of upto 8-9 days. But, the worst thing is the boat app. The app is pathetic, doesn't work properly, restarts the app on every sync. Many a times your step counts will go back to previous count. Overall, not recommended until boat fixes the app.",2
675,Reasonable price for very good quality,Ordered this a while back as my other earphones(samsung) had stopped working. Very satisfied with it's performance and audio input and output are also great,5
8175,Cheap Chinese product under LG brandname,Definitely on of the best budget monitor out there with 75hz refresh rate and full hd display. It has awesome ips panel that reproduce colors just about natural. viewing angles are very good. But when you view from angle color tends to fade a little. Though every display panel has this problem but its noticeable. Black is not fully black. You will find the led tint quite annoying in videos or gaming when scene is dark. But considering the price point its okay. I had to tinker around with the settings a bit to get the right color and brightness of my liking. The factory setup is very bright and vibrant that is not really suited for close viewing. Your eyes will feel the stress in less than an hour. but overall after a little bit of changing in settings this monitor will not disappoint you...So go for it..,2

8410,Offer Price 6300/-,"Been using for two weeks with my laptop via HDMI. NO Issues faced except when you plug in headphones directly to the monitor. There is some disturbance in background which becomes irritating. This can be remedied by not using headphone jack of the monitor at all. Also when you plug in both D-sub and HDMI, it takes time to detect the input and prefers D-sub over hdmi automatically which is problematic.",5

I have used these earbuds daily approx 2 hours for 4 days. I must say this, the battery backup is really great and Im very satisfied. Previously I was using boat rockerz 255r, so comparing it with the ear buds, the battery is surely good. The fitting is also really good.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.

WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Under the budget of 10,000,

a) It is among the very few monitors which are :

* 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),
* 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel)

b) And is the only one which has :

* 1) Free-sync technology,
* 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ)

Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.

ABOUT BRAND :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.

BASIC INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.

* Size 55.88cm (22)
* Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction)
* Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.)
* sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB)
* Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers)
* Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image )
* Resolution 1920 x 1080
* Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness)
* Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.)
* (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.)
* (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE)
* Viewing Angle(CR‚â•10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side)
* Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room)
* Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces)
* Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs)
* Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W
* Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.
* It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.
* Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.
* Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.
* You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.

BONUS INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.

I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.

You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.
You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.

Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.

THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.
In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.

Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,

1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output)

2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync)

Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.

Some basic things about Free-sync :

1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.

2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.

THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.
Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.

BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.

PROS :
::::::::::

* 1) Free-sync
* 2) Anti glare IPS screen
* 3) 75 Hz refresh rate
* 4) Crisp image quality
* 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.
* 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software
* 6) Best budget gaming monitor

CONS :
:::::::::::

* 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.
* 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.
* 3) Only one HDMI.
* 4) Shows some IPS glow.
* 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.
* 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.
* 7) No speakers

ALTERNATIVES :
::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).

CONCLUSION :
::::::::::::::::::::::

Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected. I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn‚Äôt hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.,5

Totally unhappy with this product.",2
2706,Value For Money,"First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you‚Äôll face no problem there.

Screen response time is very accurate there‚Äôs no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you‚Äôre not getting a charger from now it‚Äôs not bad.

When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can‚Äôt enjoy it in 720p screen but it‚Äôs there.

So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it‚Äôs around 55k so definitely if you‚Äôre going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.",5
462,Good bass.,"The pdct is really good. The audio,voice cancellation is perfectly fine. The effect of bass is really cool with this headset.

When asked how did this even happen with a brand new laptop, we were informed - ""electronic hai kuch bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai""

5975,Prestige is not worried about its prestige anymore.,"The number of devices that MicroSD cards work with now has increased demand, which in turn has really brought the price down of these fantastic cards. I don't use any other brand now that I know I can rely on SanDisk (having previously used them for several years without a fail in a dashcam and tablets).

On top of being ultra reliable, they come with A2 App performance. You may think A2 isn't as good as A1, but it actually means read and write speeds are at least doubled (usually more). This makes them ideal for recording video in a dashcam, CCTV camera or video doorbell that produces high definition video at a high frame rate (does footage look laggy if movement is fast?)

It comes with a microSD to SD adapter so that the card can be plugged directly into a card reader or laptop. It also comes with recovery software but I have never had to use it in the past and don't expect to in the future either.

I will continue to trust in and spend my money on SanDisk and recommend that you do the same. You will not be disappointed.

I followed the steps and it resolved it. Changed the rating from 1 to 4. As sound quality is good. Only thing they should provide more details about resetting.

Hardware reset steps:

¬∑ Long press and hold Multi-function button when earbud is out of case. Keep pressing, do not release. Put earbud into the case (do not release, keep pressing). Don't release until observe the LED turns red",4

3093,Best printer in this range.,"This printer is a very cool deal in this price point. You can print , scan and copy easily. I personally liked this product. It is best suitable for home use. However printing rate is a little slow but it produces high quality prints.
Based on my observations, I can say that -
1) Printing speed - 7/10
2) Print quality - 10/10
3) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/10
4) Durability - 9/10
5) Scanning - 10/10
6) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10

One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.
Otherwise everything is good.",5

Pros:
Great camera
Excellent software experience
Stereo speaker have depth in audio
Smooth animations
Battery can last upto 1 day if you are a causal user
Lag free gaming
Ip 68

Cons
Display üòñ though you won't notice it but if you pixel peep you can certainly find difference.
No fingerprint sensor. I feel fingerprint authentication is more convenient than face scanner.
Huge notch feels outdated.
Charging takes one eternity XD.

Verdict
If you want a phone for long term usage then you can go for it but if your priority is better display and better charging speed better go with OnePlus or some other devices. Rest be assured 5g won't come soon in India. Still I think it's better than iPhone 12 considering price.",5

It was just Bubble Wrapped !

18195,Could be way better,"Well it's good to have a watch in this budget. But the horrible thing is it's not very accurate. To be honest the accuracy is too bad. It's not even close especially step calculator which most people use the most. The app and the watch are not very compatible when you do synchronisation. Just to make fun or show off I think people can go for it. But for people who are little serious enough about the accuracy, just increase your budget and get a good one. And it's not recommended at all from my side. according to me it's just a waste of money. Please think accordingly before buying this type of value for money products.",2

5952,Good For house using within budget price,"Gute Speicherkarte aber : L√ºgt Sandisk dann auf der Verpackung ?

Selbstverst√§ndlich sind Speicherkarten von Sandisk eine ordentliche Marke.
Und nat√ºrlich l√ºgt Sandisk hier nicht !
Die Datensicherheit ist sicherlich gegeben.
Die Verarbeitung der Karte selber gef√ºhlt ist etwas schwach.
Die Geschwindigkeit ist OK, sie entspricht nur nicht im Geringsten des was auf dem Etikett steht. Zumindest auf dem ersten Blick.

Und hier f√ºhlt man sich als K√§ufer irgendwie veralbert. Ja und albern ist dies schon.

Ehrlich, warum tut sich das Sandisk an ?
L√ºgt Sandisk dann auf der Verpackung?

Nein, nat√ºrlich nicht! Und wenn man das kleingedruckte liest findet man heraus dass die Karte normal nur maximal 104 MB/s liefern kann. ES SEI den man nutzt einen speziellen Kartenleser von Sandisk. Dann bringt die Karte auch ungef√§hr die versprochenen Werte.

Die Karte kann an einem normalen Reader / Ger√§t / Kamera NIEMALS die versprochenen Leistungswerte erreichen. Da die Karte eben eine UHS I Karte ist und da ist eben bei 104 MB/s Schluss.

Mal offen in Raum gestellt, welche Kamera, welches Handy unterst√ºtzt den diese Propriet√§re Technologie au√üer einem Sandisk Karten Leser?
Ehrlich Sandisk, da f√§llt doch der Mehrwert f√ºr eure Kunden doch sehr mager aus.
Wo ist der Punkt in einer Karte mit UHS II Leistung und einer zu geringen Bus-Geschwindigkeit ?

Generell darf man sich auf die Zuverl√§ssigkeit des Flash Speichers sowie den internierten Controllers. Man darf auch annehmen, dass Sandisk nahe der Oberfl√§che des Substrates einige Testpunkte f√ºr eine eventuelle Datenrettung angebracht hat.
So etwas kostet ja nichts beim Design, aber hilft dann doch weiter.
Nat√ºrlich ist dies jetzt keine Endurance Speicherkarte sondern vermutlich eine ganz normale MLC Flash Karte.

Die Physikalische Verarbeitung von Sandisk Speicherkarten ist subjektiv immer etwa mager.
Das ist nur mein pers√∂nlicher Eindruck, aber ihrgendwie sind die Karten von Sandisk immer etwas weniger wertig in der Handhabung. Die Kontaktfl√§chen scheinen irgendwie d√ºnner zu sein. Fakt ist ich habe mehr √§u√üerlich defekte Sandiskkarten als von anderen Herstellern. Und eigentlich vermeide ich Sandisk Karten zu kaufen. Eben aus diesem Grund. (Aber Sandisk ist eben immer verf√ºgbar. )
Vielleicht ist dies einfach nur blindes Pech, aber die Karten anderer Hersteller erscheinen bei mir l√§nger halten zu sein. Vielleicht liegt es daran dass Sandisk Febless produzieren l√§st.
Hier wird die preiswerteste Fertigungsst√§tte w√§hlen welche noch die eigenen Kriterien und Standards gew√§hrleistet. Andersrum wird Sandisk auch nur genau das bekommen was spezifiziert ist. Dies hat Vor und Nachteile.

Fazit : Nicht meine erste Wahl aber Sandisk ist schon OK.",4

Go for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.",3

2024,First Time iPhone User Review :-),"The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.

Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.

The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).

Cons:

1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.

2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.

Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting finer details of terms and conditions during the offer in so many places that it‚Äôs impossible to take screenshots of complete offer and it‚Äôs serve the purpose for amazon tactically as you cant have all details handy with you when you will complain with their customer care regarding not receiving the cashback. usually cashback come to the customer account only after sales end, So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.

Soon it seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.

BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images taken from the iPhone is no doubt is best in the segment and hard for any phone to match that.

Camera, Video recording is not good if it is compared with my old Samsung Galaxy on 5pro, and Samsung Core M01

What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZON
Coming to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
The phone is incredibly beautiful.
Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.
Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.
Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.
With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.
Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.
Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.
The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.

Will be updating more with coming days.......üôÇ",4

8172,Great product. Must buy,"My rating is only to ascertain the fact that its a monitor that works . But, major dissapointed when I am spending above 8k on a product recommended on Amazon is that the monitor,its stand & the charger arrived in the package . NO VGA/HDMI cable . Amazon should out right ban these dealers who thrive on Consumer's money. Since I had to make it work, I bought the VGA& HDMI cable separately . I have complained about the Dealer and Amazon has not taken any action. Lastly , the monitor just powers on and off, you cannot change the Picture Mode,Input or go to Menu as displays on the monitor screen when you press the power button. But its India , who listens to Consumers ?
Sub standard product. If you are a buyer lookimg for a good monitor, no matter what rating this product has, go for a cheaper option as you may need to purchase the cables separately .",5

Third red flag was when I tried to copy data from my old sd card on to this one. I was able to get about 21.5 GB of data on to it until it unmounted itself from my computer. I then physically removed the card and inserted it back in the computer. Windows recommended that I repair the drive, so I did.

The quality is great for social media sharing so I don't bother in recording in the 2k or 4k option much but I did test the card out with a few 4K videos and it performed perfectly (better than the Ultra's but the playback from the ultra card in 4K recording could have been pc which isn't a 4k one. This is important to know as some people assume it is card error).
All in all a great product. Comes with an SD adapter too.",4

After using both the earbuds for sometime I am facing a kind of loose connection in between the movies or music audio and the earbuds.
Build quality is bellow average espically the case is pathetic.
Also faced pairing issues once or twice.
Sound quality is average.

Cons-

3- Gets paired even after putting in case, so I had to turn them off or turn my phone Bluetooth off to avoid pairing
4- Pathetic noise cancellation - People have complained that we can listen everything but you
5- Pain in ears after using for 2-3 hours ( despite changing ear tips)
NOTE- Dont go by Youtube reviews, they are not thorough, i got influenced by them only. If you just want to experience how TWS feels, you have 2-3 hours usage per day and no calling, ONLY then go for mi earbuds.",1

Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city.

5989,Prestige won't let yu down,"So I purchased this card for a nice little Windows tablet I purchased that only had a 128Gb internal storage eMMC drive which cost to half of the space taken up with Windows and so this allowed me to double it up and add an extra 128Gb for storage of my files for little cost.

Now this was purchased as I'd bought a cheaper brand the day before and had trouble writing to it so decided to buy this to see if a card issue and as this a brand I now well.

It arrived and comes complete with a full size SD card adaptor as well as the 128Gb Micro SD card, I popped it into the machine and I almost immediately see the 128Gb drive in my file explorer, it's formatted as exFAT yet again tried to write to the card and it said it was write protected, I tried formatting and hit the same issue, so I'm now thinking a machine issue. On a whim though I decided to hunt out a replacement SD card driver not using Windows Update and suddenly I had a fix, ecstatic and as I know knew both cards worked well I decided to test their read/write speeds etc and this card which should have been slightly faster actually came out slightly slower which was surprising as it was a higher rated card and more expensive. I can't comment on the longevity of the cards yet as obviously new but I think this one due to the slightly slower performance encountered and slightly higher price has to deserve 4 stars from me.",5

Appario sent this. And I have been buying their products.. So I trust Appario.

Best of all this is manufactured in Malaysia September 2020. So it s a new product.

Suggestion = if u want a drive that works in ur phone and computer. Go for it.
It works seemless with my oneplus too.

Good storage capacity.
Value for money.
Easy to use.",5

3128,For occasional printing this is fine otherwise it is expensive then it looks,"The printer is not useful unless you going to print 5 or 10 pages a month
Pros-
Print quality is good
Easy to install
Cons-
The ink is very expensive , the first time we have printer around 30 or 40 pages then we had to buy a black ink catridge which is around 750
When printing in bulk it does not print the pages correctly, eg if I give page 15 to 20, it prints some random pages like13, 17 and all

Bass is not that great( with the price being paid).
Would have better if these were priced at around 1-1.1k max.
Music lovers please don't go for it, all sounds get mixed up and you get that cracking sound when lots of instruments are being played.

Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.
Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.
When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly. Some other good features:
- Stereo speakers with great quality.
- iOS provides smooth user experience.
- The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good.
- Amazing video quality
- Excellent selfie photos.

1077,"Just an okay product. Detailed review, please read for more info.","Package contents of Redmi Earbuds 2C:

pair of earbud Redmi 2 c
additional ear tips (small and medium-size)
User manual

Redmi Earbuds 2C main highlights:

12 hours of music playback
Bluetooth 5.0
IPX4 water-resistant
Stylish and fashionable design
Multifunction button
Voice assistant
DSP ambient noise cancellation
Single or dual earbuds
Lightweight
Quick and easy to pair with the device

Redmi Earbuds 2C Battery Backup:

The Xiaomi company used the battery in the Redmi Earbuds 2C case is 300 mAh. Butt if you consider the battery in the earbuds separately then both of them have a 43 mAh battery.

The company claims that the Redmi Earbuds provide a battery backup of up 12 hours with a 2C charging case. So, when the earbuds are fully charged, then both earbuds provide up to 4 hours of playback/battery backup.

When using the Redmi Earbuds 2C continuously after a full charge, then if you use it at high volume then the buds gave up to 3 hours and 18 minutes of playback on a single charge.

If someone uses the earbuds at a volume level of 50-60%, then it gives you a playback time of 4 hours, which is quite reasonable.

Redmi Earbuds 2C Music Performance:

The Redmi Earbuds 2C has Bluetooth 5.0, which provides you a better wireless range of up to 18-20m. Bluetooth 5.0 provides a stable connection and better connectivity. Well, if you exceed the range then the connectivity will be lost.

If there is a crash between the smartphone and the Redmi Earbuds 2C, then the connection disrupts. The Bluetooth range is reduced to 8-9 meters when there is a wall or door or window present in between the smartphone and earbuds.

It doesn‚Äôt deliver deep bass and punch in the music when listening to multiple audio tracks. The user will get buzzing bass from the song. Redmi Earbuds 2C is fine for occasional purposes.

Redmi Earbuds 2C doesn‚Äôt deliver a good range of frequency when listening to music and you may not get a clear audio experience. If you are a music lover then this product might not be made for you.

Gaming Latency:

The Redmi Earbuds 2C works well when watching YouTube videos or movies on external video players. Well, Audio-video sync is fine for normal users.

But if you are a gamer then these earbuds are not for you. You may not find the up to the mark in terms of audio and video delay. When you are playing high-end games then you find some audio delay and it is considered as the biggest issue for gamers.

Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Good build quality
DSP ENC
Stylish and fashionable design
Voice assistant and IPX4 rating
Good audio performance
Cheap price

Cons:
No-touch control
Volume cannot be controlled with the earbuds button
You can‚Äôt change tracks with the earbuds button
The clarity of the sound is average
No charging cable in the box
Micro USB port for charging
For office meetings / calls over WebEx / Zoom, I do not recommend them at all as they don't deliver good
connectivity and clarity.

Conclusion:

If your budget is strictly under 1500 rupees then you can consider it however there are other option also. I would suggest you to look for brands also like Boat, Noise, Play etc. If you can extend you budget to 2000 or little more then you can get far better options.

It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don‚Äôt want a ‚Äúrepaired tag‚Äù in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can‚Äôt demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don‚Äôt know what Apple is going to do.

Cons-

‚Ä¢ MATTE Finish- The Case &The Ear buds have Matte Finish on their plastic, which is GOOD TO LOOK. But it tends to be slippery, I mean once, I had a hard time taking them off the charging case(can blame dry hands too)

Overall, They are just FINE.
I bought these for my dad for his daily music needs and a lot of hands free calls. He liked them.

Fragile to handle.The back-end support is not stable.It takes the precision of a surgeon to main the paper in the exact position so as to be picked up my the roller to print. Print speed is too slow. If you want to print 50 pages or so , dedicate half day of yours for that. Waste of time and money. Returning it in the first 3 hours.",1

My phone has no heating issue or camera issue or whatever issue these guys have mentioned in reviews. All over a great deal.

259,Amazing headphones at 599/-,"Review after one month of continuous usage - Very good as compared to other company's headphone in a similar price range (like Sony's MDR-ZX110A and JBL's C300Si). Bass is super good. Sound quality is awesome too. A bit of sound leak when listening to high volumes. noise cancellation is also good ( not very awesome) for at least this price range.
they feel somewhat tight for starting a few days but then loosen up in a couple of days. chord quality is good and the 3.5 mm jack is covered with nice protetion too. mic works fine too.
Overall very good if you get it under 650 (i got it for 599 :p)!!!",5
1246,Expected more ... but...,"The product is a budget product , but can't we expect more from Mi..
Pros .
The device is light weight . You plug it and forget ..
As a daily driver it works for a day long if you are not having music / so much calls..

Assistant works nicely. You can call someone while driving / walking, when you are too far from device easily.

You can use the device in two phones .. left with one phone and right with other .. ie. You can give one to your wife / or any other family members to office .. and keep one ear pice with you..

The Sound quality is ok. Bass part is loud enough.
Noice cancellation is ok. You can't hear someone is talking near you when both the earbuds are in. This is also an issue when you are walking out with it in ear you can't hear vehicle sound or someone speaking to you in road..

The pairing and connectivity having no issues till. It is ok with some seconds delay... paring both the sets having no issues..

Cons:
Eventhough sound quality is ok and having enough bass ... you can't have a musical enthusiasm on this device. The sound become mix up.. and crapy when it's loud.

Call quality I put in cons because sometimes the person in the other end having some issues .. not all times .. especially when the call begins. But the problem is not aall time event.

Gaming : I bought this product to use for gaming. But it's not worthy for that , During PUBG game play the sound feedback we are getting is ok when it's in low letancy mode. But the game become lag at certain situations. "" It's not that much prominent when I'm playing it with wiredearphones ..

Last but not least .. I'm having an issue that when I connect this device to my PC and some other device having stock android, when ever a sound occurred the volume menu is appearing .. is this a device issue or something like that. So I'm trying to replace this one .",3

Over all u get upto 5 to 6 hrs of battery backup at 1 charge for normal calls, video calls, music with partial usage at 50 % volume level.

2076,Great iPhone,"After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage -
Pros
1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user.
2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps.
3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced.
4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen.
5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone.

Cons
1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided.
2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors.

Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone.",5

160,Proper product details,"Day 1 of using this product : good design and looks, the 3.5 mm jack is normal, sound quality is good with good bass.
The headphones are somewhat tight on ears, I think with passage of time it will become loose so that is not big issue.
The ear cushions on earpiece is OK.
You cannot wear this headphones continuously for more than 1 or 1.5 hours because your ears will start paining because of tightness.
In terms of sound and bass it is good.
Let's see till what time it functions properly.

Cons.

Verdict:
If you want to invest in premium built quality, privacy and super fluid performance without heating or lagging issues of android, this is a good option.

Still I have to find the way to ""scan"" the printer in the tablet pc even after installing the HP smart app. I don' have much time.

2110,So far so good...(1 week user),"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!

This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:
1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.
2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.
3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.
That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.

I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.

First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.

Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.

User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.

Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.

Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.

Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.

earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.

Overall user experience:
Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.
Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.
Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.
Don‚Äôt worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn‚Äôt you just need to use your passcode so it isn‚Äôt bad. For the most part it‚Äôs quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.
Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.
2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.
3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.

One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.

Hope this review helps next buyer.",4

8201,Great product,"I was in the market to get a monitor for my WFH purpose, to use as a primary monitor and close the laptop monitor.
I was surprised by the built quality, display quality and design. The design is what makes it stand out.The best part of the monitor was the toggle button/selector for the settings of the monitor...Its like the cursor we had in old blackberry phones(Don't exactly know what they are called :p)..
Now coming to display...I have placed it opposite to the window and with sun rays it's pretty much bright enough to work...
The height can not be adjusted but there is little scope of inclination adjustment that can be done.
I would buy the same monitor again when I go for a dual monitor setup.

We placed complaint to HP but no response.

Very poor manufacturing, in all probability these HP laptops are seconds & have manufacturing defects. They are selling them online & washing their hands off.

Not advisable. As a matter of fact we will never buy any HP products in future.",3

2190,Amazing Phone and Superb delivery By Amazon and the seller,"First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.

Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.
The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.
2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.
The Battery backup is decent.
The Sound Quality is nice.
Face recognition is really fast.
Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.
Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.
Hope this helps ! ‚úåüèº",5

The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.

Pros -

- Camera is Amazing
- Water-resistant

- Fluid Smooth touch

- And 100s of more Pros

Cons -

I have got in touch with the seller to hopefully find a solution to this issue and hopefully change the rating of my review if we can find an agreement.

Until then, so many comments about counterfeit cards and I'm starting to believe them myself. I've always have SD cards and never got any problems when it came down to testing the speed and capacity with a slight difference but was alright with it but missing 90MB/s on a card is NOT acceptable at all.

Pros:
1. The sound and mike quality is good. This was the main purpose of buying this headphone.
2. The springs attached at the end of the pin, helps pull out the wire in case it gets pulled. This is really helpful.
3. The cable is pretty long

Cons: None

Small concern: On long usage I experience some discomfort on my ears and have to remove the headset for a while. But it is an indicator how snugly it fits over your ears.

The best one perhaps in this price range.

I am satisfied with battey back-up of the product and the way both buds can be used by two different people by different phones.

Lacks lots of features. Existing features are also removed such as Camera shutter. Sync to third party (Google Fit) is severely broken. Firstly, when syncing sleep data it will ERASE YOUR OLD SLEEP DATA. It keeps syncing weight data even though its completely unnecessary. Which messes with data that you may manually log. It DOES NOT sync blood pressure data. Heart Rate sync is also not synced properly as there are lots of gaps in the data. It doesn't auto sync with Google Fit. The watch / bands are good, but the software is absolutely horrific. The UI sucks and feels bloatly and clumbersome. Worst software ever. Cloud dial is still not available in Boat Storm v6 firmware.",2
2303,An apple for everyone. üçé,"At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.
FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:
Cons
1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.
2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.
3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.
4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.
5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.
6. This phone is heavy.
7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. üòâü§´
You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.
Pros
1. Battery backup is super in my usage.
2. Camera's were as hyped.
3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.
4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.
5. IP68 rating a must have.

If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.",4

In terms of usability features are more in this e.g. display bit depth of 8 bits, multi connectivity options (VGA, HDMI, DVI, Audio Out Ports), 4 split screen functionality, 178 degree viewing angle etc.

Do note that the split screen functionality being LG software driven the multi sub screens cannot be detected in the VDI/Horizon clients (corporate software for remote access). But for home use it's a good feature as you can open reference sites, documents in the split windows within the screen to refer to while working on your primary laptop screen.

Multi ports make sense e.g. as in my T430 laptop I have a display port, and DVI port, there is no HDMI. So with display port adaptor I am able to connect to this monitor using HDMI cable and while other with DVI and end result I have two screens connected to the laptop

Quite happy with the purchase.",5

92,True pure bass headphones!,"It's been a day since I've got this product.

Why i liked these headphone?

First of all, the sound quality is just amazing. I'm not gonna elaborate on this since these are just perfect.

Secondly, if you're not a bass head then you would hate these! Cause these are true bass heavy headphones, take my word on that.

Conclusion, if you are running low on budget and want to grab a good pair of over ear headphones then go for these.
Luckily I got this 500 on the sale day which is awesome! Enjoy the music.",5

Good sound clarity, Hi-quality product, Good fit for ears and head,soft pads,good bass, thicker wire and good AUX, spring in AUX is good for long life of item, highly attractive design. Easy returns and refunds.
AMAZON SERVICES ARE VERY GOOD AND SATISFIED.(NOT PRODUCTS).
Negatives:
This item not for long use ,when we use long time get start pain in our ears. Hi lose of battery persentage in mobiles. 'L'-shaped AUX is always good for mobiles.We can't use heardphone while laying on the bed,it is most difficult for sleeping, Not the item goes to little brother's hand next day he gives you two one-sided headphones.

3085,Above average,"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have.",4

1269,Value-for-money,"It was worthy Buying. Build quality of charging case & buds are found good. It is very light weighted and fitted inside ear easily. Prompt pairing having Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and strong connection without any dropping issue within the connectivity range of 10 meters. Buds battery lasts for near about 3 hrs at 100% volume on single charge and Buds can be charged 3 times out of the backup of Charging case. A single Bud can also be worked with mono mode and lifting other bud from the charging case it will turn into Stereo mode. As the buds are well fitted in the ears and the volume is sufficiently good external noise is nicely reduced, even if it has no active noise cancellation. Vocals and Bass is excellent justifying the price segment and didn‚Äôt find any latency while watching videos on OTT platform.
However, considering other utility features, it is simply price worthy.",5
19017,Not good,Average,2
1318,Literal good for the price,"I mean like it is everything that you would get in 1800/- think of a product with a almost good audio quality and better features of tws! The calls work fine and the music is good!
The best thing I like here is the auto-turn off thing you place them back in the box close the lid and boom disconnected!
Also the one piece at a time feature is good too!
The handling of the ear piece like taking it out part only seems a bit diff! Because of the desing but other than it's cool!
The connectivity with each other is impressive here in this budget!
Also the latency! Like idk abt others but I feel that the buds are pretty good with handling that.
The countdown timer in cod or pubg works exactly with the sound and i kind of like it.",5

22031,Value-for-money,"I got this for 2000. It's better than xlporer because the only new thing given there is GPS anf extra 1000 or 500(usual price) for it and there is no notification of social media on it. The watch is the most popular and best one in this price range. The body is classy and the belt is very nice and non sticky. You get different colour too. The display is okay in this range. The sensor are correct to large extent. I checked the BP and SpO2 in the machines and there is only slight difference in it, so it's very helpful in quick times. In this price the sensors and their functions are to the mark. The strap is very good material and looks shiny. The dial is variable and you can change to your own wallpaper. The functions are very nice in this. Tracking is somewhat correct almost. The vibration is nice. The features are very advanced in this price. You get music control too so that's great really. The screen touch is good and not very sensitive. The relax mode is a good feature here. The app pro gear needs to fix some bugs, and the connectivity issues should be fixed by the app or else everything is good. I have used it for more than 10 days now and the batter is still there. So it depends on your usage. Battery is okay as you can easily use. The brightness level decrease will save much of your battery. It looks good and is handy too. Go for it, you won't get these many features on this price guys now yoy can change the strap too.",4

1086,Excellent offerings at a very competitive price!,"I had ordered these on launch day itself and received the delivery within a day. Since then I have tested it extensively and you should gear in for a fairly long review about every detailed aspect of it.
1. Look and Feel:
The case of the Redmi Earbuds S has a curved rectangle design with a matte black finish. Redmi branding is on the top of the case and in the side panel hosts a MicroUSB port. Overall, the case looks bit bulky but is light weighted and easy to carry.
Earbuds look like pebbles and have an in-ear design which fit snugly inside the ear canal and are quite different from Mi wireless Earphones 2 or Realme Buds Air Neo. The buds have a physical button on top of them to initiate different actions. They are comfortable to wear and carry if you choose the ear tip as per the size of your ear canal from the set of three provided in the box.
Earbuds have an LED under the surface too, which blinks only when charging when ready to pair and not noticeable.
2. Features:
The Redmi Earbuds S come with IPX4-rating and helps it in surviving in drizzle and sweat during the workout. It support Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and has 7.2mm drivers.
Earbuds S have a low-latency gaming mode which is quite handy while watching videos or movies. I tried playing PubG using the low latency mode and felt that the output was pretty decent but it cannot match the wired headphones quality.
3. Controls:
Redmi Earbuds comes with multi-function physical button which is easy to use and click sound it produced when pressed is pleasing to hear. As far as the actions are concerned, a single click will allow you to answer a call or to hang up at the end and a long press will reject the call. Clicking at any other time will play or pause audio or video. If you click twice preferred voice assistant on your device will be launched. In my case, Google assistant was summoned and I used it for managing volume, changing track inside the music app and asking a few relevant questions to keep Assistant busy. I also had the choice of selecting Alexa which should also work fine.
4. Sound Quality:
Since the earphones have an in-ear design, I was very pleased with the bass response. Vocals were decent at around 80 percent volume but anything above resulted in a slight deterioration of the sound quality. Audio quality during calls was good for me, with no complaints from the recipient side as well. I did not encounter any call drops within the 10-meter range beyond which I heard a click sound and audio dropped off as it was out of range.
5. Battery Performance:
I have not yet extensively tested the battery but on a full charge, I was able to watch a 3.5 hours movie with still some juice left. Redmi claims that one can get 4 hours on a single charge and with the case, one can easily get about 10-12 hours. When I charged the case it took around two hours to charge completely.
Final Verdict:
Redmi Earbuds S are one of the cheapest Buds out there in The Market. Redmi has used micro USB port and Physical button to reduce the cost of TWS but I felt Touch button is much better than the touch interface. The performance of Redmi Earbuds will not disappoint you and in-ear design is a good differentiating factor to have to stand away from the rest of the earbuds. Also the sound quality with a thumping bass alongwith very good battery backup for a TWS earbuds are right up there in the positives list. So I would suggest you to definitely go for them without any second thoughts.",5

The joystick controls seems good and new , although I felt a bit low on its sturdy and fast movement. This monitor is not completely bezel-less but the overall looks are quite pretty and the thin bezels are not that bad at all.

On screen control software is also helpful you can keep upto 8 windows easily using that on screen control software.

25,Editing this review after 10 months. üéß,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro's

So the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.

Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.

Now the cons

even though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...

I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.
Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.

Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.
Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above.",4

Seldom while using both together, using single will definitely lag occasionally.

202,"Best in this range, review after usage of almost 2 years","I bought these headphones back in June 2019. And I must say I didn't expect this much at this price.

First of all, the headphones look retro, this is what I like a lot.

Sound quality is AMAZING, again, AMAZING. The mids, highs are all amazingly balanced. The bass is not too overpowering to destroy the vocals. it's just perfect. Now it's been almost 2 years, the earcups are wearing out, but the headphones still sound great. They're very durable. After 1.5 years of use, I'm starting to hear some creaking noises, but it's fine. The jack is amazing too, has a spring so the wire does break there. It's not gold plated, but in real life usage, it doesn't make any big difference. The PVC material cable is tangle free. Everything is good. Just one problem: Comfort

Now don't get me wrong. You can use these for an hour, but after that it may start hurting your ears. just put them in your neck for 2 minutes, then wear again.

Mine haven't broken yet and are still working, but I they break I'll buy them again.

Sound quality: 5/5
Bass quality: 5/5
Durability: 5/5
Comfort: 4/5",5

9199,Hiii,"Alright. So, I ordered this speaker mainly because of its Bluetooth connectivity as my old Sony 4.1 lacks that particular feature and if I want to listen to some music from my phone in that speaker, I would have to physically connect it and then changing the songs when needed is a hassle. So, I was looking for a speaker at comparatively lower price that wouldn't compromise the sound quality. I usually buy speakers after at least listening to its sound in a shop, but this time I gave it a chance and trusted those many reviewers who said this is the best budget speaker with good enough sound quality and good enough bass. Well, I was kind of taken aback after seeing the actual woofer size. It was smaller than I expected and physical size does matter when it comes to bass and hence the bass is not solid enough. Now, don't misinterpret. It's a pretty thumpy bass and it doesn't cracks, but still it somehow lacks the solidity that I have heard in some other speakers. Clarity is really good, both over Aux and bluetooth. When it comes to the total loudness, it's not very loud really. Good enough for a medium sized room, but even with full volume at the speaker level and on the device, it won't blow your roof away...far from it. On the positive side, even at maximum volume the sound doesn't degrade and retains its quality. With bluetooth the sound loudness is at 90% that of what you get with Aux. The bass also goes down a bit with bluetooth. The bluetooth connectivity is awesome, instant, quality is good and doesn't have any noticeable delay(which I was worried about). As a result, I decided to use this speaker with my TV(over bluetooth) and I would keep my Sony for listening to music. By the way, the best part is the remote, it has many functions and the most usable are your ability to control sound level at each and every speaker and the woofer.

Edit : I want to add few points regarding the remote control. I found it bit hard to set up the FM channels. At first I didn't find the auto scan channel option. There is a scan button, but on pressing it, nothing happened(Later I found out from the manual you have to press it for 2-3 seconds to get it working). So, I had to manually tune and find each channel by using tune+ - buttons. And then it was really tricky to save those channels once you find it. On pressing the Save button, it always tries to save them under Channel 01, and changing the name is a bit tricky, I am sure you will figure it out. The good thing is, you can directly type in any channel frequency number from the numeric keypad on the remote. So, in FM mode if you type 938, it will take you to 93.8 FM channel. That's good. The only downside to this remote control is, it has no mute option. In the manual it says, the REPEAT button will function as Mute, but it doesn't work.",5

1) Call quality is poor, u always get some sort of chipping noise or an absurd background noise on other side.... 5 out of 10 times Other end person can't even hear u clearly, u have to speak much louder then normal.
2) Battery issue. It discharged very quickly, like 95% to 30% in 22-25 mins usage which is very opposite to what they claim of.
3) some times these earbud adjust volume of your device as per there own without even touching it.

Cons:
- audio quality is below than average
- multi functional button cannot be used to increase or decrease volumes and cannot switch to next music track.
- buttons are little harder to press
- no noise cancellation
- overpriced ( could be somewhere 1000 rs )

6009,Refrain from buying this product!!!,"Just put it in, no formatting. As the Htc 10 is great for music even 24 bit music and films it was a strong temptation. I also got the 128 gb extreme a2 which I had no problems with. Though the Htc 10 reads the card storage a little higher it is not a problem. A2 is a new technology made by sandisk and western digital. You can buy cheaper but you get limited use and eventually the card loses the ability to write onto or be formatted, though leaving it as unencrpted on the Htc 10.

Though many people use online music but off line music, films and books is nice to have. Also I use extreme cards in my car cams and they are still working after months of use.",1

I have used it for almost 7 months.
A month before the left side of this headphone stopped working. I raised a complaint on boat official website. They took it very seriously and picked up my headphone on same day.
Just because it was in warranty period they exchanged it with a new one and sent to me. It took almost 2 weeks.
The service of boat is cutting edge. I never seen such a beautiful service from a headphone making company.

If you want a quality and service both. You should definitely go for boat products.

Get plugged into nirvana.

98,Good sounding but bad build quality.,"Used it for a few months now. Good pair in terms of sound quality. Since the earcups' outer part is made up of iron, the paint on it quickly wears off and rust begins to form.
It definitely does not look good after that. It began rusting after 3-4 months but the sound quality is still exception at this price point. The cable is long and durable. Tried to use it during online call but the persons on the other end complain that my voice is low and inaudible during most occasions (began happening after 2 months)

Then I have to manually remove page from printer.2. Unpleasant noise : - printer makes a unpleasant noise while printing. It gives feeling that the printer has been damaged. First time I was scared by this noise.3. Poor quality of print : - the quality of print is not at all good. This is a ink printer.4. Costly cartilage : - they are must expensive black cost 800 and colour cost 1000.then don't work even 1 month properly.Note : - don't buy this printer.you should buy the new generations printer this is very costly and not effective.BELIEVE ME.,2

You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1
2390,Engineered to perfection.,"10 months ago
i've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone",4

Every time you sync, all set functions( alerts, notifications) are rest to factory setting.
Each time you sync, data from watch is disappeared.

There are multiple reviews to upgrade the app.
Boat need to seriously look at those and remove bugs.

4151,Great speeds upto 20MBPS during copying(+has type c port),This USB drive is great value for money offering 64 GB storage with USB 3.0 support and type c port providing compatibility with new phones with type c with out the need for a dongle. The write speeds are quite good with up to 20 MBPS and read speeds are also good although I did not test it fully. All in all its a good for anyone who need a new 64 GB thumb drive.,5

22021,Value-for-money,"I got this for 2000. It's better than xlporer because the only new thing given there is GPS anf extra 1000 or 500(usual price) for it and there is no notification of social media on it. The watch is the most popular and best one in this price range. The body is classy and the belt is very nice and non sticky. You get different colour too. The display is okay in this range. The sensor are correct to large extent. I checked the BP and SpO2 in the machines and there is only slight difference in it, so it's very helpful in quick times. In this price the sensors and their functions are to the mark. The strap is very good material and looks shiny. The dial is variable and you can change to your own wallpaper. The functions are very nice in this. Tracking is somewhat correct almost. The vibration is nice. The features are very advanced in this price. You get music control too so that's great really. The screen touch is good and not very sensitive. The relax mode is a good feature here. The app pro gear needs to fix some bugs, and the connectivity issues should be fixed by the app or else everything is good. I have used it for more than 10 days now and the batter is still there. So it depends on your usage. Battery is okay as you can easily use. The brightness level decrease will save much of your battery. It looks good and is handy too. Go for it, you won't get these many features on this price guys now yoy can change the strap too.",4

1098,Value for money,"Overall nice product for the price. Form factor is great as it is small and light weight. Matt finish looks great on the earphones and the case. Comes with 3 different size of eartips, so easy to find your fit.
Sound quality is alright. Not very good as can be expected at this price point. So these are not the best choice to enjoy your music. Convenience is its greatest advantage as you can pop the earbuds in your ear wherever and whenever. I think these are best for watching videos, playing games and using during workouts.
Calling experience is ok. The mic is not the best but it gets the job done as the other party can hear you with this clearly without any issues. Conveniently especially during long calls as you do not have to hold your phone to your ears.
Connectivity could be better. Despite this being a bluetooth 5 device, it connects to 1 device at a time. This is cumbersome as if you need to connect your phone and this earbud automatically pairs with your laptop, for example on coming out of the case, you either need to disconnect the earbud from your laptop manually or reset the earbud which takes around 20 sec everytime. Sometimes it lags while playing a video and sometimes it disconnects itself but those are not major issues.

1224,Less than average product !,"I would sum up this product in few points:

1. The bass is poor and it is acceptable because this is a wireless earbud.

2. It picks up external noise way too heavily and you won't be able to use it when your TV is on or some noisy fan is on. The person hearing you on the other side will hear a lot of noise.

3. There is no active noise cancellation and passive cancellation is useless. So you would find a wired headset performing far better than this.

4. The connectivity is average and the pairing time is decent.",2
6321,High Noise,"Writing the review after 2 years of usage.

1106,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAYS FOR !!!,"First of all, I don't write reviews to convince people to buy products. I just brought this product a week ago and I'm sharing my experiences through this review. You can decide to buy this product or not but that's all up to you. why I'm writing this review is to help you with your purchase decision. so let's break it down:

1. sound quality - good for the price. expect a sound quality from a 400 to 500 rupees wired
earphone.
2. call quality - call quality is not good. for the price it is acceptable. if you are planning to use this
for call in a noisy environment then you have to scream.
3. connectivity - connectivity is ok. after the first pairing it will become very easy to connect with
your phone, the moment you take out the earphones from the charging case it
will immediately connect with your phone. if you cover the earphone with your
hand, while you are listening to the connection, will break but it will reconnect
immediately.
4. Controls - I have a mixed feeling on how this earbud can be controlled. For me using physical
button is way easier because the funny thing is I can use my shoulder to control. the
buttons are easily clickable. but the thing I don't like is ""you cant skip music"" that is
very annoying. We can use the buttons to enable the game mode, play/pause music,
and activate google assistant/Siri.

4. battery life - I don't wanna talk about the company claimed battery life. Let's talk about the
battery life I got. since the day I got this earphone I charged it fully and started
using it. Every day I used it for 1 to 1.45 hours continuously without using the
charging case and I got a complete battery life of 4 days(using case).

conclusion: -
Under this 2000 rupees price range u don't have an alternative. realme buds q is not on a stable price
and sells for 2300 to 2400 price range. if u can get one under 2000 you can buy one if you want to.
There are many negative reviews on this product I don't know why they are posting this kind of
negative reviews.

28,Awesome sound quality,"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.

I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.

Two things which could have been improved upon are -
1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.
2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used.",5

5970,Low cost but very noisy mixer grinder,"I have seen other reviews on here complaining about the transfer rates on this memory stick. I have purchased (for about ¬£6) a USB3 car reader from Anker and this is giving me the speeds shown, its about 80B/s write and about 90 read, so not as fast on read as what is suggested, but that is still very acceptable. Please note that a number of factors come into play when using storage like this. The CPU will do a lot of the work, so will need a good CPU to see full speeds, also the drive being transferred from or to needs to support the speeds you want to see. In my case, I am seeing these speeds from both mechanical drives and NVMe drive in my PC.

With regards to space, please understand what a GB is, its 1000,000,000 bytes, where as a GiB is 1,073,741,824 bytes, so, for example, to work out the space you are buying, if you buy 128GB, or 128,000,000,000 bytes (it states this on the packaging too), you divide that number by 1024 3 times and it will show you how many GiB you end up with. I get 119GiB which = 128GB. 238GiB=256GB and 372GiB=400GB. Please ensure you understand space calculations before you complain that what you purchased does not match up to what is shown in Windows. The space shown on the packaging is actually correct (giga = billion, gibi is based on the 1024 calculation of space used by computers and this is acutally what windows shows).

I will look at getting more of these as required in the future, using this one in my drone for 4K video recording",3

3100,Overall a Good product at the price of 3K,"On time delivery by Amazon. Print quality is GOOD, on par with any other printer at this price range. But canon mg2570s & mg2577s are cheaper & comes with cheaper cartridges (something I observed).
It takes some time for the Scanning & printing process but thats normal for home use & even OK for small home business uses. The lid hinge looks & feels quite flimsy though.
Installation process was hassle free. Online Registration was swift. Hp's app is super easy to use just uninstall the bloatware ;)
Refill cartridge is some what expensive but thats inevitable with any inkjet printer (no point in blaming only hp for that) but canon's 745s black & 746s color cartridges are relatively cheaper, (around 200/- less)

5925,Worst Item Don't Buy,"Die Karte ist auf der Verpackung mit 160 MB/s Lesen und 90MB/s Schreiben angegeben.
Beim mehrfachem Kopieren verschieden gro√üer Dateien 2-12GB kam ich zwar beim Schreiben unter Windows 10, exFAT und NTFS bis zu 80MB/s was ich voll akzeptiert h√§tte, aber das Lesen war nur halb so schnell wie beworben. Ich hatte die Karte vorallem wegen den angepriesenen 160 MB/s Leserate gekauft und 35 Euro mehr als f√ºr die mit 90MB/s Lesegeschwindigkeit angegebene SanDisk Extreme gleicher Kapazit√§t gezahlt.
Vom Stuhl gefallen bin ich dann bei den 4K Schreib/Lese Datenraten.
Egal welches Tool ich verwendet habe kamen hier nicht mehr als 2,5 MB/s Schreiben (4k) raus bei ca. max 420 IO/s.
Hier die f√ºr SD Karten definierten Specs:
U1/U3: Diese Zahl dr√ºckt das Schreibtempo einer SD-Karte mit UHS-I- oder UHS-II-Technik aus.
U1 steht f√ºr 10 MBps, U3 f√ºr 30 MBps.
V6-V90: Das ist eine Schreibtempoangabe f√ºr Videoaufnahmen. Die Spanne reicht von 6 bis 90 MBps.
A1/A2: Bei diesen Geschwindigkeitsangaben schafft die Karte eine bestimmte Anzahl von Zugriffen pro Sekunde (A1: 1.500 beim Lesen, 500 beim Schreiben; A2: 4.000 beim Lesen, 2.000 beim Schreiben).

Die f√ºr die SanDisk Extreme 400G angegeben Werte wie U1 und V30 schafft sie nat√ºrlich locker.
Die Angebe A2: schafft sie aber nach meinen Messungen um Faktor 3-4 NICHT! ( siehe Screen Shot)
Die Karte schaft nicht einmal die A1 Einstufung!

Ich finde es hilft auch nicht auf der R√ºckseite mit nur mit der Lupe lesbar zu schreiben, dass man um 160MB/s zu erreichen ein passendes Device ben√∂tigt. Aber was das f√ºr ein ""device"" denn sein soll bleibt v√∂llig im Unklaren.
Nach genauerem Web-Studium fand ich heraus, dass das Karteninterface UHS-I sowieso nur max. 105 MB/s kann.
Die 160 MB/s sind nur mit einem UHS-2 Karteninterface m√∂glich, dass die Karte ja gar nicht hat, oder vielleicht doch?
Ich hab mir jetzt von SanDisk den UHS-2 USB-C Reader bestellt und werde das mal interesse halber pr√ºfen.

Die Zahlen auf der Verpackung sind jedenfalls reines Marketing.
Die Karte funtioniert in Photokameras bestimmt ganz gut auch beim Filmen mit 4K Aufl√∂sung.
Meine Canon M50 schreibt mit max. 150 Mbit/s bei 4 k Video.
Ich habe auch die Serienbildfunktion der M50 mit large JPG und paralleler large RAW Speicherung getestet.
Nach ein paar Sekunden f√§ngt die Kamera an zu stottern und mu√ü erst ihren Buffer wegschreiben.
Meine 2 Jahre alte ADATA SDXC KArte die nur mit 45MB/s Write angegeben ist verh√§lt sich √ºbrigens identisch.
Also auch hier kein Praxisvorteil.
Zum Vergleich, die SanDisk ""Ultra"" kostet bei gleicher Kapazit√§t 35,- Euro weniger, die tuts auch f√ºr die Kamera.
Und selbst meine 2 Jahre alte ADATA verh√§lt sich mit der nagelneuen Canon M50 gleich.
Spart euch das Geld f√ºr eine schnelle SD Karte!
Die Kameras, Laptops und Mobilphones brauchen erst einmal das schnelle UHS-2 Interface,
und momenten eher selten zu finden.",1

2086,Read this before switching from Android,"If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:
1. Video recording doesnt have pause button
2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer
3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.
4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings
5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item
6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.
7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls
8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.
9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect
10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.
11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones
12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk
13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha
14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper
15. No battery % on the notification bar
16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.
17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.
18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.
19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?

Sound: 10/10. The sound quality of this headphone is amazing and on par with many expensive ones. Bass is amazing, it feels very natural. Lows, highs, mids and vocals are perfectly balanced. It is great for playing games as well.

Durability: 10/10. The wire of the headphone is very thick and tangle free. I have dropped it a few times from my bed and there isn't any visible damage or scratches.

Comfort: 7.5/10. When continuously using for 3-4 hours you may feel a little pain on your ears because of the pads. But I think that's a general issue with budget headphones. Also you can't run around wearing these. It is quite uncomfortable to do so.

Mic: 6/10. The mic is actually below average. There is no noise cancellation. My mic sometimes doesn't even work(I have this issue for the past 2-3 months). However other headphones in this budget don't even offer a mic, and others which do have sh*t audio and build quality. So I think it's a restriction to these budget gadgets. You can't expect everything at this price.

Overall I feel if the mic doesn't really bother you, then just go for it. Otherwise invest some more money and get the basshead 450 or 510. Or you can wait for the big sales as they recieve a discount of 300 and 500 respectively.",5

I was worry about product quality nd delivery because lots of negative reviews seen on YouTube nd also in this platform.
Some people claimed that they received fake products or defective products so I was also lill bit tense .
I placed this order dated 19.01.21 nd got my iphone 11 22nd morning , for precaution I done recording delivery process nd unboxing too .
Now I can say that people shouldn't doubt on Amazon and their products which they deliver.
My primary phone is iPhone 12 Pro Max nd this one is my secondary phone because it's size matters for me , very handy 6.1 inch screen size so it's comfortable to use single hand .
Quality is best , battery life 100% nd camera quality is also becnchmark of this segment.

Quality of the volume dropper miserably. My phone's speaker was doing a better job that the boAt Stone 190.

Very disappointed with the product.",2
11969,Did not meet expectations,Sound is awesome.. quality not good,1
1073,For the price they are good pair of TWS..read my detailed review and decide,"Detailed review:

Build: The build is very good .The buds feel of good quality.Buttons are tactile.The box could have been made better.

Design: The design is good but for some reason I was not able to wear it continuously for more than 1 hr straight.Also for better audio experience try using a size less eartip if you can for better experience.

Audio: This is a mixed bag.The audio quality is great compared to the price.8/10 but bass is where the things are not so great.The earphones have bass but not the thumping bass.Also if by chance you did not wear it properly you won't even feel the bass.Loudness is good not great.100% here equals 80% of other earphones.But as they are TWS it's acceptable

Calls: The call quality is great.I have had no complaints while receiving or taking calls.The ENC feature is a misfit though..it captures outer sounds more instead of cancelling them..so not sure of the call experience in heavy traffic

Battery: Battery life is great as compared to the price

Clarification: I read some comments and here are some tips:

1) Audio in only 1 earbud: The TWS is designed to be on mini 1 ear mode on boot.If you want stereo both ear then press the button on the bud and it will pair together.Audio in both buds then.

2) Can't charge them: Make sure you remove all the tapes before using the product.

This is an original product.You can scratch the code and verify it on mi website.Its a 20 digit code which signifies authenticity

Cons: Most of the features wrt price are good.Here are some cons-
1) Most imp no charging cord provided in the box.
This charges via micro usb and now all phones are type c.Maybe you won't have micro usb.Hence cord should be bundled

2)Actions on clicking buttons are inconsistent , sometimes calls don't disconnect,songs don't pause,etc

3) No proper app to control the buds

4) No firmware updates

5) Packaging is very cheap.They feel some 100 rs earphones.Need to work on packaging.",4

2078,"Great phone , Very tough exchange process","PROS :
1. Excellent phone with sleek screen
2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day
3. Face recognition is smooth
CONS:
1. Just the exchange process is very very complex
If you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps

1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange
2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away
3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number.
4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same.
5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone.
6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email.
7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device.
8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away.
9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT.
10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service.
I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone.

Night mode of camera is impressive as expected.
Os is smooth.
I was reluctant about experience before purchase but it turned out good decision.

First day experience lot of heat in back panel but looks like initial setup involved lot of activities that could be reason, after turning radios like data and Bluetooth as needed , it got resolved , in general usage there is no heat problem.

7079,Outstanding DSLR for beginners!,"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..

Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )

Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )

Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)

Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)

Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.
You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)

Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.

So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!
Overall rating 9/10.

(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)

Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.

3087,Never go for Hp inkjet printers.,"Giving review after 3 months view..

Never ever in ur life ,even if by mistake dont think about buying this inkjet or deskjet type printers of Hp.Hp is chinese.and we know china and chinamall.
I dont know about ink tank printers but yes this type of inkjet is a total waste of ur money and time.

My hp 2131 printer lasted around 3 months only with so many messy things ,
Printed 40 pictures with the demo catridges.
Next 300 pages with refilled ink of good quality.
Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers.",1

2499,Great value for money,"it was just an awesome purchase for me, because this is the handset which iam looking for ever since it was launched, the only thin that bothers me was its hefty pricing, but fortunately with this amazon's great indian festival off, i could able to buy it in my budget price, since iam an iphone user i dont have anything to say about its features and specs, the thing is, if anyone wants to upgrade their mobile and who uses it for a quiet bit longer years then they should definitely go for this device without any doubt.",5

For gaming it's the best ips panel under 10 k. Don't go for 24 inch gaming monitors for extra 3k just to get 2 inch extra. There is some minor bleeding is here, but as for the price it's a great value monitor. Even some high end monitors suffers bleeding issues.",5

I purchased the phone and it was delivered to me the very next day. I opened the box with lots of doubts, but all my doubts turned into smile when I switched on my phone, it works brilliantly and I didn‚Äôt have any trouble.. the phone is amazing and I just love it.. I made the right choice. Only disappointment I had was the box doesn‚Äôt come with an charger adapter. Otherwise the phone is just amazing.",5

1044,Your call,"Writting this review after 2weeks of moderate use, er... I have discarded my wired earphones and using this daily for atleast 7-8 hours. Does that count as moderate usage ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?

Let me make things clear first, I am no music expert. I won't be talking about highs, lows, mids. And if you're here, it's quite probable that either you've watched reviews on YouTube already or are going to check them out. But not everyone is saying truth there I guess.

Ok, let's start talking on these earbuds.

:Pros:

‚Ä¢ Weight: these are quite light, slightly heavier than regular wired ones. You won't feel any discomfort having them installed in your ear.
‚Ä¢Watching videos offline: you'll have to adjust audio delays. Once done, trust me you won't return to your wired earphones. And adjusting audio delays is quite easy using different media players
‚Ä¢Watching videos online: YouTube videos are good with these. But I have noticed a slight lag watching online videos on browsers
‚Ä¢ Listening to music: My experience was quite good. But the sound was not of the best quality.
‚Ä¢Battery backup: You can watch two movies back to back without charging the buds. So that also worked for me.
‚Ä¢Design: Owing to its lightweight and ergonomic design, it fits very well in ear, and it never fell out of my ear while runnig or cycling.
‚Ä¢Connectivity: Connectivity is good. And I mean good. Provided you are near your phone, within 5-10 meters I guess. After that it starts to break. And let me remind you, 10 meters is 33 feets.

:CONS:

‚Ä¢Case: After using for 2-3 days, buds inside the case start to get loosened. And now you can hear them rattling against the case when you shake it. And sometimes it stops getting charged and instead pairs up with my phone. That's irritating.

‚Ä¢Consistency: These buds are not consistent, not in connectivity, not in battery backups. The above review, if you've read till now, is based on it's performance average.

‚Ä¢Call quality: Now this is the question many people are asking. No you don't deliver a clear voice over phone while receiving call through these, when you are outside. But when you're in home, or in a quiet place, they don't notice dropping of voice. When you're outside you can use one of thee buds as mouthpiece and another as earpiece, that'll do.
‚Ä¢ Guarantee: They don't come with a guarantee, atleast I didn't find any.

So, if you are planning to upgrade from your wired headset, you can certainly go for this. Or maybe you can wait for a better earphone to come. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",4

1. Very handy
2. 12 hours of battery backup
3. Box design
4. 2 sets of extra buds
5. Good bass quality
6. Splash proof
The main advantage is power off and on button on the front side of the earbuds. Usually we will have a fingertouch for other buds. So giving button on that place is the most perfect I can say
And also it is normal USB pin charger and no specific pin is not required to charge it.",5

Although it worked it couldn't keep up with even 1080p recording, let alone 4k, so would freeze every 2 seconds or so. That is obviously no good for a dashcam as the freeze would last around 5 frames and could miss something crucial. 5 frames doesn't sound like much but when travelling at 30 mph or above, 5 frames is a lot. So I ordered this one and it now records effortlessly in 1080p AND 4k without a problem! Happy dappy days :)",1

Audio output isn't extraordinary but no one will wire up headphones to it anyways. A very good 1080p monitor with a pleasing look.

By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don‚Äôt feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price. If you are looking for a over the ear headphones and for a good price.... this is your choice.",5

cons:
1. my ear (top part) starts paining if i continously use it for 2 hrs, due to small sized puffs
2.High volume or loud sound is transparent which makes the other person hear what you are hearing .

2148,Iphone vs One plus,"Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucks
Camera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the best
Face recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.
Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.
Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phones
Build quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.
No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.
Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?
P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.",4

6043,Low grade plastic.,"I bought this card to use with a gopro. I had bought a Kingston card but found after 17mins the camera stopped recording. I researched the read/write speeds and identified this card should fit the bill. So far, I have not been disappointed. The first time I used the card my GoPro ran for 4hours (With an external battery) and the card performed as it should with out any issues what so ever. Having used it twice now for long file recordings and every time faultlessly. If I needed an additional card, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. Added to I received speedy service and delivery.

4118,Not a great build quality but does the job well,"I have used other SanDisk USB drives in past but with this one I felt the build quality could be better for ‚Çπ899.
I will say that this is not a very great design and the usb C connector is not a very great fit, although it fits tightly and there is not any connection loss, it just lacks the great clicky feeling.
I have transferred an 1GB file from my laptop and it gave me around 18-20mbps in usb 2 and usb 3 both. Then I transferred the file to my phone and it gave around 25-28mbps.

You will get 58 GB out of 64GB.
Also this thing heats up a bit just after connecting it to pc",3

Bass is really good.
This headphone comes with inbuilt microphone.
Voice is crystal clear whlle using this for calls.
Only negative thing about this headphone is that your ears may start paining if you use it for long time.It is little tight over the ear.But I just bought this a week back only.So may be after few days this may get adjusted with the ear.
Overall,I am happy with this awesome headphone :)",5

Sowohl Lese- als auch Schreibgeschwindigkeit liegt bisher √ºber den Werten, mit welchen die Karte beworben wird. Insbesondere die Schreibgeschwindigkeit ist beeindruckend hoch. Gemessen wurde das Ganze am USB3.1 Port mit einem Sandisk USB Adapter. Wie auch bei den Speichermedien anderer Hersteller kann ich feststellen, dass bei gr√∂√üeren Kapazit√§ten die Schreibgeschwindigkeit augenscheinlich h√∂her ist als bei geringen Mediengr√∂√üen.

Ich habe zum Beispiel auch zwei USB 3.1 Sticks von Samsung getestet und auch hier ist der kleine Stick langsamer.

Verwendet wird die Karte in einer Gopro Hero 7 Black f√ºr die Aufzeichnung von 4k/60fps Videodaten. Bisher hat mich die Karte noch nicht in Stich gelassen und, sollte es bei den getesteten Werten bleiben, rechne ich auch nicht damit, dass es mal dazu kommen k√∂nnte.",2

Last but not the least, this is a entry level 750 watt machine, strongly recommend a buy against any Prestige product, especially in which they do not have core comptence. They traditionally have been in pressure cookers and cookware, that is what they are fine with. Mixers/ grinders, chimneys, coffee makers, blenders etc is not Thier competence, a definite avoid for Prestige as a brand in these areas",1

3,Unbiased review,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)
Audio quality 4/5
Bass 3.8/5
Value for money 4/5
Comfort 4/5
Build quality 3.7/5

19599,Moderate,"A basic watch to count your steps. The other measurements are not so accurate. Built quality is ok you have to get a screen guard and still be careful. Battery backup is good have spent 9 days already with morning walks, sleep monitoring, automatic heart rate, 5-6 SpO2 3-4 BP checks with minimal screen time and I still have 22 % battery left. Only 4 watch faces that too are not that attractive. More watch faces were promised via OTA update but not received yet. The price is very attractive and features are on par with price. There is no silent call only reject call. Because of BT 4.2 range is limited if you compare to BT 5. Font used is very basic so notifications are just functional. More work needs to be done on Boat Pro gear app which has a couple of years to catch-up with other watch apps. Boat is new into software so far they have only worked on hardware products. So in all if you are price sensitive and want a smart watch that works this could be your choice.",3

7105,Good for beginners.,"Mine is a I3 11th Gen 256GB SSD Version. Boots up within 6 seconds. Has a great full HD screen so working on documents and reading texts is a breeze. But it is a shiny screen so not an antiglare. Comes with a lifetime version of office so you are covered there. You just need to activate it Camera is good for a laptop considering it is used for video conferencing only and not for clicking selfies or landscapes. Handles multiple tabs in browsers and HD videos smoothly. Wifi connectivity is good, catches signal 2 rooms away. Speakers are loud and clear and upward facing so you wouldn't need external ones for video calls. Battery life is great too. Gets 4 hours with streaming.
2 USB ports are placed next to each other so connecting 2 thick USB drives simultaneously may not be possible. Also got a USB C port for those new age connectors.
Laptop body has a textured surface so maintenance is easy. It is very light so handling is easy. But the keyboard and touchpad could have been better. Keypad feels bit flimsy and childish, touchpad has a wiggle room and not as tight it should be. Hinge is wider and stretches from end to end so should last longer than those old models with 2 split ones that used to break easily. Looks like HP was able to save costs only by compromising on the build as you don't find another laptop with this config in this price. I only hope that the keypad and the hinge last as long as the laptop as I don't see any other weak points in this laptop.
If your usage is limited to your kids online classes, browsing and MS office, just close your eyes and buy this.",4

8196,It's for what it is,"Amazon India DID NOT allow to post my following authentic feedback and rejected on 26.08.2020, trying to post again now.

Dear All, I bought this product on 06.08.2020 (prime day sale) and same was delivered on 10.08.2020.

Am Not a pure techie btw, hence skipping technical aspects of review.. many others have detailed; let's take a cue from them.

BELIEVE ME NOT GIVING IMMEDIATE REVIEWS.

Writing only after 2 months of usage.. that too after expiry of Amazon returns date... so this is genuine.

I experienced following problems.. feel many others reading this would have experienced too.. till this moment of writing this review i find there are 3.8k buyers incl. me... so !.

1. Amazon IN says Included Components for this PC Monitor has "" Monitor, Stand, Power Cord, Connectivity Cables "" - however just received HDMI.. enquired with various stakeholders of team LG India for other cables - sorry only eerie silence received as revert despite escalation; felt no point coordinating with team LG.

If you enquire with Amazon IN, they too do not have this info, just would redirect us to LG. Even if you mention this to LG corporate marketing team, eerie silence would be received as revert.

2. My system configuration is Pentium dual core 2.6Ghz - 64 bit Win 7 Ultimate OS; using D-Sub port for CPU and monitor connectivity. Despite having this config; also compatible with LG Onscreen control dedicated software for its PC video monitors (as per LG India portal), still Onscreen did not work.

3. Spoke umpteen times to various stakeholders of team LG India (incl. Technical trainer and technical team troubleshooter) - sorry i was told this Video PC monitor can be used only for extended viewing say with Laptop - when probed why it was mentioned NO where in LG india (or) Amazon India portal in their product pages - the end result was i was asked to return the monitor for refunds... and a callback supposedly to be received did not happen in last 1.5 months.

4. I challenge most would disbelieve me with this kind of brand LG service; fine with it, as I have documentary proofs. I already wrote to regulatory bodies like NCH and noted it's not worth complaining as you donot receive support despite if you share umpteen proofs and updates... Only time waste !!!.

5. With Onscreen control absence.. am unable to use display Presets and VERY IMPORTANTLY Screen Split has not even worked in last 2 months as it is not available in physical menu. I could not even see now how screen split would be like in my present 22MP68VQ monitor despite 2 months passed.

6. I repeatedly get a command in PC during system boot that my video monitor is not set to 1920*1028.. this is despite we set the resolution rate to 1920*1028 in system.. pc monitor never adjusts to our resolution set on systems.. sadly this 1920*1028 is not available to be set in physical menu and onscreen software is the only go !.

7. I found a twitter user complaining about a LG TV/Monitor (made in China) product becoming defective in 2 years and was asking for replacement... As Country of Origin for this product is China - not sure how long will it sustain; though this product has 3 Year Warranty...

8. Am from Chennai and have in the last 2 months spoken over 2 hours with various stakeholders of LG India team and have sent umpteen mails still as of date even after 2 months only miscommunications, misguidance, contradictory assistance, NO timelines and eerie silence were received as revert from LG India team.

9. Even if you escalate to National consumer helpline, no use as LG does nothing in terms of service as one of its manager went to the extent of even suggested for returning to take refund instead of trouble shooting.

10. LG service engineer spent 1.5 hours trouble shooting the problem on 02.09.2020 and was NOT successful despite he said OSC is an open source application which would run on all OS.

11. The same service engineer called a week later and suggested to check with their inhouse CPU in my place, when we asked for resolution he proved a turncoat saying if it works with their cpu then my OS is an issue, reviewers could note the versions received from team LG India.

12. We wrote to their Senior management and corporate teams with all proofs still nothing happened in past 2 months.

13. Our complaint to NCH & MCA with umpteen proofs went in favour of LG as NCH asked us to approach NCDRC.

End result: if anyone believes brand LG being global their products and service levels would be appreciable, then think twice..

I own almost almost 60k worth of various consumer appliances of LG still I had to face this obnoxious music from LG team india and its local staffs.",5

Good picture quality and matt screen makes this monitor a beast for budget guys and school gammers... There is a separate mode for movie/photo/reading/gaming which is absolutely insane. Just a few clicks and monitor adjusts its brightness and contrast according to the mode. It also adjust its brightness according to the content of display, the more white content will lower the brightness and darker content are displayed with higher brightness and it does this automatically all the time.

Colours are good.
NOTE - It's not edge to edge display as shown in the images. There is a SLIGHT border that gets hidden by the top anti glare layer. But it's not a deal breaker with very thin bezel.

No cons as such, it's just a 9k display. Did not experience bleeding issues or even if it's there, not that prominent to affect my work.

1193,Don't ever buy this pair of TWS!!!,"I'm gonna write an honest review about these pairs of earbuds.
frankly speaking, they're available at a cheap price of 1799/- that's cool, but the problem is that at this price TWS earbuds would always be compromised in quality and Redmi Airdots S makes a great example of that.
I bought these TWS earbuds two times in two weeks. I bought for the first time and I was really disappointed with the quality and sound issues, I thought this was a unit problem and I bought another piece of the same earbuds. Honestly speaking there were no issues with the battery but after continuous 2 hours of usage the sound starts breaking and as it claims 4 hours usage in one go isn't possible as you have to place the earbuds back in the case after 2-hour continuous use to bring it back to normal. Also, there was another incident when the earbuds started making a sound on its own even after being disconnected from the phone.
The low latency mode in these earbuds has no effect at all while gaming.
The case is made of plastic and looks pretty premium at this price bracket, cannot complain about the materials and comfort at this price though.

With more than 40 hours of usage, I came to the conclusion that I should return these earbuds and the chances of them getting deteriorated were pretty high and thus they won't last long. These earbuds have too many problems to be dealt with.

Also, I would suggest everyone not to buy this product, whenever you're getting TWS earbuds at this low prices some of the features would always be compromised. Either you have to invest more to buy a good product or go with the Wireless earphones of the same price ranges.",2

Capacity - 256 GB with pre-installed auto backup software (you can remove that to get that additional 1-2 Gb)
Quality - Plastic (not cheap one, but yes, towards USB A end, its prone to damage and breakage and its very thin).
Speeds - I got 100 mbps transfer rate on USB 3.0 port while copying to USB Portable samsung SSD. While copying bunch of small/os files, its slow.. for larger files, its fast only.
Software - I didnt used the Sandisk Memory Zone software, as it showed me backup up, but there were only folders when checked in PC. So, back to File explorer, and it works. Always Copy and paste (not cut), and backup in PC before deleting from Phone.
Purpose - I used Go-Pro and Nikon Snapbridge to copy files from Cam to Mobile (but still backup in this PD to be safer and clear storage in Mobile.
Deal - Got the 256 GB version in Amazon Sale at only 2200, so its a deal.",5

22048,Really Nice,Watch is too good. But battery indication is not there on Disply. And watch faces are not so much attractive. But in this price range (I got it at Rs2000) its a good watch.,4

8350,Excellent product ever seen!!,Picture quality is better but there is slight sharpening effect comes in when anything moving on the screen you will notice if u see carefully overall is good product at this price it might hurt your eyes if you are not used to bright screens. if u seat closer to monitor its better to keep brightness low. I prefer slightly bigger screen display than just 22 inch may be 24 inch will be really good. If anyone is on budget then this is the better monitor that's why i chose this one.,5

Note - charging cable is USB 2.0 (Not type - C, so it may be a hassle if you are using a type - C smartphone)

Overall a good product, the battery back up is amazing.",4
1048,Scale Changer - Think Before You Buy. - Ratings: 3/5,"Pros:
1. Good Connectivity and easy to switch between devices.
2. Single earbud mode use. However, you cannot pair the other earbud with any other device. The moment it comes out of its case it pairs with the second earbud that is already in use.
3. Ear Fitting is good. Can fit small ears easily.
4. Sound Quality:
a. Bass: 2/5 - Bass is punchier but it does not resonate on the exact scale (note) of the song. So, you will hear bass but won't be able to feel it resonate with your eardrums. It would seem like an additional instrument is being played formally.
b. Mids: 4/5 - The mid is pretty good on this device.
c. Highs/Treble: 3.5/5 - The audio is pretty clear and loud.
d. Noise Cancellation: Very good noise cancellation because of the design and fitting.
5. Battery life: Approximately 3 hours of playback time on medium volume levels.
6. Very Good Call (including mic) quality: The mics are really sensitive. When on call, the caller can even hear your footsteps clear and loud.

Cons:
1. Scale Changer: I am surprised and have never seen this in my life. It changes the scale of the song in between the playback. I don't know the reason but it is horrible. No other earbuds do this. For a musician, this sucks!
2. Jitter/Delay - There is a very small amount of delay in sound being played on screen which may or may not be noticed by you all. Musicians can identify the same easily.
3. Box/case Design - I feel that the case could have been much sleek for carrying it in pockets.
4. Connectivity drop issues when used on Desktop/PC Windows - More often, There is a lag and connection drops continuously when paired and used with Windows PC/Laptop.",3
4314,Best Performance I've ever seen (If you see under 1000 budget),"Well the performance is pretty good but it heats very fast, if you are ok with the heating then it is the best in the market under 1000rs tag price. The Flash Drive itself is very small as compared to the photo uploaded by amazon.
Overall 4.5/5 (-0.5 for getting heated bery fast after 5mins use)",5

2121,The iPhone for everyone!,"Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.
First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up üëç  for that.
Let me talk a little about the phone üì±. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.
‚úÖ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.
‚úÖ All-day battery life.
‚úÖ A great degree of water & dust resistance.
‚úÖ Wireless charging
‚úÖ An extra ultra-wide camera
‚úÖ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)
‚úÖ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.
But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.

A high recommendation for this product.",5

1118,Effective and light weight earbuds but ofcourse low cost implies buggy features,"Used for 3 days and posting review
Pros:
1. Cost
2. Sturdy material for charging case and matte finish
3. Punchier sound is good for indian music
4. Very very light and doesn't give any pain in the ear(i use jaybird run and it is very heavy)
5. Both earbuds are in sync for calls - single earbud can be used for music and calls if other one switches off

Cons:
1. Calls have a lot of disturbance - buggy
2. Sometimes when it is already connected, it still gives pairing sound
3. Sometimes it gets frequent interruptions with sound stopping for every other second
4. Mentioned Low Latency 122ms but still seems to be nearly 350ms
4. No proper charging indication outside the box.

1484,Except bass everything else is too good,Everything is too good except the base. I used these for a day and the sound quality is too good clear and loud enough. Noise cancellation is also good and the battery is as said with minute difference. But if you are a bass lover dont go for it. Call quality is not bad we can hear good but the microphone is average which which makes the opp person unable to hear is unless we talk loud.,4

85,So far Good!!,"I Got the BoAt BassHeads 900 and used it for 2 days so far. Not bad at all for the price. Sound is satisfactory n comfortable on ears. Sound is pretty loud so i keep it on lesser than 50% volume. Mic function works well too when used on video calls on mobile n laptop. Some reviews talk about the headset hurting the ears after long usage but I did not find any issue like that at all. Used it to watch a movie of 2 hrs continuously n no pain at all. Infact very comfortable on ears n soft cushioning. Noise cancellation is also satisfactory. Dont hear much of outside noise nor does sound leaks out to others.
Got it mainly for my son for online classes, he‚Äôs in 4th Std and fits his smaller head perfectly too with no pain or discomfort.
Very sleek look and foldable too which i really like.

1042,One side of ear buds stopped working.,"[changing my review. 3 days past and one side completely dead. No sign of charging, no sound .. nothing. Very common issue by reading other reviews]

I have some high end ear buds and head phones but those all at times can be a little bulky and wearing them for prolong time can cause some pain and uncomfortable around head and ears.

I was searching for some super light Bluetooth ones which I can wear for mostly listening podcast and audio books. I saw these for 1299/- and couldn't wait to give it a try given the weight is just 4gram each.

Here are few good things about these buds -

1. Super light like feather. You may use for hours and still won't feel that you have ear buds on most of time. Great audio for listening books, sleeping meditation, podcast etc.

2. Charge last for good long time. I am sure you won't be able to exahut the battery in single use.

3. Fit well and seems pretty steady in ear for general purpose use.

4. Audio is greay for songs but I don't think they stand next to high end like Bose or Apple airpods etc.

5. Fast and reliable Bluetooth connection but distance is less than 6-7 meters at best if phone and buds aren't in straight line. Too bad if you are in house and moving around while your phone is stationary.

6. Because of their sungness and noise cancellation, they cut out a lot of noise of outside at reasonably high volume.

7. Call quality at the other end will be good and the person on call with you ,will hear you clearly.

What I think could be improved -

1. Phone call quality is good , sound is crisp and clear BUT super low. Even in the maximum volume, it sounds pretty low. Hope it's not the defect of my buds. You can still make call and hear voice but you need to be attentive enough.

2. Case is cheap and not going to last long. I think the top lid will come off soon although it won't break the charging function and pods are magnet attached but it's flimsy and cheap.

3. I wonder if they are meant for rigorous excercises buds. You can surely do some basic lifting and all but anything like lots of movement or speed running etc and I think they will fall out easily.

In nutshell , kind of value money.

If you want something super light , podcast/audio books , meditation purpose and ready to handle it with care then go for it.",1

3069,Print quality is awesome but it's not at all worth !,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

Think well before you buy this printer.",1

8234,A great product at this price range!,"One of the best Monitor price-to-performance +This Review according to My Monitor+
75 hz refresh rate
1 ms response time (it's really grateful for Gaming)
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate increase 75Hz.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Very Beautiful and faithful color representations.
6. All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.

2256,iPhone 11 best iPhone deal,"Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!
Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.
Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..

Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give ‚Äúamazing user experience‚Äù then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..
Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.ü§ò.",5

1111,DON'T buy this. It's a cheap Chinese product,"Got this at price of 1099. Expected to be a good deal. But... The buds were having noise distortion. Also it was having continuous connection disconnection issue. So I went for replacement.

The new piece came. The noise distortion is reduced. I was feeling happy. But within 1 hour of usage, left ear bud just stopped working. I thought that charge might have gone. so I put it in charging case. There are no lights even when connected to case. Left ear bud had gone completely dead. I have a nokia bluetooth headset (mono) which was working for more than 5 years (only battery backup have gone to an hour or so)

So I'm returning it. What if this goes dead after warranty period? I know Xiaomi customer care- they will find thousand reasons not to give warranty. (Like some scratches on body etc.) Also redmi logo is on charging case only and not on earbuds.

This was a cheap Chinese crap. don't buy this guys. Xiaomi once entered indian market providing quality products. Once established, they are now dumping all low quality products into India.

To all those 5 star rating people, maybe they got a good piece, but the two pieces I got were defective. Amazon ratings of this product :- 5star is 36% and 1star is 24% , simply means atleast 20% is defective(both my pieces was defective , so everyone might have replaced it once. Meaning number of defective pieces are doubled )

2065,Beast with a limp,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone‚Äôs features with the cost.
The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a ‚ÄúLiquid Retina display‚Äù; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won‚Äôt notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ‚Çπ, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.
Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.
Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79‚Çπ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase ‚Äúit just works‚Äù really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.
The one feature I wasn‚Äôt too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It‚Äôs safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the ‚Äúsoli‚Äù chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.
One of my favourite is the cameras! It‚Äôs Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won‚Äôt say too much on this topic as it‚Äôs well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.
Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.
I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it‚Äôs hardware.",4

1142,Good for music but not for talking.,"Overall it justifies its price but the main problem lier with its noise cancellation. Forget about the cancellation, it picks up the distant noise so that the other person hears them more than your voice. Very bad at this. Apart from this, like other earpods it doesn't have much music control from its button. You can only pause and play, to change the track you have to operate your phone which is a big time inconvenience while working out. Had I known this earlier I would have returned it.

3038,Costly print- 11 Rs/pg (b/w) & 21 Rs/pg (Clr),"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.
Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.

Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)
Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)
It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.
B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836

B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836
thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)

HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbers
refill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.

Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.
Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.

6052,WORST QUALITY OF PRODUCT AND RUBBISH QUALITY CHECK BY THE MANUFACTURER,"No complaints to share as it does what it is intended to do. I haven't had to worry about it failing so far (now there's tempting fate). It is reasonably fast in modern devices and writes fast enough for the camera body it's in. I can get another shot or two per second with a fast lens compared to slower cards, which is why I bought it.

I would probably buy another (or a more recent Sandisk offering) if I felt the need.",1
341,For general use only,"At this price this product is godd for buying, but the bass boosted hype is false, is is good for general use, but I can say that the sound quality is not very good and bass also not very good, it is good at this price, if you want good quality then you should go for jbl headphones",3

360,Amazing Sound and Bass but...,"The product is really good. Great Audio quality, good bass are some its pros. The noise cancellation, however, is not that good.

However, there are two things that I didn't like about this one. The first is that It is a bit tight out of the box (as most of the reviews tell) and it starts hurting your ears after long usage.
The Second is that the extension part, when extended, is sharp and if you are one of those who tend to put their headphones around their neck when not using, believe me, the sharp edges WILL CAUSE IRRITATION.

Other than that, this is a great deal and you should definitely go for it if the cons aren't big for you.",4

2118,‚ù§Ô∏è Android,"it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.
Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:

> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone
> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.
> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up
> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone
>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.
> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time",2

WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great.

If are buying this camera, stop shooting in auto mode as auto mode is same as a mobile camera so not worth buying of you'll be shooting auto. Buy a point and shoot instead if you'll just be using auto.

Also buy only for photography, Video recording is garbage and you would be better of recording from a mobile camera.

Pros
1. They are strong and sturdy.
2. Excellent for audio calls and mike quality is good as well.
3. Ear pads are nice you can easily keep them on for 3-4 hrs.
4. Audio quality is good per the price range. You've to be practical enough to not compare the quality with the headphones that ranges from 5K and above.

Noise - The machine makes more noise than the actual work it performs.

Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, iOS 14.1, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all. My Phone - iPhoneüôÇ",5
5963,Didn't Even Last For A Day,"I was slightly skeptical at first. I only purchased the SanDisk 400 GB Extreme card after seeing the positive reviews here, along with knowing that Amazon would also be fulfilling the order.

However, I still wanted to be sure that the SD card was legitimate before using it to film 4K H.265 footage.

I tested the SD card using H2testw (v1.4). I used the SD card slot of a Surface Book 2 with a BaseQi SD card adapter. The test results were inline with real world expectations (the computer was also being used for other projects whilst the test was in progress).

I also compared the SanDisk 400 GB Extreme to a SanDisk 64 GB Extreme and SanDisk 128 GB Extreme Pro I had purchased from a reputable local retailer. The fonts and logo all appear to match perfectly and the physical layout of the pins and memory chip match exactly, and the text and serial number layout on the back also match.

The warranty details listed inside the packaging were also for my region and contained correct contact information.

It's fair to say that these cards are genuine and you should be confident in your purchase.

Below are the H2testw results:

5984,Most terrible and disappointing experience of using Prestige mixer grinder.,"So I started by doing a check to make sure it was a 128GB card and not a smaller one mislabelled. (I simply copied a 126GB file to it and compared the hash of that with the original, using HashCalc.) This passed just fine, but I was disappointed that the write speed, for sequential writes to a brand-new card, was only 27MB/s using the supplied micro-SD-to-SD converter.

This seemed odd, so I deleted the supplied partition (which didn't use quite all of the card), made a new one in the Windows-10 Disk Manager and formatted it as exFAT, which gave me a teeny bit more space. After this I got 80MB/s writes.

So, the card seems okay, the format as supplied not so much. But maybe something odd was going on? I'd say test yours and if it's slow kill the partition, make a new simple one and format it as exFAT then see how it goes.

2172,iPhone 11 review,"iPhone11 Review
A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I‚Äôve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.
One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‚Äòpicture in Picture‚Äô in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.
Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.
Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.
Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing ‚Äúcontinuity feature‚Äù that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.
Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.",4

Latency there is still an audio lag in PUBG while playing with moto g5 plus in gaming/latency mode but for movies and stuff they work good.

EDIT: they are very bad after two weeks of use they are creating an irritating problem. Normally you put these buds in case and they start charging but after two weeks they have become loose or something. You have keep adjusting them after putting in box until charging indicator turns on. Although there is magnet that pulls them in the box automatically without doing much effort but it also doesn't work much. You have to set them manually.

Edit 2: they keep on synchronising while listening to anything which makes them very irritating as audio starts cutting in every other second of time period and then you have to shut them down completely and restart again to make them work fine.

Edit 3: they are worst earlier after buying they would work like 3-4 on single charge and now they need charging in every hour.

2538,Best but Amazon ruined it ;(,"Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn‚Äôt quite there at least not for me.
It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn‚Äôt.
To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.
To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won‚Äôt allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!
So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.
It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.
Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.
You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.
The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ‚Çπ3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.
Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.
So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.
And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!",4

2452,Switching from Android to iOS ( And it‚Äôs actually Good ),"I had my doubts before buying iOS product because I‚Äôve been using Android for a very long time, I‚Äôve stock android experience so I know what kind of difference does it make from android to iOS.

- iOS is real smooth! If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it‚Äôs gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps.
- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids.
- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you‚Äôre not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you‚Äôll still find a quality sound!
- About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it‚Äôs wonderful.
The Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there.
Camera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive.
Though zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image.
- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%.
PS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life.
- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good.
- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021.
- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it‚Äôs own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better.

At the end I‚Äôd Recommend this. Even if you‚Äôre switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.",5

My initial test only gave me a read/write speed of around 40 MB/s like many others had here, which is way below my expectation. However, when I switched to the usb 3.0 port at the back of my desktop, the read/write speed significantly improved and met the SanDisk's claim of up to 90 MB/s. This makes me wonder whether everyone who thought he got the counterfeit was using the right port for testing, as many laptops have built-in card readers but not necessarily having the transfer capacity equivalent to usb 3.0 port (could be usb 2.0, which is around 40 MB/s).",1

7175,Pretty good camera,"If you just want to start DSLR Photography but at the same time a bit confused which model to buy , don't think twice go for EOS 1500D . First of all I would like to clear any some doubts .
1.You will get your DSLR Shoulder bag with your camera .
2.The Kit lens is 18-55 II lens
3.The memory card you get with the package can give you the speed hoto 48mbps . If you want good SDHC Memory card you can go for Sandisk 32 gb or Higher . It will give you a speed of 90mbps.
4.You will get a diopter adjustment dial just at the right side of the optical view finder.
5.Screen brightness at level 4 is probably enough for everyone , where you can extend the lcd brightness hoto 8th level . You van guess how much bright it's actually . Easy for outdoors also.

üëâ It's a bit noisy when you shoot in low light , so try to keep atleast minimum light source near your object . Try to keep ISO minimum , change your shutter speed , keep it at 1/10 or lower if the condition outside is too much dark .
The price for which I got these is around 24000 . At this amazing price you are getting a branded DSLR which is basically for beginners , so you may have some complaints about the stuff but believe me it's probably the best option out there with a huge range of modes and operations.

5939,Impressive,"Anyone claiming that the green backed microsdxc cards are fake needs to do better research. In all of Sandisk's marketing, they show a green backed microsd with the ""XC"" instead of ""HC"". In all reviews from reputable websites show the same.

Secondly, anyone complaining about how there is missing storage doesn't understand how marketing of high capacity storage media works. They calculate size based on 1000 kilobyte per megabyte not 1024 kilobyte per megabyte. If you bought the 128GB model, your device would see it as 119GB because your device calculates it as 1024KB per 1MB. It's been done this way for decades.
Here's a list of most of the capacities that SanDisk sells with their corresponding ""actual"" size.

32GB = 29.8023GB
64GB = 59.6046GB
128GB = 119.2093GB
256GB = 238.4186GB
400GB = 372.529GB
1TB = 931.3226GB

When you buy a hard drive, you also don't get the full capacity for the same reason. This isn't just SanDisk.

Third, the speeds of the card are ""UP TO"" x and y read and write. It's highly dependant on what device you're using it in and even then, those are burst speeds, it's not intended to sustain that speed for longer than a few seconds.

It's really sad to see an incompetent reviewer up at the top spot when this is a genuinely high quality product.",5

Which is Type C OTG Compatible.
But when it comes and I used it on my phone it didn't get detect in my phone.
Please don't buy Oneplus Users , If you planning to buy for oneplus phone you better use OTG cable by Oneplus itself.
Better option is buy a normal pendrive which is way cheaper then OTG Pendrive and use it with OnePlus Original OTG Cable.

2575,Left OnePlus for the first time,"Readers,
Earlier I was hesitant to buy an iPhone as 11 comes with LCD panel, I used to be a huge fan of OnePlus and was under the impression that 120 Hz would really make a difference but hands on heart- I‚Äôve been using my iPhone for last 3 days and I am flabbergasted at how vivid the display of iPhone is that too LCD one!

Now coming to delivery- Amazon never disappoints

Seller- Appario Retail, received the original product and in good condition- No complaints. IDK why other users have issues with this retailer

Deal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sure

Don‚Äôt worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the market

Colour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for me

The only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can‚Äôt transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device.

Hope my review helps in decision making!",5

6192,Worst product,"I brought this in February 2019. The mixer produces a very loud noise for its size. We are just a couple and use it occasionally. It was running fine till mid 2020, but then smoke and smell often started coming out of it. Then the plastic coupler failed. Also the blades got blunt just after a year. Now the motor has burner out and I am waiting for 45 days to get it replaced by Prestige as it is still under warranty. The customer care response is pathetic and there is no proper way to escalate the complaints. Please don't buy this cheap overpriced plastic mixer.",1
8143,Good monitor for office and home use,"I expected it to be good.. But when it came, I opened it and plugged it in.. then I was just delighted with happiness..

Believe me it's the best panel under 10k budget.. Many of friends have different types of monitors .. but when it comes to picture quality.. This one is at the top of the list ..

The color reproductions are outstanding..
75hz , free sync , alsmost borderless display and most importantly IPS panel and yes the best IPS panel in the segment..

No bleeding issue..
I didn't notice IPS glow..

Blacks are pure blacks..

But only minimal problem is that it can not be tilted backward..

Don't be panic going through negative reviews.. I will give it 10/10 on the price",5

6138,Cheap quality,"I never thought that the brand Prestige is going to sell such worst product. Believe me only few of lucky customer might have got a good working mixer otherwise this mixer grinder is having defect.
1) Most common problem a burning smell after a grinding, it is due to friction between parts, which leads to damage of bottom parts. I personally replaced the part called Bush 3 times.
2) Mixer makes huge noise.
3) Mixer pots get too much hot while grinding.
4) Mixer pots are not durable. The bottom plastic part breaks easily.

I hope this review is helpful to you.

But this L‚àôG‚àô monitor (22MP68VQ) which I recently purchased during March 2020 {and it was delivered at my residence today itself} appears to be a lot worse than that Dell S2240L monitor. I can observe a yellowish tinge on the Right Half of this L‚àôG‚àô 22MP68VQ monitor especially whilst surfing the internet on white-coloured backgrounds\interfaces. And while playing videos, the black colour [as and when applicable; whenever or whereever it is present] towards the Left Half of the screen seems to be of dull/diluted black colour whereas the black colour [as and when present; whereever present] towards the Right Half seems to be of rich/proper black colour. The brightness is also automatically changing without any doing of mine. The stand is also far worse than what the stand\support of my previous Dell monitor used to be.",5

8257,BEST LG LED PC MONITOR,"I bought this monitor for my work during the nationwide lockdown as I was frustrated working with small screen of my laptop. This monitor is pure treat to the eyes. Very clear & cripsp images, makes working for long hours easy. Can sit back & relax in chair while working as the large monitor makes things easy to read from a distance as well.

I also use to watch Netflix & other platforms too. Works quite well for me & my wife as a TV in a decent sized bedroom. We connect bluetooth speakers for audio as this monitor lacks only audio to use as a TV. Although it has a 3.5mm audio output which you can connect to an external speaker. I even tried my Fire TV stock on it, which works very well.

For someone planning to work from for next few month, someone who works on UI development or runs a stratup, this is a good investment.",5

2276,Iphone vs Android experience,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.

I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.

This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.

Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)

Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)

Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)",3

Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year. It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know.",4

18252,Slightly disappointed,"Please don't buy if you are thinking of tracking SPO2 , Blood Pressure.",2
1123,Not for an Audiophile (honest review),"The only color that they do come in unfortunately is Black, I wish they would have offered one in white too, because that's the color that really stands out and will look really good with a light color device.
Starting with the unboxing experience, packaging is typically what can be expected from Mi similar to their other accessories like power bank and normal earphones. The product comes with a User Manual and extra set of Eartips for making it a perfect fit. I wonder why they haven't added a USB charging cable along with the product which they usually offer with their other products.
The product looks premium and light weight comparing to the other earbuds in this price segment.
Right after poping the case up, instantly you will realise that the latch is not magnetic and doesn't offer with that clicking satisfaction sound that comes from the AirPods case which really signifies the level of quality of the product. The earbuds looks exactly the same size as Mi earphones. The holes for microphone doesn't look appealing at all, looks a flaw in the design of the shell. Considering the size of the case it looks a perfect fit comparing with other wireless earbuds.

Connecting with your pair of Android device is a bit of a hefty task as it doesn't include the W1 chip offered by Apple for smooth pairing or the way Samsung has also implemented the same with their Earbuds for smooth pairing experience. While it takes 3 seconds for you to connect your Airpods to your iDevice it will takes around 15-20 seconds to get your pair of Redmi Earbuds S to connect to your device. So to pair the device you need to press the button on the back on the buds till the red light turns to blinking white which turns on the pairing mode.
There are no sensors to detect the movement hence they will continue to keep playing the audio even when you take them out.
Although, it's a pair of in-ear buds but you will still be able to hear a lot of background noise maybe it's due to the typical shape of the buds. The base is synthetic and flat and you won't hear any deep bass, even listening to pop songs only provides with clear vocals and no music. The quality of the audio is similar to the output that you get from a mobile phone speaker. They do get louder but I won't recommend playing them over 75% volume. I think the main idea for Xiaomi to come up with these is to attend calls and conferences because that's the only thing they can be used for. Battery life looks amazing in figures but after an actual use you will realize that that's not the case at all and you will end up charging them 5-6 times in a week.

Don't go for these if you are on audiophile. Mi Earphones costing Rs.399 sounds far better than the Earbuds S.",2

First of all Amazon did a great job in delivering this product within 2 days and the product was original and brand new.

The problem I observed in these few months of usage is that
1) my battery health is down to 95% now and this is weird as I don't use this phone heavily, nither I play any games in it.

2) reception of this phone is poor",3

Some good points :
1. It monitor your sleep in goid way
2. Have decent battery back up

Need improvement in below :
1. Wake up screen gesture is slow, it takes 2 sec to light up the screen.
2. App and device sync...

Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app.

Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.

PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.",5

2395,Was expecting a better experience....Lot more problematic.,"I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing.
Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice.
There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its better to avoid iphone dual sim models.
The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software & camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.",3

2212,Bad quality of customer service and support,"Dear Amazon Support/Customer Care,

This ls to write and bring to your notice regarding the extremely bad quality of product and support provided by Amazon.

To brief you about the situation, I bought an apple iphone-11 from Amazon and not from any other platform because of the trust on Amazon and it's great support team. But this time around, it was a completely opposite situation. After receiving the product on 30.10.2020, the product was discolored ( like damage); I immediately tried to replace the product through the options available on the app, but the app would just direct me back to the link of apple support website and contact number. After several tries, I final got through the apple support, only to be redirected to the apple store. On reaching the apple Stores during the limited stringent work hours, I was asked to come the next day. On the next day, I was informed that this issue needs to be taken up by Amazon only.

After being extremely tired of this entire long process, with great difficulty, I could connect with the Amazon customer support. The customer support assured me of resolving the issue and asked me to wait for 24 hours to get a call.

Post this, it has already been more than 40 hours and I m yet to receive any call. Furthermore, when I am trying to call the same number, I fail to connect despite repeated tries. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of your product and support; which is least expected from Amazon.

Today being my last day of eligible replacement, I write to you with the Last hope of some relief.

I expect atleast this time around Amazon will help its long loyal customer, who is losing faith in the quality of Amazon.",1

1055,Value for money product,"I had seen and used this product almost a year ago, a friend of mine has the Chinese version (it's essentially the same); I liked it then itself but decided not to import it from China.

I was already using other True Wireless Earbuds, namely Libratone Track Air+, Jabra Elite 65t Active, and Apple's Airpod (first version ... not in the picture). I loved the sound quality of Libratone Track Air+, connectivity, and mic quality of Jabra Elite 65t Active and Apple's Airpod ... overall really good (I am completely in Apple's ecosystem).
However, when I read about Xiaomi launching the Airdots (Redmi Earbud S in India), I was intrigued and with a price point of 1700/- ... I found it no brainer to buy one (though it's cheaper in China but importing and warranty ... better to buy in India itself). I have used these with my iPhone, iPad, Redmi Note 7 Pro, MacBook Pro and HP laptop.

Here are my thoughts (broken in Pros and Cons)

Pros
1 - I like the price point of these TWE. A year or two ago, it was common to see wired Bluetooth earbuds being priced at 3000 and onwards. MI, Realme, and Oppo have changed the game now.
2 - Its a very lightweight product. I have used these earbuds till I drained them from fully charged to almost dead, I did not get any ear fatigue ... in my view, this is a major win over many other earbuds.
3 - By no means, I am an audiophile but having used multiple audio products (both expensive and cheap ones), I can say, these earbuds deliver a lot at this price point. My suggestion - Try and use the right ear-tips to get the best sound quality.
4 - I don't expect it to have any notice-cancellation feature but with right silicon ear-tips, the outside noise is pretty much blocked (this can be both pros and cons).
5 - Inside the case, these earbuds are held magnetically so then don't fall when the case lid is open.
6 - 4+ hours of battery life in the earbuds, that's really good, plus the charging case provides an additional two charging. This is pretty standard, but considering how lightweight are these ... it's quite a feat.
7 - I used these for audio calls and video conferences and there were no concerns from anyone on the other side. I specifically asked and they mentioned, I sounded crystal clear. This is major win for these earbuds.

However, not everything is amazing with these TWE ... Cons
1 - I was disappointed to find that no charging cable is provided with these.
2 - It uses a micro USB for charging ... really. In 2020 .. who does that? Plus, there is no charging cable in the box, so I needed to find one lying in the junk box.
3 - Its difficult to take the earbuds out of the charging case. There is no slot from where you can grip the earbuds and take it out easily ... at least, I haven't found one yet.
4 - Only Black color option ... boring. In China, they have 2 or 3 more options.
5 - The click buttons on the side of the earbuds are slightly tighter and that caused pressure on my ears when trying to use them. These need to be softer.
6 - Though the earbuds haven't fallen out of my ears yet, having rubber wings of some sort, might have given some assurance to active lifestyle users.
7 - No IP ratings ... so I am not sure what will happen if you sweat a lot and these get wet ... or maybe you can be caught in the rain. My suggestion, avoid any wet conditions.
8 - The lids are not magnetically shut but then they don't come open easily ... so I am neutral on that. Still having the magnets would have been interesting and useful.
9 - Lastly, this is not a premium product but could have used an app that can provide EQ options, upgrading firmware, etc.",5

 1..Pixels dont perfectly display colors during DARK/GREY/SHADOW areas WHILE watching MOVIES and during playing GAMES
I.e. u are able to see Small Small pixel dots in those dark/grey/shadow areas which LOOKS VERY TERRIBLE..I regret buying this budget monitor .ü§ï

2..If u guys are buying this for PHOTO EDITING and normal OFFICE WORK then Its Good

3..But DON'T BUY it for watching MOVIES and playing GAMES bcz it Shows CLOUDING effect (YouTube it) as discuss in point 1 above..

4. IPS panel used here is cheapest one that's why it's for 8k to 9k ..I recommend Go for higher range of IPS panel for perfect picture quality..

5...If u can compromise picture quality for budget then buy it ..otherwise don't buy it .bcz it's not perfect budget monitor as u will expect..

6...I also replaced monitor but then to this issue (point 1 ) persist ....and this ISSUE PERSIST IN EVERY LG22MP68VQ monitor bcz the IPS PANEL is same in every unit of this model ...

7087,MindBlowing,"Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier.",5

5993,Don't buy,"Another amazing item from Sandisk.
I've had my eye on this for months and months to replace the 200GB Sandisk micro SD card I've had in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 for the last 2 years. As soon as it dropped to less than ¬£90 I had to buy it.

Transfer of data was done quickly and the card was seen with no problem by my phone.

The size is 400GB but don't expect to get that as useable storage.
Formed in Exfat I have 366.8GB.
This is not a frault card it's due to the way the space is allocated accross sectors and clusters on the device. An explanation is way beyond this review but believe me when I say it's fine.

Depending on the use such as using it on a linux system or if you know you won't have single files bigger than 4GB etc, you could increase the useable capacity slightly. If you're not sure then just leave it how it is.",2

Using multifunctional buttons, you can control music playback & manage incoming calls

*The charging port is the regular micro USB. If your phone has a Type-C port, you will need to carry a separate charging cable for the case.

Positives:
Price Point : Brought this at ‚Çπ46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.
Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chip
Secure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.
Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editing
Gaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.
Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.

What i Dislike:
Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ‚Çπ68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ‚Çπ23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:",5

Pros
- FULL HD IPS LED Monitor with anti-glare finish.
- Good picture quality with accurate colors. Has very high brightness, range from 0 to 100. Presently I have set both brightness and contrast at level 0, and its still bright.
- The 22-inch size doesn't feel very big, feels slightly bigger than 18.5 inch monitor.
- Very sleek and stylish looking with minimal bezels.
- Wall mounting option is provided.
- The monitor weighs just 4 Kgs.
- The monitor is powered by 19V adapter, not direct AC supply, which is better.
- It has many ports, 1 HDMI port, 1 DVI port, and 1 VGA port. For audio out, it has headphone jack. You can also connect a 2nd HDMI cable to the DVI port using an HDMI to DVI adapter.
- The monitor has only 1 switch (joystick), which is under the LG logo.
- Power consumption around 15 Watts.

Cons:
- Increases the CPU running temperature considerably unless you have the latest PC. I had a 720p monitor earlier and CPU temperature was much lower.
- Glossy finish, though not a bad thing, it can easily get scratches and fingerprints.
- Stand is not very stable, can topple forward easily.

2128,The best iPhone - perfect combination of features!,"This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.

-----------------------************------------------------

Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:

1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).

2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.

3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.

4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.

5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.

6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).

7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.

------------------------***********-----------------------

Cons:

1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.

2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.

3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.

4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).

5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.

6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.

--------------------************----------------------

Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.

1043,Disappointing,"Had got my hands on these as I was planning to get one only for the sole reason of avoiding any kind of wires. At this price point I would say it is worth the money spent. It comes in a small magnetic case which is about 6cm*4cm*3cm. The earbuds fit snugly and are lightweight. Overall a good choice. Few points for buyers
-The earbuds magnetically fit into the case. The case lid is magnetic too
-The pairing happens automatically when you take them out of the case. Any kind of pairing problem might be due to earbud malfunction or your device's bluetooth being old
-There was very little/no bass but the vocals were crystal clear. The sound does not break at higher volumes.
-Connection of the buds is strong and works flawlessly at a distance. Might fluctuate near devices like microwave, Modem, etc.
-The noise cancellation (ENC) works okaish. The receiver might hear some background noise if you are in a noisy area. The mic on the buds are on the inside and will work best for a tight fit. If the buds are lose then your voice will suffer.
-Can be used as a mono bud. When you close the lid of the case the buds automatically disconnect
-Last more than 4 hours at lesser volume.
-Might slip out of the ears when talking or chewing for obvious reasons but overall it fits tight.
-Lag should not be an issue. The battery on them is shown on your phone.

Update:- The left earbud stopped working on day 4. Don't know if it is a hardware issue because everyone is having the same problem. I got it replaced and guess what, the replacement bud stopped working within minutes. They did not even try. I issued a refund. Hopefully add some more bucks to my budget and get a better working TWS. I really had high hopes for these.",2

It keeps on refreshing for a few seconds and gets disconnected and reconnected.
Sometimes when connected with Bluetooth 4.0 on Laptop it stops working then you have to reconnect after turn off and on again. Its very annoying may be its due to backward compatible. (1/5)

4082,Not supported with PC/Android TV/Smartphone at the same time.,"Plastic built is a major down point. At this price and considering the use (On The Go). Metallic built is necessary.
Please go for other options if you are willing to buy an otg pendrive.

Another down point is you can only use this with pc/android tv/mobile at the same time if you are using FAT32 file system, which restricts you to transfer file of more that 4GB. and if you manage to format this in exFAT then you can only transfer data between mobile and PC, since most of the android TV out there do not support EXFAT.

So the purpose of purchasing a 64 GB pendrive is defeated. As if you wish you to transfer a 10gb video file to pendrive and then play it on android Tv. Sorry to say but u can't.",2

1332,GOOD TWS EARPHONES,"Redmi Earbuds S üëç for a budget of under 2000/-
Pros:
1)1799/- seems to be a justifiable price due to the lack
of competition in this price range
2) Decent sound profile in all three ranges
3) really lightweight and fits like a glove..even during
exercisee or running, it doesn't tend to fall out
4) Decent battery life as promised (3 and a half hours in
real life
5) Low latency gaming mode works just fine

Cons:
1) Nothing spectacular to say about the microphone
2) Prone to damage if dropped, judging by the plastic
build quality
3) Slight distortion at maximum volume

Side note: If you want to tweak the buttons on the Redmi Earbuds S, use Mobdroid app to reconfigure the button functions. I rarely use voice assistant, which is given as the double tap function. So I used Mobdroid to reconfigure double tap to play the next song.ü§ó",4

5.Good looking

Cones:-
No cones to discuss.you can't get better headphone than this at this price segment.

I had purchased the black one at Rs749 but price keeps on changing from 749-1399 and sometimes 2199 so if want to buy this at cheaper price wait for sometime.

Precaution- make sure to cover the wire by some protective layer otherwise after 1 year the wires will get several cuts due to folding so to avoid use some protective layer around wires and then you can use this for long time",5

1. Doesn't heat much, stays cool for long period of times.
2. Very compact.
3. USB 3.1 gen 1 (However my old laptop had 3.0 port so can't measure full speed) + USB Type C

Default formatting is FAT32 (to support old / long range of devices).
Average file write speed (on 32 GB variant): 22MBPS (on USB 3.0 interface)
Average file read speed (on 32GB variant): 30MBPS (on USB 3.0 interface)
which is not the best but considering it stays cool during transfers, it can be neglected (as it will not going to be wear / soft-broken too early).",5

Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big time

Camera-
Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honest

Sound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notch

Processor- The best

Screen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCD

Value for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro",4

Its a good product. But the sound is not that good. Attended few calls and I am not impressed with the call quality. In this price range what can we expect more.

1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.
2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.
3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don‚Äôt work in angles.
4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen
5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.

When we un-packaged the product, we noticed food particles sticking in 2 grinder jars. Someone had returned the product previously. We decided to retain it as there was no visible damage. However, the mixer grinder that we received makes a very loud shrill sound that is unbearable to the ears. And the blade on the grinder on which the jars fit has also come off.

I had a smaller mixer grinder previously where the jar is placed upside down on the grinder. That way the grinding is executed really well. Using this Prestige grinder, I've tried making almond and coconut milk and banana and mango shake. The grinding is not that good. Big chunks of banana and mango are there in the shake despite running the grinder for longer than usual.

I would not recommend this mixer grinder.",1

1-Flash Makes too much noise
2-You cannot record a good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.
3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.
4-Wifi does not control the video recording function
5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.
6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.
7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.

Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.

Connectivity: Not good. Sometimes both the buds are out of sync.

Had to return it in a day since left earbud stopped working/ had loose contact in the charging case.

Earbuss in this price range is probably not a good option.",3
1013,An honest review on the product.,"Pros:
1. 10 meters radius coverage.
2. If you use this with zoom meetings, you get normal audio and bass audio. Normal audio is loud, but bass audio is very, very louder and deeper.
3. Charging both case and pods are straightforward and easy.
4. Audio is clear on calls and audio music.
5. Since you get small, medium and large ear buds, you can customise this for your ear. Fits beautifully.

Cons:
1. Right out of the box, after 5 to 10 times using the charging box, it is loose.
2. If you use this to watch videos and movies, you will see lagging. Video will be first and short delay followed by audio.
3. Pods are delicate to handle. Please be careful.
4. No charger or charging cable provided, since I use Xiomi phone, I had the compatible charger, so was not a big issue here.
5. Although Chinese product, it holds its weight in new emerging market but with delicate materials, care should me main focus while handling this.

Since the box was loose, I gave 4 out 5. But, go for it. It's worth the investment. However, since this is my honest reviews, I would leave the decision to purchase entirely on you.

Good Luck, stay safe and have a wonderful day.

Update - 1: The volume dropped by 10% after some uses. When on calls, the voice lags, only sometimes.",4

Either there is defect in left earbud or in left charging slot. Please don't go for this product. You can check other reviews also. Others also reported that left earbud stops working after sometime. If you're lucky enough, it will stop working within return period. If it stops working after return period, it will be loss for you. Don't waste your money on this cheap product.",1

2298,Honest review after using for 1 month,"I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.
I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.

Pros:
1. Superb processor- My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth
2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode
3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient
4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date
5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applications

Cons:
1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone
2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores
3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.
4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.
5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.

Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.",5

I have not tested it for games as I am not into it. I really liked the reader mode and very wide range of adjustment features provided with the monitor. The button given for the feature adjustment however does not look long lasting. I have given four star because they could have given a button of better quality for adjustment. The clarity with mac mini is fantastic for 1080p and 720p. They additionally have 1920 x 1600 (very good for reading). The hdmi cable along with it is okay but I prefer my belkin cable which is more smooth in terms of plugging in or out with mac and monitor.

6000,A defective product for all... Read all reviews,"The MicroSD card works as expected although it's too slow for running Android apps from it (through Adoptable Storage) despite the claim in the description that it's suitable for apps. Some apps do run perfectly fine from the MicroSD card, but many others are slower to load or have performance issues that don't exist when saved on the phone's internal storage.

I would suggest making sure that your phone has enough internal storage for apps in the first place, rather than relying on expandable storage like MicroSD cards on Android. They're just not fast enough and are more suited to streaming service downloads and photos than they are for apps.",1
1135,Pathetic battery backup: Not suitable for long-term use,"The design is lightweight and compact, just as described. Personally I didn't like the button feature, and there's also no way to skip songs as is available in Boult Audio Combuds.

However, the negative points are:
1. Buds don't fit tightly enough in the case and if the case is disturbed, the buds might get loose and stop charging.
2. Another issue is connectivity, however, at this price I wouldn't expect more.
3. The surround sound is fake, and the extra power can actually hurt your ears. This was noted by me during a 1.5 hour call, which resulted in my ears hurting even with one bud (Mono mode)
4. Battery backup is pathetic. Each bud can go upto 1.5 hrs on calls (max), and music playback for both buds is 1 hr, after which the sound falls and rises, sounding weird and you HAVE TO CHARGE AGAIN!",2

Redmi earbuds S on other hand provide much better calling experience. And since the music quality is also decent, I give these earbuds double thumbs up.
If your only preference is music, then you might want to scale up a bit on the budget.
But if you want enjoyable music experience, decent calling functionality and a very compact sized earbud, these should do the job just fine.
It is very hard to argue about anything at this price point actually.

1238,"Best Review, Trust me.","Hey all! I did a lot of research before buying this earbuds. Countless searching online, added with comparing products, reviews, price. So trust me, when you go through my detailed review. I was skeptical about shifting to a TWS (truly wireless stereo) earphone from the average wireless segment. Keeping the cost into the factor, I didn't have a lot on my plate. I could spare around 2000 and comparatively Redmi airbuds S was the only product available in that range (with a familiar company name).

1) Connectivity, Durability, Charging -
The device connects pretty easily, with no issues as such. I moved over to the next room, despite the hindrance in between the earbuds and the phone, there was no significant problems as such.
The device seems sturdy enough, a lot of people complained about the quality of the charging case, and yes they are definitely of pretty cheap quality, but they do feel good if you do decide to get a hands on (cause of the matte finish).
The charging wasn't an issue (despite no USB included in the box), the device charges automatically when you place it in the charging case. The case itself needs a 2 hour charging stand time and as an user you have no way of making out when the box is out of charge. The device stayed awake for 3-4 hours on a single, so that's that.

2) Sound, Comfort, Value for money -
The device houses a SBC codec, which is the cheapest one in the market. It is an universal standard (all Earbuds have to have it) so imagine how average it actually is. I believe in ""burning-in"" my Earphones, which basically means...using your device for long hours to get an optimised sound quality. I used the device for two days at long stretches only to be left utterly disappointed with the quality, which eventually led me to return the product back to Amazon. The lows, highs, trebles, base, you can't differentiate between them. The sound was muddy and muffled and led to a lot of noise rather than music. That's a big thumbs down on that.
They are pretty comfortable, I did go for a run and cycle ride and they sat in my earlobes perfectly. I didn't feel any pain whatsoever and the fit was snuggly as well. Comfort won't be an issue.
The price range which it offers, no other popularized brands decided to offer such a product in that range (but now realme stepped in), TWS earbuds are very costly and not meant for the average user. So on the part where value for money is involved, I suppose they are definitely a good bargain if you planning to upgrade to a TWS.

Overall Verdict : The device is entry level TWS in the Indian market with a price which no one else dares to offer, Redmi and Realme did. Now if you are planning to upgrade from the wireless BT or wired earphones, they are a good pair of earbuds taking the price into consideration, but end of the day, we all buy earphones to listen to something...so in my opinion, this product is not worthy enough for that. They sound is incorrigible and unethical from the brand (I was using their sports by wireless and really loved that product).
So now all depends on you as an user, if you are really desperate to buy a TWS, then go for these (or the Realme Buds). But if sound quality is your priority, then wait, or buy something else.

Thank you for reading carefully, now I it's your choice.",3

Pros
High bass specifically considering price range
Decen build quality

Cons:
As its little loud,full bass only come out when its on full volume so i used equaliser but it though made bass little muddy

Guess what
It's was not working either

And now I got a another replacement
It was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experience

The Amazon services suck
I really wanted a refund I don't got it

Tip: for buying monitor
Don't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitor

For gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panel
Usually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fps
For gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast
60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic card

Buy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budget

Va panel is a compromising option between ips and TN panel",5

After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.
please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.
I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...

1306,Worth the price,"One of the best true wireless earphones under 2k, even if they overpriced it in India , I would say it‚Äôs worth it.
Pros -
1. Vocals sound simply amazing ! Highs , mids , simply awesome !
2. These are really small and very compact, when I got these in my hands I was like daaayyymmmn tis tiny ! The case is very small that I misplaced it somewhere and couldn‚Äôt find it
3. The fit is just perfect, you can‚Äôt even feel it in your ears
4. Gaming mode - it actually works ! I‚Äôve tried the realme buds air with gaming mode and I‚Äôve got to say these are on point to it. PUBG and COD is just flows very smoothly, giving a lag free gaming experience
5. Connectivity is also amazing

Cons-
1. Built quality, the feel and look extremely cheap, the lid of the case is all wobbly, I think it‚Äôs gonna Break
2. Bass, the bass is alright but when listening to some songs it sounds like someone farting,
3. Battery life is just average
4. With gaming mode on the battery gets drained pretty quickly
5. No charging cable in the box, but who doesn‚Äôt have a micro usb cable these days ? üòè

At the end, I would recommend this with all my heart.",4
1671,Best for the price,These earphones are good. And for the price I think currently there is no better option than this. The case looks very good in matte black finish but doesn't look very durable. It can handle some drops but take care of it.,4

I was shooting 1080p and I came home with over 10 hours of excellent footage and I had no issues at with the card during the whole trip, in changeable outdoors conditions. Transferring files back home was lightning fast.

There's not an awful lot you can say about a memory card, but if you are a professional, or serious amateur, whatever you are buying SD cards for it's worth going that little bit further with your money and getting these pro versions.

2382,Easiest Phone to Review. Read further to get the gist,"Pros :
-Great camera! The best ever. You don‚Äôt need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.
-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.
-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage
-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage
-Games run insanely well with high end graphics
-Wireless Charging
-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhones
Cons:
-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn‚Äôt agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool
-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.
-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%
-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates
-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don‚Äôt know why apple is being stupid on this
-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box
-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale
-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb
-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.",5

The wires are strong, and the ease with which you can carry this around is what makes it more interesting.

The maximum pages 50 it has given. Till now I have brought 4 cartridges worth rs. more than 4k which more than cost of this printer.

2328,Brutally honest review: Switched from ios to android and now to ios,"Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.

Pros:
1. Best battery life in an iPhone - 3110 mAh
2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )
3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)
4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.
5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.
6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.
7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).
8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.
9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.
10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.
11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)
12. Premium feel phone
13. Its an iphone
14. Good resale value

Cons:

1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)
2. Minor software limitations as compared to android
3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs
4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)
5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.

Conclusion:
I would personally rate this at 9.5/10
If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it‚Äôs as easy as that
And as for me, I‚Äôm very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.",5

Has an inbuilt in line microphone which allows hands-free call accepting
About the sound quality it is awesome. It is capable of giving the experience of my LG mini hifi system. With greater bass it is awesome.
It is really comfortable to put on ears due to soft cushion like thing provided at the earpiece. It also has a trendy look and is stylish. Sound leak was also less. I am using it from the day I got it and is using till now without any loss in sound quality. Superb product. Got no words to explain it.

Have not faced any data corruption till now.
Write speed is fast enough even when using the card with the adapter in the A7M3. Have not faced any issue wherein the buffer wasnt able to write to the card or the cam stopped shooting as the card was not fast enough to clear the buffer.
In comparison the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD card costs 1.3k more than this and offers only 10MB/s more of read speed. Hence getting the MicroSD for the cam was a no brainer.\

Inside the box, we have the earbuds itself and the charging case which has a matte black finish and a micro USB charging point. You can charge your earbuds almost three times from 0 to 100 using the case.

Coming to the earbuds, they fit very well and are decent in the sound department considering the price. Bass is not too heavy. Playback time is about 3 hours on full volume and you have playback and calling controls. The mic is pretty good too.

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this for the price and if you're not a gamer, you can choose this over the Redmi earbuds S.",5

137,3 Years Review (Great Headphones),"I'm using this headphone for a long time. And I wear these each and everyday during commute and while working.
Hands up the best one out in the market regarding the sound quality and build quality in this segemnt.
Pros:
1. Good amount of base for indian base lovers.
2. Clear sound.
3. Adequate treble.
4. Long cable for connecting to your phone. And this baby is tough. Wouldnt break easily. Believe me i took it to its limit.
5. Comfortable for 3 hours of continous listening.
6. Alliminium connector with spring threadded protection. It helps a lot in keeping the connector intact.
7. Long head band for large headed people. And quite comfy for this price segment.

Cons.
Not much to say since these does not affect the usage that much.
1. The spring threadding will rust after around a year only if you use continously like me, but it still wouldn't break. And just the spring would rust, not the other part.
2. The skin on the ear muffs would tear off a bit after a year. Only if used to its extent. I would recommend to just take out the ear muffs and then brush the skin off completely, it would give it a grewish colour and it works fine.
3. Sound is a bit muffled but its hard to be felt.
4. After 3 hours of continous usage the sweet spot just fades away. It hurts a bit. (Read the rest for a sollutuion)

I bought this headphone 3 years ago and it costed me then around 1200 INR. just yesterday the left side of the pivot limit broke, which means that the left side of the ear would rotate much more than it should rotate. But considering the price and its usable life im surprised. Fun fact: I intentionally broke the right pivot too, so that bot of them can rotate freely. and it made the headphone a lot better to wear ;) i can now wear it for longer than usual.",5

7114,Awesome camera,"I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .
Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.
This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:
- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.
-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.
-Also keyboard also it good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .
-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .

These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.
Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.
Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.
Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.
FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.
Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.
U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.",5

20079,Good,"It's very stylish looking new era watch that provides you lots of option. I have used it from last 1 week and it's my honest review
1. Watch has a basic design with sturdy looking material. Glass provided on watch is easily scratched so be careful while using. Strap is good but not best also alternative strap is not provided in package.
2. Now the OS .... It's a simple looking and operated within 4 swaps up down right left OS nothing complicated in it. You can easily find all the utilities. There is 4 faces given in watch you can add from cloud or from your phone photos.
3. Sensor provided are good but not 1st class... Your o2 reading is always fluctuate and all the time it's either 95 or 99. Heart beat sensor is more accurate tallied with BP monitor. BP measurement is also near the accurate. Step tracker is good
4. App provided by boat in phone is not that great there is some issues like you have to sync it every time. Also heart rate display in app is not seen unless you take a live reading in watch. There is login issue also you have to login every single day in that app.

Over all its worth the money you spend but not that great",3

Read speed: 50MBPS max.

Yes it can record 4k 30fps videos without any issues. I don't know about 4k 60fps as it goes to internal memory by default.

It's a good package for this price. If you are looking for an alternative you can check out Samsung Evo Plus which costs some 200 ruppes more.

Nothing extremely satisfactory but does the job for you. Pretty good for an average consumer.",4

Cons:
1.Only good for a small room. I put it in hall and can't even hear sound in the next room. But nice surround experience though.
2. I bought it in an offer. If I would have paid a greater money, I would have found it just average.
3. Every speaker doesn't emit the same amount of sound, don't know why though.",5
11327,Hated it! Pathetic service!!!,"The sound quality is pretty nice and bass is good too.

I'd have rated this atleast 4 if there was a peace of mind owning a product from this brand. I bought this product and used it like for 3 months and then the right channel and the mic stopped working. I had then claimed for warranty and it looks like the support team of Boult is least bothered to respond to emails.
They got no seriousness to look at the customer satisfaction. They even closed the ticket without resolving the issue which is quite surprising on how these guys respond.

The only reason for buying this product was to know the reliability factor and the quality to upgrade to a higher end product from Boult. Now that I lost the trust factor on this brand, I would never ever look for buying an other product from Boult.",1

It does not grind well anything.

Details:
Dry stuff has to be separately smashed and wet needs to be put on mixer for half hour or so. Even after that, the finished product is not even close to what we used to get using our old local mixer.
The technician who we called to fix this told us that this is how the quality of mixer is and it cannot be improved any further.",1

2599,Nice product,"Pros :
Touch is really smooth
Battery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .
Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.
IOS14 update came within 2 days
Switching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.
Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.
Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.

Cons
Battery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .
Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.
Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.

20089,Good,"It's very stylish looking new era watch that provides you lots of option. I have used it from last 1 week and it's my honest review
1. Watch has a basic design with sturdy looking material. Glass provided on watch is easily scratched so be careful while using. Strap is good but not best also alternative strap is not provided in package.
2. Now the OS .... It's a simple looking and operated within 4 swaps up down right left OS nothing complicated in it. You can easily find all the utilities. There is 4 faces given in watch you can add from cloud or from your phone photos.
3. Sensor provided are good but not 1st class... Your o2 reading is always fluctuate and all the time it's either 95 or 99. Heart beat sensor is more accurate tallied with BP monitor. BP measurement is also near the accurate. Step tracker is good
4. App provided by boat in phone is not that great there is some issues like you have to sync it every time. Also heart rate display in app is not seen unless you take a live reading in watch. There is login issue also you have to login every single day in that app.

Over all its worth the money you spend but not that great",3

Pros:

- Satisfied with Apple‚Äôs claims about security and privacy
- Works great within the apple ecosystem. Already have an iPad and AirPods and connections are seamless across products

- Siri Shortcuts is great for creating workflows
Cons:
- Not great for media consumption. Screen resolution is a little over 720p
- Camera is great. But as of now I haven‚Äôt been able to use it to click better photos than I did on my previous phone (OnePlus 7). I don‚Äôt know, Maybe I‚Äôm using the camera wrong :P
- Had to buy the charger separately :(
- Lacks notification control to the extent that I want. In android I could have rules for different notifications within the same app, not possible here

16888,Wonderful,Nice product. Worth for money,4
5955,Worst product broken in one month,"Pretty sure its not a fake, as all the major check out and I got it from Amazon.ca not a marketplace seller. Things that I have cheked:
The appearance of the package (text is very crisp and the paint looks like high quality paint, with deep colours and also some reflective paint.The quality of the image is comparable to a genuine Ultra Plus purchased at best buy. There is a sticker inside the package that promotes their android app, same as the Ultra Plus. The rear looks as crisp as the front.)
The adapter (text looks legit when compared to the genuine one I have, date is printed on the back, also very crisp. I compare a known genuine adapter to the included adapter in the photos.)
Card appearence (The text is crisp, same font and text positionning as the Ultra Plus, but the rear destabalised me a little, whit the black sticcker on the green PCB, I expected faint writing on a black PCB)
Card capacity and speed (As can be seen in the photos, the write is around 70MB/s and read is 75MB/s and the capacity checks out without any errors.)
What scares me the most is that the read speeds aren't even near the advertised maximum of 160MB/s, but it might be bottlenecked by the integrated sd card reader of the laptop I used. The fact that the card states that it is made in china is also offputting, because the Ultra Plus from best buy states that it is made in Malaysia, which is what I expected for this card. Finally, the green PCB with the black sticker also makes me feel off about it.
The GoPro H7 Black didn't seem to refuse this card for filming a short 4k60 clip, but then again it also worked with the Ultra Plus which has lower advertised speeds and isn't recommended for this use.
So if you are willing to take your chances as I did, just be sure to get it from Amazon.ca and not a marketplace seller (not that I have anything against them) for the best chances of it being real and not counterfeit.",1

2313,Quality vs Rest of those in markets,I had iPhone 6s and it‚Äôs been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this. unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.,4

6095,"Substandard product, designed to fool the customer!","The build quality is not the best in the market. The plastics used in the mixer makes you feel it as of below average quality but not the worst. I got this for ‚Çπ2,973. For this price you are getting features like a Juicer Jar and an extra mixer jar. So cannot complain much. Considering the price, you are getting good product. Buy this only if you compromise on the build quality and want the extra jar and juicer.

I have given four stars because of the below average build quality. Meanwhile none of the body/part/jar has broken till now. Everything is fine. But they may break if used roughly.

1015,Major issues with one of the ear buds - stopped working,"Updated review a month‚Äôs usage -
- had to exchange the product as the left earbud stopped working within 5 days.
- call quality isn‚Äôt that good as experienced during business group meetings, the voice trails off in-between and you loose the conversation
- the earbuds aren‚Äôt very comfortable for longer duration usage as it starts hurting
- go for these earphones if only you are on a tight budget of less than 1.5k OR if you want to experiment with a TWE.
- build quality is questionable and I suspect one of the earbuds will stop working anytime
- aside from these negatives, it‚Äôs quite decent for the price offered and Bluetooth pairing works smoothly across IOS and android devices

Old review when tested for 3 days - It all comes down to the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô you need a TWS or truly wireless earphones. If your reason, like mine was for a decent pair of TWS earbuds at a throwaway price of less than 2/3k and the utility I wanted mostly from it was the ability to make phone calls with clarity and without much environmental background noise and also to watch a movie/listen to songs with decent sound quality - then these earbuds are a definite buy. If your need is for earphones with high-very high sound quality for your music/movie watching, then these won‚Äôt satisfy you. Aside from the tech specs already the company provides, my personal pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs are as such -
Pros
- incredibly cheap pricing for a decent TWS and balanced features at this price
- both earbuds work independently and you can use a single earbud as well
- great phone call quality as I experimented over the last few days. I conducted business calls over a mask and in the outdoors with background noise but the receiver never complained of the sound quality
- great power backup - gives 4 hours constant usage and then the case gives a total of 12hr backup
- it also has Siri/google assistant support
- the case has a lovely matte finish and the earbuds magnetically close into them. The ability to give a premium feel to such cheaply priced earphones is awesome

Cons 1
- build quality - the earbuds in itself gives a cheap plasticky quality but it‚Äôs definitely lightweight
- form factor - I would say I am not too happy about the fit of the earbuds into the ears. This could differ from person to person. For me personally the earbuds while they do fit in, they don‚Äôt feel safely snug in them for usage during athletic activity like running or working out
- this is asking for much for sure but the button on the earbuds thats used for activating the voice assistant and for play/pause media is quite hard to click and that hurts when one has to do so while wearing it. If only it could have had been touch sensitive.",3

8142,Worst product and worst service,"<<dishonest Seller/LG>> THEY ARE SENDING RENEWED PRODUCT AT NEW BUYING.
I'm saying this because the display panel (i.e. LCD panel) changed to lower quality panel. At the display resolution 1920 X 1080 @ 75 Hz the blue color (color code #0078d7) looks pixelated and if the refresh rate is reduce to 60 Hz this problem almost gone. This thing happen when the panel mismatched with the controlled board.
I asked to monitor technicians and other who also repair monitors, they have same opinion.

I saw this monitor at our local computer shop and my friends also buy this same model from local shop. But the monitors from local shop has a grate picture quality and less back-light bleeding (barely noticeable ). And no pixelated blue color.

There is no option for No Star rating, so I've to given one Star.

I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. Because the response time is about 10ms on normal settings.
About 5ms is possible by turning on the faster mode but there is too much inverse ghosting. And that will be a bad experience of gaming.
Also beware of LG service at Westbengal region. According to their warranty policy the product can't be replaced only repaired. And the service person can't do anything except changing the service date.

(In my case I called for the upper bar glowing problem but the service person, instead of coming to my house he solved the problem by himself. Yes , the person send a problem solved massage to LG against my complained without coming to my house, without seeing the problem with monitor. That was his supper power)",1

I used JBL and other best brands.. this is on par with all those brands. Bass is decent and in right balance. It's not too thumpy bass.. but it's not fitting into the ears firmly, even small shake or touch of the wire it comes out of ear.. may be I need to use proper earcap size which is provided. overall good. But after six months one side of the earphone stopped working. I sent it for replacement. But i received same defective product without servicing .. after that I again sent back. And I received new replacement product i.e. current version of angled jack.
Coming to the new replaced product i.e. current version of angled jack model. I would say it's not like original version(straight jack). Original version sound quality, build quality, material and look and feel was premium and everything was perfect. But this new version is plasticky, all are cheap quality and not very good looking . Sound quality of new version also not good. Overall current version angled jack model is worthless.. totally I lost my money",3

2135,Switched From Samsung Note 9 ( Adequately Satisfied ),"Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.
A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.
Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.
There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.
Videos are Super Stable ++.
Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.
IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.
Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.
5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.
Built quality solid.
Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.
Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)
Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.
And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!
All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.",5

1231,Best tws buds under 2k. Pretty bad for gaming.,"Writing this review after three months of full usage. Used with both Windows laptop and Android device.
1) The battery life is just exceptional. If you start using them at 100% you will still have 50-60% after 2-2.5 hours which is great for such a budget pair of earphones.
2) The latency is very bad. While playing PUBG after firing 10 bullets after 5-10 second the sound of bullets come.
3) The connectivity is just seamless with both Windows device and Android.
4) The charging is quite fast for the buds when kept inside the case. And for the case i used a 12W Rapid charger so for me the charging speed for case was also quite fast.
5) Build quality is okish, I'd give 3 starts in that area. The buds look like they are very delicate. And the case is completely made of cheap plastics so while closing the case you can feel that build quality isn't great.
6) Overall i think that if you are on a very tight budget (like me) then only you should get these if not then go for some other tws buds. Also if you only want tws buds the only buy it or there are other options of neckband like OnePlus bullet Z or Oppo enco M31.

These are best tws buds under ‚Çπ2,000 because Redmi is a trusted brand.",4

After one print it stops printing and the customer service is also pathetic and bad I have tell them to give a demo but they not listen our problem i tell them to send a technician they said we can fix it from here how is this possible. So I am giving one star for this printer,1
1326,One of the best valued for money TWS in this price range.,"The sound quality is better than I expected. It delivers punchier bass and non distorted treble even at the fullest volume. The built quality feels premium.
The noise cancellation is great. You can barely hear the surrounding noises even at low volumes.
However the buds does not fit perfectly into the ears. It feels like the buds are gonna fall from ears but still it is manageble.
The calling experience was decent, not that great but ok.

If you are looking for a great sound quality TWS in budget, go for it.

But one suggestion to all, don't buy any products using Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, you will be charged nicely. That too if you are choosing NO EMI COST option then gone case, get ready to pay extra charges including interest charges and GST against each installments and products. Whatever they show in calculation details (Structure) all bullshit. I nicely charged for this product by selecting EMI option and just to save 1000/- I paid extra 2000/- for this product.

And I purchased one more product 'Hoodie' the cost was 799/- by using Amazon Pay ICICI Card it costed for me 942.82 including GST even though it was a one payment.

So my sincere suggest don't use *Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card at all*. And don't go for any EMI options its better to buy in one payment to avoid additional charges. No body will help you once it is charged to you. ICICI Customer care they play very safe game.",5

5764,Nice ..,Very good .....,5
6004,Good Mixer Grinder with noise.,"Bought for my new drone, I went for this one for immediate delivery via Prime and because it had an appropriate speed rating. Realistically U3 is required for high speed video, and 64Gb is perfectly suited to 30 minutes of flying time in higher resolution. I have found the footage a bit jerky, but to be fair that is probably down to the performance of the drone camera rather than this card. The price was OK, not the cheapest by any means, but next day delivery made it a good option. The fact if comes with an adaptor is a nice bonus, meaning I can upload footage to my laptop easily after filming.

A decent memory card, I'll probably test it in my GoPro to compare the footage.",4

15376,Decent product,Good,3
3203,Printer is good but the Cartridge is way expensive,"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3

The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12‚Äôs)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn‚Äôt need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.",5
4606,Fake product,It's not the geniune product. It won't work even in mobile. They just give 114gb space. It's is quite better to go with same product with other brand.,1

122,Experience of 2yr usage & also the Replacement process with Boat,"I purchase these headphones in Oct 2018, editing my review now in Oct 2020.
CONS(before replacement by Boat):-
- cheap build quality
- durability is not that much, earcups got loose
- little uncomfortable on the ear, but you'll get used to it.
- wire was not good
- base problems
PROS(before replacement by Boat):-
- quite good sound quality in this price range.
- Mic is good
#Earcups got loose, then I had to replace them just after the 1st month (Replacement process took around 18 days)

-Earcups got tight after the replacement, nothing else.
-After 2-3 months started having crackling sound, then right side stopped working.
- Replaced them around march 2019 (took 20 days)
# Experience after the 2nd replacement:-
CONS-
- little uncomfortable on the ear, just like before.
PROS-
- durability was good.
- wire has a good quality, guess it was changed
- Earcups & the folding mechanism was working upto the point, durability was good now.
- sound was okay & the bass improved.
- mic was already good.
Note:-
1. You need to register the product on their website, it took me 6-7 times to register my headphone, cuz of their site issues.
2. They'll give you no. to call on, but it'll never connect.
3. When you go to their service centre they can't take your headphones, they only take earphones. Service centre personnel said that they don't take this product. I mean I traveled 2 hours just to shock myself, service centre never picked the call.
3. Replacement takes too much time cuz of courier service they use.()
4. This model's service center is only in mumbai. In my case it took 18-19 days on avg basis for: delhi->mumbai->delhi

Speacial Note:
# Maybe the Seller is selling the diminished quality products or idk, cuz durability, sound & base improved after the replacement.
# In this price range of 600-850 these are bang for bucks, but you may have to replace it.
# Now after 1.5 yrs after the 2nd replacement, wire near the plug is damaged by normal wear & tear, but it is still working fine, but yeah I guess their time is coming.",3

214,For Middle class gamers,"Iam writing this review after 4 months of use.i ordered it on january great indian sale at 650/-.So it was a great deal.
When coming to headset its just awsome for bass anf sound.The problem is with mic its just emits echo to receiver out there.But it ise not much problem for me bucause it is very little as it doesn't have a noise cancellation mic.
As it is an ON-EAR headphone it will pain of u keep it for 3-4 hrs.But it is only initial for 1month.
And it is a great headphone when comes to PUBG i assure that if u r looking for a budget buy for all purposes headphones then it suits best for u as it did for mine.
From four months i don't see a single con except for that mic echo but it will also come when u r near wind.
Overall it was a great buy for me and if u r a middle class teen like me then u can buy this with no doubt..
I think u found this helpful..üòÄüòä",5

6123,Best for kitchen items.,"I bought this product in the month of NOV 2020 and was using from them.here is my review

1) Noise level is too high. Even neighbors who are approx 50 to 100m apart from my house can hear the sound of the grinder. At night neighbors shall shout if we use the grinder.Such is the noise level

2) Leekage from all the jar. After multiple complaints to Prestige it is still not rectified on all the jar.

I think above 2 point itself make useless of using thhe product.

So think twice before you buy the product

Even after complaint to change the product got with negative reply from prestige.",5

6131,Old used product received,"I bought this mixer because Amazon showed it as most bought. I had Philips mixer earlier and it was so much better, so less noise and even grinding. This prestige one is so noisy and the grinding is not good either, there are still chunks of food left even after grinding for a long time. Also, just after 1.5 months of usage, the plastic shaft at the top of the mixer and the bottom of the jar melted and I had to get it changed. Such rubbish mixer, waste of money",1
8242,Good product.,Awesome for 1080p gaming.. Though I was hesitant to buy this as it has amd free sync.. Which works with only amd graphics cards.. And I have an Nvidia 1060.. But ordered it due to its looks and amazing bezel less style.. And of course it's from LG so I bought it and ya I must say it looks amazing.. And build quality is great.. Just go for it and you won't regret.. Best one below 10k out there,5

5065,For Rs.1799 as of Jan 2021 | from Appario Retail,"Bought for Rs. 1799 as on ending of Jan 2021 SanDisk Extreme Pro 128gb A2 U3 V30. I have already owned 64gb version for my Gopro which works very well. But i do find some difference in the back of card.

Total user space available 119gb, 9gbs are not usable. Read write speeds are ok not as advertised, not much of a difference to be very frank. Some files dp get corrupted here and there on Gopro it might be because of the speed or gopro issue but it's very very rare like 1 in 100 videos or 1 picture in 5000 pictures.

Seller: Apprario Retail PVT. LTD. Good seller!",5

19762,Just okay,Watch is ok to buy...But Price is on Very High side...If its for 1800 or 2000 it would be better,3
9156,That's Royals,Gifted to my Sis. I‚Äôm glad that she liked it & impressed with the Sound & Bass. At this price this is one of the great sound system. For those who are commenting that Sound & Bass is not good well you won‚Äôt be getting a Bose 5.1 at ‚Çπ3-4K. You‚Äôll need to spend 3-4Lakhs for that. So don‚Äôt expect Dolby Atmos sound at this range. And for the people looking for an sound system at budget then definitely this is for you.,5
8252,Happy with this purchase,"After many research i purchased LG screen and i thought it'll be good vcoz i have 1 already.
Bt in this 22MP68VQ (Right side in photos) 1. has awkward things not adjusted screen auto pr manually so edges of the screen are cut.
2. Awkward yellow colortone which i never have in same LG brand other monitor and it's not even adjust after many setting.
3. It has ips display same has i have other bt this has screen bleeding issues.
4. Not good for video editing or animation work bcoz extra yellow color can change ur whole videos color.

1235,Earpod Stopped working,"I bought this earphones as a diwali gift.

The earphones were good, but then 2 hrs later they stopped working.

Fortunate to have Amazon Replacement, I got them replaced.

This time they worked for about 9 days.

But then they have again stopped working.

Fully Charged, extremely light use, and careful handling yet, it took less than 10 days to malfunction and die.

Really bad build quality. Cannot recommend them to anyone.

The sound quality wasn't impressive either, there are other earphones in same price category with better experience.

Bass was decent to be honest, and Noise cancellation is just due to the eartips and not because of software.

They are not using software based noise cancellation, that is its just passive noise cancellation",1
2168,Almost good phone,"Excellent phone so far. Bought it for more secure access. Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).

On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy. Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.

I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing",4

2441,Defective product and no support. Read this completely and never get fooled.,Never buy such costly products from amazon. They never return it back if the product is defective or even it‚Äôs not working. I brought this iPhone 11 and found there is a small foreign particle inside its display. Amazon asked me to get it checked in Apptronics and apptronics people are not even ready to touch the phone as it is not purchased from apple store. Now I‚Äôm using the same defective device. Got a good lesson- Never buy any product above 5000 from online shopping websites.,1

Pros

- Good battery back up. With full charge it can last upto 6-7 days, even with continuous heartbeat check.

- Good activity tracking, most cases it's accurate and have mostly used options.

- Have option of SPO2 and BP monitoring. Though the BP monitoring is something can't be considered accurate most of the time

Cons

- Below average app for tacking
- Lack of good watchface, there is no update in watchface section.
- Sync issue sometimes

For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.

In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050 Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.

For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.

I‚Äôd give it a 8.5/10

I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would‚Äôve been amazing.

1272,"Full review. Pros, Cons & Tips to maintain.","Pros:
*The headphones are really pocket friendly. You will spend really less for these. I bought these for INR1,799.
*these are really light in the ears. It weighs really less about 4grams per earbud.
*these have a secure fit in most of the ears. I have really small ears. And these fit perfectly.
* there is no noise cancelation rather it has noise isolation. That means the fit reduces outside noise from entering the ears.
*if you love base, then these are good for you in a budget.
*the charging case is small. It fits all pockets. You can just keep it and forget it.
* The heaphones support SBC or aptX. That means it is clear in some phones that support aptX.

Cons:
*It sometimes disconnects even if the primary device(your phone in this case) is right next to you.
*Even if its connected to your phone it sometimes stops receiving sound or emiting sound to or from your device when you are in a call. You have to reconnect it to fix this problem
* It is not for a prolong use. Your ears will start itching after an hour or two.
*It has one microphone on each heaphones but the other person on a call will not be able to hear you properly if you are in a crowded place or in streets. I use an Iphone and an MI Phone but it is the same in both.
*The charging of the charging case take a lot of time.
* The sound quality is not as pleasing at it should be. The sound is a bit muffled sound. Tere is a lot of base. The mids are somewhat missing. The lows are okayish.
* It charges with micro usb which is an outdated charging type. And the worst part is that they dont include a charging cable in the box.
* The buttons on each earbuds are a bit stiff and you might end up shoving inside your ear canals while trying to press the button.
* The included eartips are of a really cheap quality. Try using any other eartips you like.
* The charging case has over heating issues.

Conclusion: If you really want to buy these headphones then follow some of the tips for the better experience.

Tips:
* Always charge the charging case separately from the earbuds. I recommend to take out your earbuds and use it while you charge the case. When the charging is done, then put the earbuds in the box. Since the box overheats, it might damage your earbuds if you charge the case with the earbuds inside.
* Use a low voltage output to charger. Chargers of these days have a really high voltage output which overheats batteries. Which leads to reduction of the battery capacity. I recommend to use a powerbank or your desktop to charge the charging case.
* Keep your headphones away from any water. However these are rated IPX4 but i recommend not to use these in a normal rain.
You can use it in light drizzles. But it is still risky.
* Dont let the charging case run out of battery. When the case has around 10% to 20% battery, plug the headphones to charge.
* Also dont always keep the battery fully charged all the time. Every battery has a charge cycle. The more you charge the more you loose some of the capacity of the battery.

These are the full review for these MI earbuds S. I hope you like it.",4

However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.
I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.

7225,Worst Autofocus System In This DSLR,"This Camera is the King of Budget segment Cameras.
This camera gives you excellent results only if you know how to use a dslr.
The 55-250 lens is more reliable than 18-55.
To reduce the focusing noise use stm or usm lens.
Build quality is mind blowing..
Used the camera for 1 year and is extremely Satisfied.
Best camera for beginners and for others you can use this as a secondary camera.
Battery life is decent.
For New users who are not excellent in manual mode can approach youtube and learn the basics.
Other modes are not useful.Use Av,Tv,M modes for photography.
Video quality is poor as this is not a video camera.
The Wifi Feature is handy and makes transfering of images quick.
50mm Lens suits excellent for the camera.

7189,Very good product,"The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.
Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices.. Canon1500D has a superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus. Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .

Compatible with both my laptop and phone.

Many reviews told that ot was tight and had to do something to loosen up. But I find it most comfortable. You might experience a little pain in ear if you use it for long hours (like more than 6 hours continuously) in beginning. But I don't have that issue anymore.

I don‚Äôt gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you‚Äôre addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be.

2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage.
3. Sound is loud.

Cons:-
1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ‚Çπ1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you.
2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold.

Build: 2.5/5 (It's build didn't seem that tough),
Bass: 4/5 (seems like bass is not natural),
Clearness in sound: 3/5 (extra or over of bass spoils the sound),
Length of wire: smaller as compared to other earphones,
Quality: 3/5 (doesn't seem premium)

There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.

I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!

Pros:
1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor
2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal
3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud
4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!

Cons:
1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging
2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate

13592,Could be way better,Only display 500w motor but inside 300w motor . Very very cheating,2
6194,Waste...cheap materials used,"Firstly, Thanks to Amazon and the concerned dealer for their prompt actions...

However, the first piece had turned out to be faulty...the coil burnt in third-fourth use.....The mixer was immediately replaced by Amazon....The smallest jar of the replaced mixer seems to have a design/manufacturing fault, it makes abnormally loud noise and seems unsafe so cannot be used....the middle size jar seems to be functioning fine...however, this is an issue of concern....",1
3969,Worst Printer HP/Amazon,"Spent money in thousand but could not print even 10 pages, frustrating ....forget colour it can't get a Black n white print properly worst buy ever.

Print quality is total disaster.",1

16746,Nice product,"The four stars are for 1st excellent vocals(as good as headphones), 2nd good ear grip, 3rd the mic is with the right cable (separate from the multifunction button) which leads to quality calls without efforts and 4th good quality cable (not tangle free but still)
And the only problem is built quality (it may be okay for many users as per the price but it should be more premium ).
Hope this will help you.",4
2167,iOS users gotta accept it‚Äôs iPhone 11.,"Nothing to dislike about the product and seller.

Security: I only hope that apple will come up with an iOS update to add option for those wanting to disable swipe after the phone is unlocked with Face ID.

Camera quality: Could see visible grains in photos taken even during daylight as compared to the photos taken from iPhone 5s even though it‚Äôs without crisp details. iPhone 11 boasts of camera features, else the picture quality isn‚Äôt impressive. Video quality is good though.

Battery: It‚Äôs not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly. So, it will go about an entire day in moderate usage without much to play.

Voice assistant: Siri is few seconds slower to respond to ‚ÄòHey Siri.‚Äô

Sound: Sounds good while watching videos. Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom. Use EarPods/AirPods for the better.

Overall, it‚Äôs a good buy in 2020 with not much to bargain for what you pay.",5

1284,Big Fan ‚ù§Ô∏è,"Amazing product. It's so light in weight that doesn't even feel anything when weared. Classy case with high end look. Great highs and lows with good base.

2169,Prestigious and worthy which I needed.,"An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.
During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am. And also got it same at my residance with very speedily on 18th in safe n superb packing.
But after inserting sim card i hv noticed that incoming call ringer volume was not working, i hv contacted APPLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM, they tried to resolve the problem, through screen sharing, they hv tried, there level the best, but couldn't get successed and saying that this is product manufacturing defect and advised to contact apple service centre, with sending me a (service centre) link, which was 400km away from my residence.i explained my inability to opt it, hence he advised to contact AMAZON from which it was purchased .

Then i hv contacted AMAZONE, customer service centre, described all these, then via via via an authorised executive talked with me, explaining all the details and requested to help me out. He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards. I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period i hv purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)
Otherwise I could purchased iphone 11 from apple store, it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.
After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)
Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a cutomer of AMAZONE.
If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not be possible for replacement.
Salute to AMAZONE. I AM HIGHLY OBLIGED.

Migrating data is simple from android to IOS. But migrating what's app data should be done through purchased 3rd part software. Phone consumes lots of internet compared to android.

The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won‚Äôt be running normally or the video quality won‚Äôt be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.
Pros:
Battery
Camera
Display
Processor

Cons:
The charger provided is only of 5W.

Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there‚Äôa a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don‚Äôt know how).

If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2.

But this issue is still there... First earbuds worked perfectly for 6 days and left earbud stopped working jn middle of a movie and stopped charging also...
So i ordered the replacement at the 9th day of replacement window (Thank god), recieved the second earbud. In the second earbud, left one charged and turned on properly but no sound from it...
Immediately returned it :-(

Gets disconnected and needs to pair everytime we switch of/on bluetoth on phone. Most importantly doesn't display notifications for SMS messages and you need to agree sending the SMS messages to some china server even to get notifications which is absolute crap..

Have to say the freesync feature can't be switched on, I think it can be enabled only if you have a graphic card. Also I noticed there are some light bleeding issues along all the edges when I turn on the screen. But it is only visible when the screen is black, so it won't be affecting that much for a normal user. But in case if you work on black background a lot, then it might be disturbing. None of the above issues bothered me since I use it for only streaming movies, so I would say overall it's a very good product.",4

The battery life is decent and they have decent bass however it does justify the price point. The fitting is nice and fits perfectly and does not fall off from the ears. Battery life is acceptable 2.30 to 3 hrs in one charge on high volume while listening to music. I‚Äôm sure it will last long if only used for calls. The charging case is also very compact and easily fits the pocket. I had no issues connecting with my iphone 8 plus and my laptop. The range is decent at 10-15 feet post which it looses connection.

8237,Garbage product,"if ur looking for a monitor this monitor is best under 10k for both gaming and color grading. i have been using this monitor for 10 days now, and here is my review with some tips for better experience.
1. the panel quality is really great for the price (Factory Calibrated colors) colors are spot on with great viewing angles
2. bezel less design looks really good
3. build quality is good, but the stand quality is just decent it wobbles
4. It comes with HDMI cable so this monitor has a headphone jack too for ur speakers or headphones
5. Some people complaint about white glow visible when viewing something black on screen, it is not a product issue at all it happens with all ips displays on higher end monitors it is less visible, and u will only notice this when the display is showing only black color

TIPS AND TRICKS
1. Better Colors - This display comes with black stabilizer (Gaming Feature) turn that to 0/off cause it makes blacks a bit greyish so for better colors turn that off
2. Avoid Screen Flashing - Sometimes the monitor automatically Lowers the brightness which causes screen flash to avoid this go to monitor settings and turn off smart energy saving
3. Unlock 75hz - To unlock 75hz, turn on free sync from monitor menu or via the the lg desktop app and set the response time to faster, then (if u have win 10) right click on desktop and go to display settings>Advanced display settings>Display adapter properties> go to monitor tab and select 75hz and press ok. after that go to nvidia or amd graphic control pannel and see if 75hz is selected if not, then select 75hz and enjoy",1

I contacted Apple customer care and they confirmed that the device was used before to create other apple ids. They said this error comes only if the phone is refurbished or used as a demo phone.
Also i would like to highlight, amazon and apple have a tie up and if you need to replace a iphone purchased from amazon,you have to go to their store physically and get a job sheet from apple. In my case, when i approached apple for the job sheet they deleted the phone‚Äôs history from their end and said that there wasnt any issue with the phone. the previous error(screenshot) vanished and i could successfully create a new id with that phone.

1091,"Original, good quality wireless earphones.","Its a new launch and I got it for my wife's Redmi Note 4 but it should pair with any Bluetooth phone..

The case has 300Mah battery which is good enough and charges earphones when they're inside storage case. The case has a MicroUSB charging point, but no cord is supplied in the package. Red means charging is going on. A white (or off) light while charging means full charge is done.

Both earphones have one multipurpose button which is used for accepting, rejecting call and play/ pause music among other things.

First time pairing is very easy, no passcodes. Take out earphones, switch on BT and discover and pair them.
Then on, you connect by only taking out the earphones from the case. Inside case, the earphones switch off BT. Single earphone mode is also there if you remove one earphone only from the case.

The package has Charging case, 2 earphones, 3 sets of rubber earplugs with M size installed, and user guide.

I'll write my review pointwise about the earphones' working:-
1. Very comfortable in ears, very light too,
2. There's no perceptible difference between Left and right channel, both play with Stereo, without delay in equal volume,
3. There's a very slight delay between audio and video when watching videos or playing games, this can be further removed by engaging Gaming mode, then it becomes ok,
The delay is ok for movies, you might not even feel the delay. Its like 0.1 seconds or so I think in normal usage.

Negatives:
1. Mic is a bit far, but for real life it works nicely. Voice is loud and clear in normal calls,
2. you can't use the mic for recording video/audio, its only for calls, so far what I've noticed, but it could be a software thing too with our phone which has very old software, not updated.

Now coming to sound quality. Due to senior bluetooth air pods (Rs. 4500~) in market, I didn't have much expectations from sound quality of this junior Redmi S earphones, but this was a little surprise, the quality is actually ok for the typical music fan, who's not a die hard audiophile...
If you listen to music while travelling, or casually, once in a while, you're going to be very satisfied with the audio quality. Maximum volume is just right, it can get loud, keep it at 80%.

If you're an audiophile, let me put it in your terms, the lower(bass) and upper (treble) frequencies are slightly higher, and the midrange frequencies are weaker... Be prepared for louder hissing sort of sounds in treble frequencies. Stereo separation is ok, but the dynamic range itself is not too high. Distortion is as such not noticeable to the common ear.
Comparing to wired earphones, the quality is better than Mi earphones basic (Rs. 400), but not better than Mi Dual Driver earphones (costing Rs. 799) or Rs. 699 ones either.
Overall, they're good for calls and general listening, like audio lectures and so. Its not a serious tool for an audiophile, but have average expectations and they'll do good.

Ask questions in comments and I'll answer if I get notification of this...",5

While I was searching, I found that in comparison from others, more people have bought this particular one. I don't know if they are also facing the same problem.

26,Too Tight on the Ears,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.
The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).
After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).
So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.

2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight.",2

But after using 9-10 times it work well but I agree with the fact that material quality is average and even not too good but if someone Handel with care it work good and last long life.,1
3155,Cheap price but heavy maintenance....think twice before purchasing,"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty",3

Now come to the phone-

I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product.

The service was delayed i asked the engineer he said due to covid many complaind are there so it may be dealyed.,5

332,Complete Review after usage of a week,"First of all, it is worth its price, i got this at 599 which is ok for it.
I had a great experience listening to songs with it. Before buying, i read some reviews here mentioning i causes ear pain and is tight. But let me tell you, i have not experienced it till now. It is ok for about 30 minutes continuous usage as i already told it is for those people who listen songs for about half an hour. For movies and all, i had my earphones which came with my phone.
Honestly speaking, my experience with it is excellent and average both depending on thw music i am listening. Bass is also like that. It is just outstanding sometimes and good on few occasions but not bad at any time.
Sound quality is damn good.
It is adjustable so if u feel uncomfortable, just adjust it according to ur head shape.
It is foldable too and build quality looks good too. Also doesn't makes any sound while adjusting or folding.
Overall i am impressed with this product.
And yes as it is bass focused headphone , it sometimes compromise in sound quality but is around 1 or 2 times out of 10. So it is ok.
But at this price, it is ok.
Completely worth the money.
I am continuosly listening to music since 7 days and i feel awesome everytime i plug it in.
As i wrote this long long review, it is understood that i liked this so much and it is a good product and i should be known to others too.",5

Gets disconnected and needs to pair everytime we switch of/on bluetoth on phone. Most importantly doesn't display notifications for SMS messages and you need to agree sending the SMS messages to some china server even to get notifications which is absolute crap..

425,Boat Bassheads 900,"So it's been more than a year since i bought this great value for money headphones.
After using it for so long, I'll state the Pros and Cons for this product.
Pros:
Sound Quality and Bass are on point
Sturdy Build Quality,It's build to last
Easy to handle and carry.

Cons:
The only con i found associated with bassheads 900 is that it's not suitable for long periods of usage. As after an hour my ears start to hurt.",5

7120,"Amazing clearity, original image without effects","Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money",5

5467,But delivery is too slow,I purchased 64 GB. Memory card in sale 1100 with adeptor,5
7179,Go to for beginners,"For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it‚Äôs just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.
It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.",5

So, choose an ear tip correctly, sometimes picking a one that is not part of the OEM pack; buy separately.

2. Combined with AMD Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 6GB DDR6 Graphics and Corsiar 3000mhz 16GB DDR4 RAM with GSync I get more than 80 FPS on Ultra settings at 1080p in Games like The WItcher 3, Hitman 2, Batman Arkham Knight.......planning to test it with more latest games like Red Dead Redemption 2.

Cons: I found only one. You will need to calibrate the screen color. It had a little greenish tone with default settings (Your experience might be different depending on your configuration).
But not a big thing, understanding the monitor controls and adjusting the screen setting took me around 5 minutes.

Overall Great Performance Monitor for gaming. If you are on tight budget go with it !!

BTW I bought it for 8499, the price is now increase to 10k. Don't know why.",3

Battery backup is more than decent, since the unboxing it went good for 5 straight days with 88% charge. BP and SPo2 tracking is good and trust worthy.

Eleventh generation chip has 3.8 GB graphics that is sufficient for day 2 day work and edit. The trackpad is flimsy but strangely very accurate and gets the job done.,1

256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.

Cons
A little reflective screen.
No DVD drive.
Both the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .
Type C USB connector is on left hand side.

For the price this is a value for money camera.

This is a very portable camera. With time you can upgrade your lenses.

If you're are really into photography or want to explore it with a minimal budget this should be your purchase

So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures.

53,Not very reliable after some time,"Headphones have become quite the necessity in these pandemic days of online existence. Whilst they might look sturdy, the majority of them end up looking the worse for wear because of the constant use and contact with sweat. they also develop all kinds of problems, such as the sound coming only through one ear, or crackling, sooner rather than later. No headphone of mine, irrespective of price, has survived for more than two years. This one was also no different. Had to discard it after two years because the sound stopped coming. Before that, there was an odd problem where the head phone took over the YouTube controls and the video would start and stop randomly. Battery life wasn't also all that great.",3

7140,My first DSLR,"Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.

I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.

We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.

Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue.",4

I received a apple factory sealed package.

But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.

Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.",4

7441,Very very value for money,I am beginner in using DSLRs and I really liked this in terms of photo quality & ease of use(after going through few online videos).,5
5062,Perfect performance to cost option for pro cameras,"Good enough for writing raw files with high end cameras. - I can vouch for up to 24-30 mpx files. Even bursts/brackets of 3-4 exposures is fine. If you are shooting sony A7r series or medium format, and use lot of burst shooting/bracketing, then I am not sure if it'll keep up.
On my Fuji XT2 - wih 24 mpx raw files it mostly works quite well. When I try to do focus bracketing (7-8 shots) it can take a little time to save. You might miss some shooting opportunities in such cases, but it is rare, as you will typically be using focus bracketing and such techniques only for situations such as landscapes which call for more deliberate and slow approach. Still, if this is important, go for UHS-II.
For most people though, this is a great cost to performance ratio. After this, the price increases quite sharply. Also note currently (as of Nov 2019) this extreme series 128 GB card has been updated more recently than the extreme pro counterpart, and is actually slightly faster (strange but true). Once the extreme pro line is updated, it will obviously be even faster. Please read online reviews before buying if this review is dated by then.
Also, go for the 128 gb instead of the 64 gb because the 64Gb has a slower write speed. the increase in price is worth it both for the extra storage and the extra speed.",4

Very delighted by asthetics and performance.
Although battery life is still an issue I get 1 n half day with regular usage. I doubt over the years it will degrade.

Otherwise s20plus is good alterantives",5

8319,Awesome product. Value for money,"UPDATED REVIEW:
I have been using this monitor for almost 3 years and now it has a red horizontal line on the display. Although the line is very thin and unobtrusive, it is easy to see to the naked eye on a grey background. The red line indicates that the panel / display is about to die.

Fortunately, LG offers 3 year warranty for this product and this issue popped up 10 days before the end of the warranty period (Thank God!). After a quick chat with the LG customer care, they had sent a technician to my house and within 3-4 days, they replaced the display of this monitor. Don't know if the display will die soon but I did get a full replacement like they promised and I am happy about it.

Nevertheless, I expected a LG monitor to work flawlessly for at least 5 years. Hope the new display does not die soon as I really love this monitor. For now, it is as good as new.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD REVIEW: Absolutely Gorgeous! One of the best deals out there. Paid Rs 80 extra for 2 day delivery, but the Packaging was mind blowing. The brightness sometimes feels high, but easily adjustable. Picture quality is amazing. Could've added more Tilt, I guess. It's a perfect monitor for gaming and content creation.",5

2373,Excellent phone (even in comparison to iphone 12 when you consider the price.),"I got it for 48.5k (128 GB version) and at this price point its a an excellent product (compare it with oneplus 9 but will beat it on performance, longevity and camera from in case if these are your priorities). Its a real value for money when compared to iphone 12 mini (upwards of 65K+ for 128GB but smaller battery) and iphone 12 (80k+ for 128GB variant). You wont miss much on camera and performance front. True that the new boxy design is sexier and the screen has improved. But the premium you have to pay is too big (around 20k).
P.S: I would strongly suggest to go for 128 GB version irrespective of the version of iphone. 64GB is too less and you will start to encounter space issues within six months or so (if you are a casual user).",5
1503,Yet another Value for Money product by Xiaomi,Only credible and branded wireless earbuds available under 2k. Have been waiting for this product since it was launched in China. Sound is amazing (did not expect such sound in a low value product). Fit in the ear is great and they are small and very compact. Connectivity is seamless. No 'jhanjhat' of connecting every time you get a call. Battery life could have been better but cannot complain at this price.,5

Of course, the built is great and seems to be very strong but trust me, a reckless user like me got lured by its design and build and ended up in disappointment.
I am disheartened that I wasted money on these as I thought these wired earphones would be a great choice for someone who is way too lazy to charge the wireless ones.

18839,Decent Product,"Pros:
1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot

Cons:
1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time
2. Makes lot of noise while printing.

Verdict:
You can use this product only for printing and copying. If you are specific about scanning, dont buy this product. The Scanner driver is a big crap

About Flipkart delivery:
Flipkart delivered me MG2400 instead of 2470. By look both will be same. but 2400 is cheper than 2470. So guys, note down the model no when you get the product
I later called flipkart and raised a request for return. Again they took a weeks time to deliver

8210,Not original Quality,"At first I didn't like the monitor coz it had backlight bleeding issues and also it had an dead pixel on right top corner, i was worried. After that I spoke with the customer care and they easily replaced the product, the second one came and I was fascinated that it didn't have any faults, the picture quality was great and it serves my purpose well. I do gaming casually not high but like moderately and watch movies and I also do designing using cad softwares so for all this the color reproduction is quite good and for @7k what can I expect more, completely satisfied with the product.

cons: texts are sometimes harder to read and for high end gaming go for better monitors.",2

2124,"Yes, it‚Äôs a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn‚Äôt up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung‚Äôs A 30‚Äôs which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..

Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can‚Äôt help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.

Sound & Call Quality also Network

Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!

Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.

Camera:
The Live Photo‚Äôs with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn‚Äôt take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P

1. It would be good if it had two hdmi ports.
2.I had some minor artifacts show up in 900p resolution, you can turn on gpu scaling in your computer to resolve it but at the cost of added input lag and some performance drop which isnt favourable for esports title like csgo and valorant which many of us play at lower resolutions for extra frames.",5

6145,Worst product not worth buying,I had a very bad experience with this product. Ordered this after seeing lot of reviews but worst product have ever seen. First of all packing was very bad which shows they do not care about the product safety. And coming to product the mixer shakes like a hell when started which scare us whether it will blast when started and the noise is like from number of vehicles on the road. As you see in the picture the mixer jar is tightly getting attached to the mixy rotating clip when used and the heat is too high. I was very frustrated after using this on the first use and wasted lot of time in ordering Amazon. It surprises that a brand company do not care about quality and it was completely looks like they sent a used product. Amazon should look and take proper action for sending these kind of products but when complained same to customer care they apologise and say we do not repeat it in future nothing more than that.,1

Earlier I have used unknown brand but product working better than PRESTIGE.... this mixer grinder is useful... 750 watt but not getting fine grinding at all. So I suggest don't go with the brand mixer grinder... 1200-1500/- mixer grinder work better than PRESTIGE 3000/- mixer grinder. I have started using late otherwise I could go for refund!!,5
12603,Moderate,Bad,2
6561,Poor quality and durability,"This product doesn't grind spices properly , its taking a lot of time to grind and I still dont know why the mixer grinder has become Amazon's choice. They have cheated us saying it does tough grinding but it doesn't do. Dont buy. I simply wasted Rs. 2800/-",1
1035,Right bud not working after 1 month!!!!,"Update: The right earbud is not working at all after a month. I can't get it to work. I have to file for a warranty replacement. It stopped working so suddenly. I had not been using it for a week and when I picked it up to listen it just wouldn't pair or turn or. No lights.

Please do not buy this if reliability is your criteria.

It looks like true wireless earbuds have finally reached the price point of wired earbuds from 5 years ago.

My only requirement was for workouts. Ordered yesterday and they were delivered today. I think it was less then 12 hours since my order. I can't believe how fast Amazon delivery is.

Took them out for an hour long bicycle ride. These were my first impressions

1. They stay in your ear and seal it well regardless of what you're doing. After sometime you would forget they're there.
2. Quite comfortable even with sweating. I may have adjusted it a few times to reseal the ear. Overall they serve the purpose of workout earbuds extremely well.

Sound quality
1. Mediocre at best. I didn't expect them to sound excellent (considering what I paid) but they sound quite decent.
2. Boomy bass, recessed mids and soft highs.
3. I listened to an audiobook while cycling and a few tunes. Was impressed with what I could hear. Mind you, when working out, you aren't concentrating on music. And the workouts keep changing the seal of the earbuds causing a sort of going in and coming out of water sound effect (I'm not sure if people can understand this sound effect- imaging putting your head under water and taking it out - the way the sound changes that's what it felt like for every bump in the road during cycling - I'm sure joggers will face this too)
4. Noise isolation was decent when the buds sealed the ear, but since the ear canal shape changes during constant motion of workout, the noise isolation only worked if I pushed them in a little more. I did have to increase the volume during traffic to hear what was playing (only did this for testing-i don't recommend increased volumes)
5. Was able to hear everything clearly at less than half the volume on phone. Didn't test maximum loudness.

Build and other considerations:
1. Very sturdy build quality.
2. Buttons are tactile and give good feedback.
3. Controls could have been more intuitive but nothing you can't get used to.
4. Case is very nice for storing and charging. Has indicators on the case and the buds themselves to show charging and pairing.
5. Loved the automatic pairing when taken out of case and press the button for music. Couldn't get any easier.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied. I have not tested battery life yet. It's only been 3 hours since delivery. Haven't tested call quality as well.

I would recommend this to people looking for cheap workout buds that won't fall of their ears. People looking for best sound quality, look elsewhere.",1

build quality 3.5 * bcoz white is not so attractive silver would be better

battery life 4 *
charging speed 1* bcoz of 5 watt gandu charger
use 12w adapter from apple dont buy 18 or 20 it will impact on battery health draning due to heating so for long use use 12 w adapter from apple

first apple product i used many android phones

Pros:
1.good battery backup. Lasts upto 3 hrs with 80% volume!!!
2.Sound quality is good enough and is having more focus on vocals than music. This helps in calls and other videos like movies, reviews etc.

Cons:
1. Bass is not high and more like plain earbuds.
2. No volume increase or decrease or track change on earbuds.

Finally upon contacting the Apple customer care, they advised to take it nearest Apple service centre. The service centre was reluctant asking to contact amazon, as it was bought from amazon. The service centre guys mentioned that they have had many such compliants with regards to issues with iPhones delivered from amazon! Hope you guys are not delivering substandard and poor quality phones under the guise of discounted products!

102,Honest Review after speculating,"I am writing this review after looking over these headphones properly. In this price range, You can't expect to get more. If you are a school student or college student, then go for it. Though, yes the sound quality is not as good as i expected, but still it's not a huge difference. I switched from boat bassheads 225 that's why I had some problems with sound. As for the comfort, I saw many reviews saying that these are not comfortable, well to me, they are really really comfortable, you have to notice how you are wearing them.
Overall, these Headphones are amazing, if your budget is lower than 1000rs., Go for it.",5
7586,Nice Camera,The camera itself is awesome. I liked the interface for canon cameras. The only con i found was regarding the auto focus. It has got only 9 auto focus point but manual focusing can be easily done. Beginner just go for it.,4
7655,Best quility,Picture clarity is ok but colour tone of a picture with any/every settings is worst than my smart phone.,5
15940,Very Good,"Really a nice piece... after trying earphones from THE FAMOUS flipkart smart buy earphone and Boat product in the approximately similar price range( a lill costlier than this), I would declare this as a clear winner.. For some limitations, I feel the design does not look very great for me and you might have a hard time in adjusting the buds in your ear. But when it comes to sound quality, clarity and the bass, it stands tall..
So if you are looking something under 500 rs., I would say, this should be your pick!!",4
64,One of the wow products,"Just wow product. I just starting using it however it has amazed me in every way.

The camera is good - only for new comers into photography.. If you‚Äôre a photographer who does paid shoot or is interested in various amounts of genre in photography then I suggest to go with a lil high budget of another camera. This camera is good only with 50MM lens.. if you click pictures with the 18-55 MM lens then you are gonna definitely face issues with Noise in the picture.. same if you use 55-250 there is a high chance if getting shaken images also adding noise into it..if u have budget issues and are very good with post processing skills then you can go for it or else not..

Cons:
1. Very few dials UI

But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured!

Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight. The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.",4

Mic\call quality is awesome at this price range. Main point is before attending the call, you need to adjust earbud to outside little bit.. because MIC position went inside to the ear, if you wear it like songs hearing position. (This is reason many of the reviews are bad related to call quality)
(You should concentrate on MIC position before calling for better call quality)

Perfect fit in ears and creates vacuum in ears
Connecting time with the paired device (2-3 sec).
Bit difficult in taking the buds out of the case because of design flaw.

If you keep the buds in your pocket and walk you will hear a sound coming out of the case as the buds are little bit loose inside the case.

Overall, the product is more than average and is good for listening music and indoor calling's...",5

2345,First time apple user & as secondary phone to one and only Nokia - Read full review,"First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.
Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,
Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.
Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.
After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.
Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.
Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested.
Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price.
IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.",4

With just INR 200 it gives bluetooth, removable aux(that way if the wire is damaged it can be replaced), feels tight(in a good way).

8133,Great value for money!,"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.

Pros:
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.

Cons:
1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.
2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.

Two things to take note of:
A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowing
B. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.

All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.",5

Amazed with the audio clarity and back up time.
They are small and light. We also get couple of ear tips to suit your ears. Earbuds sits perfect with no chances of it dropping.
Pairing is simple just remove from case and start to pair. It can be used with single bud also but to get true effect both must be used..
Easily should be able to get 3 and half hours + back up with one charge , volume with less than 50% is quite loud.
Buds when placed inside the box switches off and gets charged. Case can be charged with micro USB cable.
Call quality is great
Buds can also be powered off with long press

Buds to be placed properly in ear, do look for left and right, or else the sound quality gets poor exact placement will make it hear more n more or else you will hate and be sure with couple of tries you will get the exact placement.
Micro USB cable for charging, cable not included

Cons
Charging case lid looks a bit fragile hope it stays

Cons
1. Frequently turns to Mono mode from stereo

Later when lockdown was over I went to apple service center and I heard shocking news about my adaptor the Resq (apple has tie-up with reliance to support apple)executive told me that the adaptor is fake one and he can not replace it. Another sock came after I checked my case id online where the executive did not mentioned that he can not provide replacement because I have fake product instead what he wisely canceled my appointment. So guys there is big scam going on apple support is not interested to fix smal issue the user has to bear all the charges for the same.,1

11317,Hated it! Pathetic service!!!,"The sound quality is pretty nice and bass is good too.

I'd have rated this atleast 4 if there was a peace of mind owning a product from this brand. I bought this product and used it like for 3 months and then the right channel and the mic stopped working. I had then claimed for warranty and it looks like the support team of Boult is least bothered to respond to emails.
They got no seriousness to look at the customer satisfaction. They even closed the ticket without resolving the issue which is quite surprising on how these guys respond.

The only reason for buying this product was to know the reliability factor and the quality to upgrade to a higher end product from Boult. Now that I lost the trust factor on this brand, I would never ever look for buying an other product from Boult.",1

Update to previous comment, although microphone did fail however the level of support and the ease of simply sitting at home and getting it repaired was great.

So any one needs a great sound quality with affordable price earphone for 5 months time .It's the best earphone at this price.
But if you need some durability and also equally good quality sound then go for MI basic earphone. why I suggest MI basic model earphone is because I got both the earphones at the same time but MI still the best after 1year at the same time period I already used two Boult audio earphones(Best sound quality but not durable).",4

Write speed using USB A: The write speed was consistent around 16-17 MBps for the entire duration.

Read speed using USB C: About 140-142 MBps for the entire duration.

Read speed using USB A: About 145-150 MBps for the entire duration. Yes, this was higher... checked twice.

Now I found the reason why hp is buying this good printer for low price, if you want to print pictures this is just a scam. If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing.",2

1. Starting with built quality, I assure you will get the best premium feel.
2. Camera is just awesome,rare and front both.
3. If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.
4. The face id works butter smooth.
5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.
6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.
7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.
8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.
9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.
10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation",5

2230,Dissappointing hardware!,"I have been using 6s for past ~5yrs and made an economical swicth to Iphone 11, to stick to the simplified OS. For god sake, I could see so many cons in comparison with 6s, regretting my upgrade
1. Heavy!, expected, when I have switched from 6s, but its too heavy when compared to other phones of this size. May the same reason, ip12 is lighter
2. WIFI reception. ip6s did a very good job. almost at every part of my house, it was able to gather good signal. but ip11 literally struggles to even stay connected with WIFI at corners. it makes continuous switch between WIFI/cellular, annoys to to move to a different location. tried even with out the cover on.
3. Speakers at the bottom. I was thinking both the grill openings at the bottom were speakers. it turned out, i could hear music from only one of them. even i have planned to visit apple care to get the mobile checked. had some instinct to check it online before going, by then i was able find in apple discussions, that its microphone with speaker like grill.
4. Sound output - both through wired/wireless headphones. i could not hear anything in an crowded environment. even tried with multiple good earphones, the output is very low. this even a low end phone can do a better job. this might force me to move to a new phone may be.
And most imp is the call history, you cannot have more than 100 call records.. not sure, why apple have this policy. you gonna really miss some imp numbers, when we really get busy with continuous calls. And you cannot record your voice calls, when it‚Äôs really needed like in other ecosystem!
Feel, these are very basic setback to even consider it as a good phone. would definately not recommend anyone for ip11, rather would recommend ip12(if one can afford) or ip6s, if they could find in second hand market.(Yes, the size is small, but that does a better job). Even the former one, I'm not sure, as I haven't used hands-on.",2

2160,Premium phone with okay discounts from HDFC.,"Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.
Pros:
1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.
2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?

Cons:
1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.
2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.
3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.
4. Read the terms and conditions of
Apple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance.",5

One earbud stops working completely and doesn't even charge when put in case. In my case, it has happened for both Left and Right earbuds in last 10 days. Took to mi service center twice and I am told that this is a known issue. They somehow reset the earbuds and they start working again, but it is a hit and trial method and doesn't rectify the issue. They even refused to replace the earbuds, as they somehow reset it everytime and returned in working condition.

How to reset: Clean the charging points on earbuds and the case. Put the case on charging and only place the earbud which is not working. Long press the multifunction button on earbuds. If you are lucky, the red light will be turned on. Give it a couple of tries if doesn't work at once.

Disclaimer: The above hack was told by a service centre executive and holds no guarantee to rectify the inherent issue.

Advice would be not to buy this product. Instead go for a slightly higher priced good quality product.",2

The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with. Night Mode is a welcome addition. its good for gaming as well.

- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.
- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.

There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.

The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me.",5

As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre.",1

01. Display: IPS LCD HD+ Koi dikkat nahi karti hai kafi majedar hai colour accuracy bahut badiya hai lekin agar aap OLED display se switch kar rahe ho to thoda sa colours fikke lag sakte hain
True Tone sabse badiya bindass features mainse ek hai apko kabhi bhi apni display ki brightness ko dekhne ki jarurat hi nahi hai ye ambient lighting ke hisab se auto adjust kar leti hai

The sound has also decreased to about half; even full volume now sounds quite low. There are connectivity issues where you have to restart it multiple times to connect both earbuds. The sound is now also uneven in the two earbuds.

1124,Good product for the price point,"I bought this pair of earbuds about two months back and after using it for this duration, I can put forth an honest review of the product.

First thing first, the delivery service of Amazon was quick. The product fits nice in-ear and is very easy to use. The sound quality is decent but during calls sometimes it feels that the voice oscillates from one end to the other (meaning it sounds like mono and then all of a sudden feels like a stereo effect). The noise cancellation is good as I have used many a times while in a moving car and there is clarity of voice. Besides that, the battery life is also good and lasts long.
The flip sides of this product is that at times it becomes very difficult to take out the buds from the case as the lid interfere. In all a good product to have and easy to use.

I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,
It was delivered on time.
There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, in-fact, I am happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.
I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.
This phone is super smooth, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.
Camera is another best thing of iphone 11.
Talking about the design and build quality, it is great. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.
Apple have improved the sound & audio quality as-well. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.
Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer. Highly recommended!",5

Call quality is ok ok and earbuds are lose you need to check if they're charging or not by simply placing in the case the pins didn't align in my case and manget is not strong for connecting pins and the buttons are a bit hard on click.

On the best part it is easy to connect and haven't found any lag on daily usage except gaming. You can use single bud also that's nice and I got 3.5 hours of Play time with buds. On the other side of coin the case looks cheap and felt like it won't last long as plastic is too thin on the opening side and it has micro usb and no fast charge.

I would say it's worth buying at 800-900 if you get best deal at festive season and not worth in the range at1300/-",4

. They are okay for music
. You can watch videos on youtube without any delay in sound
. Battery is normal with playtime of almost 3 to 3 and a half hours
. The ups and downs in the music are clear with instruments heard properly
. They fit properly in ear

Negatives
. The sound gets distorted when the volume is at the max
. Don't like them for games as there is a delay of sound for almost a second
. Low bass as compared to ptron bassbuds
. Noice cancellation is low and the other person can hear the sound of surroundings which is disturbing.

1292,"Overall average product. Compared to this fact, price is high","The audio quality for this earbud is good. I am not a fan of high bass, so what it provide is good for me. It may vary for others.
The noise cancellation on microphone is not good, it picks a lot of background noise and even if there is no background sound, the audio quality on the other side is not crisp.
Another feature which I don't like is disconnecting the buds from phone by placing it inside the charging box. When the charging box does not have any charge, it cannot disconnect the buds.

1012,For music lovers only,"The product is well built and sound quality is also good for music lovers. Bass is loud, highs and lows are also well refined. Creates vaccum in ears if instructions given in guide booklet is followed.
Pairing is slowa and not instant. Takes time in connecting with the paired device (5-6 sec).
Bit difficult in taking the buds out of the case because of design flaw.
Call quality is not good anyways. Person at receiving end will not be able to get clear voice. May complaint about mufflled sound comming.
If you keep the buds in your pocket and walk you will hear a sound coming out of the case as the buds are little bit loose inside the case.

For the same price, Crompton is many times better with premium quality, big strong jars, transparent lids and better grinding performance. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product. For same price Crompton Ameo is a much better buy.

2066,Overall a great phone just not a perfect one.,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:
Pros:
A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]
The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]
Somewhere between great to excellent battery life
The software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC
The phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.

Cons:
Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.
You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.
The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.
And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.

Conclusion with personal thoughts:
Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.",4
8583,Value for money.,"i got a good deal , got it in 6999 RS.

218,Kills your ears.,"Very inappropriate design. They are too small to cover your ears. This makes your ears hurt after using them for barely around 5 minutes. The sound is good but the cons in design outweigh that. Also, not sure, but I think the sound is such that it gives you an earache even on listening to a single song. I've never experienced that with other earphones. I would avoid this product.",1

Antiglare lets you stare at it for as long as you can work. No strain on eyes.

Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.",4

Second, the camera is awesome , pictures come out crisp and clear whatever be the time, night mode works like a gem, the balance it creates between the background and the subject is accurate . It does not over expose anything.
Next is the user experience, after coming from an android device i must say the user experience is very very good. Everything is smooth and crisp without any hiccups.
It is a perfect marriage of software and hardware taking you to a great experience.",5

5957,Features without build quality,"I bought these for full day recording for a travel video. I used a Hero 6 and an external battery pack. After only one day's use (about 7 hours of recording time) I switched the first card out for the second card (despite the 9 hour estimated capacity on the first card [two hours remaining on the card]).

The next morning, when I tried to download the first card, I got continuous SD errors. I was able to recover the video files using the GoPro app, but the video files are corrupted with lots of dropped frames. So basically, just one day into a 10 day trip, I was down to one card. Fortunately the second card worked for the rest of the trip, but required daily downloading.

Given the price of these, and the brand, I expected better.

Once back home, with access to my PC and recovery tools, the only resolution was to format the first disk, which now has 20 GIG of dead space. Not impressed.

UPDATE
I Sent the card into Sandisk for a replacement under a valid RMA from their customer support. The mail tracking says they received the dead card back in March. It's now mid July and as of yet I have still not received the replacement card. Every time I call Sandisk Global Support it's a constant stream of excuses, and false apologies.. While this is not a ""vendor"" issue, you need to keep in mind that, when purchasing this card, manufacturer support (which is all you are left with once you use the card and it fails, sucks... big time.",4

7127,Used before 4 month and Real review for you all you can trust,"Auto focus is not at all perfect.
Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.
While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.
Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.
Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.
Plastic quality is poor.
I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.",4

If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.",5

No complaints though, have been using it for a month now and the performance has been awesome. Cannot compare it to an android. It is a matter of taste/preference and now that I have switched to IOS, I am not willing to leave it and switch back to android. Probably because iOS is pretty simplistic, just the way I like it.

iPhones are not worth 70k I guess but I got it for 53K which is definitely worth it. It is good if you get an iPhone for around 50. Hence I decided to buy this instead of the new 12",5

8181,Review after 3 years. Red horizontal line on display which was replaced by LG.,"For the price, this is an amazing deal. Got it on sale for ‚Çπ7k and I'm very happy with it. It is quite bright, so much so that i barely use it over 80% brightness. The thin bezels give it a very modern look which is awesome. It is good for content consumption, but don't expect to be doing colour accurate editing on this. This monitor is a great all rounder Full HD package.

I gave it a 4 star for the gaming criteria since this monitor isn't built for gaming exactly and it is not going to push anything above 1080p 60FPS because well, those are the specs lol.

The only thing I didn't particularly like about it is the included stand, but this monitor is also VESA compatible so atleast you're not limited to that particular stand, and you can use this monitor in a dual (or more) screen setup however you want. All in all, this is a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it.",3

Talking about pros and cons,
Pros:
. Light weight
. Small in size
. Good battery backup
. Hasselfree connectivity(After first time
connection every time you take them out
of the case they connect automatically)
. After using you don't need to switch them
off just keep them in the case
. Attempted calls many times didn't faced
any issues
. Fits well, comes with eartips of sizes S,M,L

Cons:
. Quality of case aswell as earbuds is decent
not that great but not that bad too
. Sound quality is pretty good, bass is
average but for most of the songs there is
no problem.

Conclusion:
These are the best earbuds you can buy under 2000 (till now).

I noticed write speed was very slow in my modest digital camera. (Not so modest as a Sony RX10 M4 which normally writes almost instantaneously to another Sandisc with the same rating) Tried taking a video which showed up the very slow write speed. Did some speed test with software suggested by Sandisc. This showed how horribly slow this card was and turned out not to be from Sandisc after contacting them. I can use possibly use this card in another device where write speeds are not so critical. Best avoided.,1

2641,Good Buy,"Im writing this review after 1 month 4 days of usage. Im using this typically as a proffessional one. Regarding the battery life iphone 11 is doing exceptionally good. Camera quality is awesome. The speed of the phone is also commendable. The only thing you make sure that u receive genuine product. After buying the item i was afraid seeing so many cclaims that amazon and flipkart selling cloned iphones so i had crosschecked my phone using seriel number, imei, etc. So guys you can surely go for this item in this price range.",5
11907,Not recommended at all,Very bad head set not working in 4months speaker is not working,1
3224,Dissatisfied,"It's jst 4 months that we buyed the product and it is not working.... It was fine till we were using the 1st cartage but after replacing it with a new one it stopped working...
It would be bst if you buy a gud printer spending some 8000 coz it would prove to be useful in long run and the cartage would be less expensive also.. the cartage with this printer is very expensive costing some 1500 for both colour and black&white and 1 cartage hardly print 100-150 pages so we have to change it time to time and it would dry up if we are not using it regularly so total waste of money. It is just wise to buy some gud printer with less price for cartage.‚ò∫Ô∏è",1

2057,Received faulty phone,"Received faulty phone.

Don't buy here, buy from store. I am suffering from a problem with this phone but Amazon is directing me to the iPhone store now rather than return or replacement, so what's the point in purchasing from amazon.",1
2149,Perfect switch from OnePlus || Original Phone,"After 5 years of loyalty towards OnePlus and 8years towards Android, Finally moved to an IPhone after all the intense brainstorming and research and the obvious Skepticism around different news floating around questioning its authenticity.
For me, the seller was Darshita Electronics (All my 8phones to date has come from this seller and all of them were 100% genuine.

About Iphone 11 128GB White, neatly packaged and delivered,
To do's to check if the phone is Original,
1. Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing
2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)
3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei
4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy
5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock
6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides
7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaults

What did I like about this phone?
1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)
2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features
3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""
4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones
5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)
6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective
7. Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online store

What is not present but doesn't make difference?
1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least
2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS15
3. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging
4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fine

Recommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.",5
3116,Good but costly in maintenance,"This product does printing and scanning well. Works as expected. Main problem comes is the ink cartridge. If you shop online original cartridge, it costs ‚Çπ800 and more ( for small black catridge that yields just ~190 pages ). That's more costly if you are taking more print out or copy. If you take less pages and do scan, then this is good for you.",5

Intially the buds worked well for 5-6 hours then started lagging after very seconds, Noise cancellation feature was also not working. I ordered for the replacement which I got next day in the morning.
That day means yesterday it worked well, was not having any problem which the first one had.
But the second day today when I started using it, the right Earbuds doesn't connect to the phone. As displayed in the pictures submitted, the right earpod was not even charging also not even connecting to any of my phones.
Had very much expectations with these cool budget friendly earbuds but it resulted into a total waste of money.

Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",2

15883,Wonderful,"Sound :If you are comparing it to the likes of realme buds2,jbl c150si or senheiser cx 180 in terms of sound quality.It produces a bit scratchy sound(you may not notice if you are not an audiophile).enough bass but not very pleasing,now coming to treble it is very good.you will enjoy playing pubg,cod on this.i know many already use bluetooth ones but they need budget wired headset for gaming.

Comfort: earbud part is light and comfortable for most people.

Build quality: It is good according to price except earbud part feels cheap plastic.
Conclusion: pretty average for music lovers but good for gaming.
Go for it if you get at 299(max:350) else go for realme buds2

If you are heavy gamer then you may need to charge it twice a day , and my suggestion is to get a fast charger in this case as the current 5w charger takes 2-3 hours for a full charge.

17867,Does the job,Good product,3
7144,Not user friendly.,"Let me explain.

Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.

But those are most of its negatives.

The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.

The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).

The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.

You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.

Why is it the best DSLR?
Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.

The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.

With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion.",1

5933,Not satisfied,"i have been buying sandisk for years and they were the best - fast, reliable and excellent value. i have purchases a few sandisk usb flash drives, usb c and usb 3 and they all had one thing in common; highly unreliable and required regular (full formatting) after they for no reason stop copying and make windows crash. i thought i would give this sandisk product one final chance because its from their ""extreme"" range and i hadn't tried the sd cards so i thought benefit of the doubt. right from the packet, it made windows crash - not sure why but after restarting, i put it in saying error and let windows repair it. started copying my music, it was lightning fast - around the 60-70 mbs mark and about 1/3 way through 0! wouldnt respond and crashed windows. so, same process... FULL format and it worked ok but i had moved it to USB 2.0 just to be sure - i simply wanted to copy the files didn't really care about the speed.
put simply, i think i am done with sandisk now - i won't bother returning this now as i have my music on my phone and will leave it at that.
but if you want a micro sd card for regular use or any thing memory/flash related i REALLY advise you NOT to buy sandisk products as they ALL (i have had 4 sandisk flash based drives) and they all exhibit the same behaviour.
if you want very casual use and don't mind the occasional faffing around with formatting and stuff, then i suppose for the money they are OK.
also i have attached the benchmark - no 160mb ANYWHERE - even on the sequential read which is the fastest so i would go so far to say its a lie - same for the 90mb claim. stopped running the test after the sequential as it was known what was to follow with others.",1

So any one needs a great sound quality with affordable price earphone for 5 months time .It's the best earphone at this price.
But if you need some durability and also equally good quality sound then go for MI basic earphone. why I suggest MI basic model earphone is because I got both the earphones at the same time but MI still the best after 1year at the same time period I already used two Boult audio earphones(Best sound quality but not durable).",4

3143,5- point HONEST review.,"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2

2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge.
3. With the power of Apple‚Äôs A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well.

Cons:
1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display.

Noise cancellation is not perfect, but I'm not complaining as I was not looking out for this feature. Works well on all devices.

I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance.
Pros:
8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot.
Light Weight.
I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough.
Boots in less than 10 seconds
Windows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus too
Cons:
The looks are pathetic.
The display is very very very BAD
Plastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.

If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study.

Anti-glare: Does a decent job. At least in indoor lighting conditions. I've tried keep the window opposite to my workstation open. It glares, as you'd expect. However, I can't ask for more from a monitor this cheap.
Not a gamer, can't say much about gaming.

Small features that I needed but you may not care about: thin bezels, presence of both HDMI and
VGA ports.

Overall, not the best monitor I've used. However, I received it for 7.8k INR. Which, given how good it is, is a steal. Can't ask more from a monitor this cheap.",5

2582,Honest review why should you buy this.üôÇ,"As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in üì∑ competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options. Like that in INDIA didn't expect 5G till 2023 so that's why.

Thank you üòä

Cons:

It is a good product by Boat. Some big issues are also there. My watch going restart again and again when i open their App. Because when it start to synchronize the watch is switching off and then on automatically. I think it is the main issue that must be solve. Another issue is i noticed that whenever this watch arriving in sale after that boat is giving you new clock styles which is still low in amount so why boat not giving or updating new style after certain time. SpO2 sensor is not giving proper reading though, so please keep in mind that don't think this results are actual or don't take results in real time. If you have doubt about oxygen level please go to nearby clinic and go through treatment. Stay safe.",4

87,Conparitively good sound quality,"It has a good sound quality for its price of Rs 800. This was my first ""headphone"" so it did taught me a few things. So lets talk about them, the only deal breaker for me was its comfort as it is an on ear headphone it does feel a lot uncomfortable even if you wear it for just 1 hour. It have realise after using these headphones that i hate on-ear headphone and *comfort is far more important aspect to consider than the sound quality* (at least for me).If you are planning to use your headphone for long hours then I don't recommend this headphone to you. If you want a comfortable headphone there are very few options at this price range, you could go for a gaming headphone as they are very comfortable due to their over the ear design if you can't extend your budget.
(I bought them in November 2018 and I did replaced them once after a year and half due to some audio issue)
Comfort - 2/5
Sound quality - 3.5/5

1120,SPECIFICALLY FOR GAMING REVIEW (PUBG),"This is specifically for people wondering if these earphones will work for PUBG mobile.
The answer is ""NO"".
*I faced latency on my Moto G5s. This might be because my Bluetooth version is 4.2 but i do have aptx on my phone.
*You might face less latency on better phones but if you have a low end mobile phone please do not consider buying them for gaming.
*The other problem being the quality of sound in the game. The earphones loudness and sharpness affects the gameplay majorly. Its not very easy to recognise footsteps or even direction of bullet fire.
OTHER THAN GAMING ITS GREAT IN EVERY ASPECT.",3

However speaking about battery. I never came across a situation where I had to plug it in since normal anyone will not continuously use it instead they keep it back in the case.

And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It‚Äôs been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can‚Äôt beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.",4
12011,Horrible,Worst! Didn't even work for a month and doesn't have warranty for atleast 6 months. Worst piece at this price. Very poor experience.,1
18841,Better not to buy.,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy.
Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day.",2

2063,Best thing that money can buy,"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!",5

5998,"Blades broke, lid won‚Äôt stay keeps popping - poorest quality grinder","I love these micro SD cards; and have purchased at least 20 of them over the last several years. I only use them for my cameras. When full I keep them as back ups of the photos I've taken. Until now I've never had an issue with them, however on returning from a month long Camps International adventure my daughter asked me to download the images from her water camera. She'd been swimming with dolphins and done other underwater activities, which she'd videoed using the water camera.

We've had 2 water cameras now and both have had a problem with respect to removing micro SD cards from the slot they usually reside in. It turned out that removing the card from the camera left the micro SD card (a 32 GB one) cracked. As it is a monolithic storage device, the data within the device has been lost forever.

We took it to a reputable recovery service, who checked it over and announced that it was beyond recovery. If we had been able to recover it, it would have cost around ¬£500. Large cards would cost significantly more.

I'm happy with my cards, but never realised how fragile they were, which is why i've posted this here as a warning to anyone who uses micro SD cards. Keep them in proper storage cases and when removing them from your camera, be very careful.",1

3257,Printer review,"Not so worth buying this printer, print quality is good, but the cartridge of this printer is very small and as they say on website that the cartridge can print 165 pages, it's just to fool the people for buying the product, actually the print is only of 45 pages only.

2384,Review after 1 week of use,"I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.

The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.

This is a great phone with minimal flaws.
The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark rooms

The small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don‚Äôt have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.

The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product‚Äôs like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.
Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.

If you‚Äôre looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.

Blindly don't buy this mixer as it is cheap.
I purchased due to low cost. I m writing cons first as you must read first.
CONS:
1. Mixer quality is bad. All plastic components.
2. Motar sound is very high(noisy).
3. Bad smell coming from mixer after 2 or 3 times of use.
4. Jar quality also bad, seems stainless steel but it is bending when you hold jar tightly.
5. Finishing of jars are not good.

PROS:
The one and only advantage is light weight üòÇ.
So please don't buy this prestige iris mixer.",1

2508,Switched from a 6S,"Not much has changed. Apple has similar products but then obviously the bigger screen, better front camera and better battery life make it feel like an upgrade. The phone speaker is amazing and LOUD, especially compared to 6S. Rear camera is almost similar to 6S. But overall, I really like the phone. The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you‚Äôre a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.",5

There was no cut when it was given to them and its obvious they made a slight peel cut on wire to void warranty.

Cons:
1. Build quality is cheap. Plastic look
2. Bass could have been better
3. Charger quality looks cheap and magnetic power is also not so good. Ear pieces fall off easily and box can easily break
4. Could have been a Type C charging port rather than micro usb as most of the phones nowadays have type c port

(53k bill - 1750 hdfc instant discount - 1250 amezon cashback = 50k)

but after using 5 days I'll sell this in 48k
coz i couldn't fit Apple IOS ecosystem

because in apple u can't download free Premium apps from safari easily like crome .
for me editing & many other small day to day life things ( like downloading of INSTA , WP , FB , TWITTER posts , sometimes Call recordings , using of otg pendrives ) which u can easily done android compare to ios .

after purchasing 11 , in just 5days am realising that am Android kida üêõüòÇ & i sell my iphone 11 in 48 k (2k lossüòÇ) now am going for onePlus ( android again )

now am telling my 5 days EXPERIENCE -

Performance - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Camera(both) -‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Battery - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (i just changed 3 times in 5days but apple 5w charger takes 3 hr for üíØ full charge but backup is good

Display (60hz LCD pannel display) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Stereo speakers - Awesome ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

if u reading my review in 2020 , 2021
then i want to tell u that iphone 11 is 4G phone
not 5G means not future proof for me ( if u r using for 3,4 year ) then Go for iphone 12 coz its 5g with amoled display with less edges compare to 11

Sound quality is ok ok. But not as expected by MI. Built quality is good, suffering with case box issues. If you place earbuds into casing box then it is supposed to disconnect from phone while it is changing but that doesn't happen. Also earbuds not make contact to charging point. Case gives you back up for 1-1.5 times. Earbud works for 2.5-3 hrs hardly.
Bluetooth connectivity is also poor. If you place hand on earbud while wearing, it gets disconnected. Sounds funny? But it is there.
Need to mention that pathetic experience in calling with this. Your voice can't reach to listener at other side. Also creepy sound is heard in between conversation. It is not ideal for traveling as well. You may lose either earbuds.

18849,Decent Product,"Pros:
1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot

Cons:
1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time
2. Makes lot of noise while printing.

Verdict:
You can use this product only for printing and copying. If you are specific about scanning, dont buy this product. The Scanner driver is a big crap

About Flipkart delivery:
Flipkart delivered me MG2400 instead of 2470. By look both will be same. but 2400 is cheper than 2470. So guys, note down the model no when you get the product
I later called flipkart and raised a request for return. Again they took a weeks time to deliver
Not expected this from flipkart...",2
21077,Value-for-money,battery capacity is good nice look,4
112,Best buy for the price,"It‚Äôs perfect for that price. I purchased it for my kids to attend online classes. No point in comparing it with Apple apm, XM4 or Bose 700. Sound signature is leaning towards bass. Overall, excellent for that price. Amazon wants me to review noise cancellation. I guess they mean PNC and not ANC.",5
2079,The best decision of my life,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.",5

Bettery backup is imprassive but weight of this phone is quite heavy compare to my previous phone.

2249,It's an iPhone,"iPhone - the name is enough to guarantee buttery smooth performance, with years of guaranteed OS updates (Android, looking at you. I struggled to get the monthly updates for weeks on your own brand Pixel phones, forget about the flashy Samsung and Xiaomi/OnePlus etc.). Amazing camera, no bloatware or selling customer data to third parties (again Android, looking at you. You give the OS for free and make the customer the product to push ads for revenue). After years of being a committed Android user, from the time Nokia/Microsoft stopped making Windows smartphones, for almost 6+years, finally decided being taken for a ride by Google/Android. Well, was using the iPhone 6s for about an year along with my Google Pixel 2 XL, but now Apple iPhone is my only daily driver, and the way things are looking between Apple and Google and how they are focused on business in India, its going to be an iPhone always for me, for the foreseeable future.",5

8140,Value for money,The very first thing I loved about this monitor is that its color calibrated. Not many monitors are. The first monitor I received took a beating during shipping and had a horrible backlight bleed. The second one was good and has no backlight bleed issues. The display quality is fantastic. The color is uniform and there is no flicker. There is a bit of IPS glow just like any other IPS panel. Navigation using the joystick is a breeze. I paired it up with my PS4 and everything has been smooth sailing. Just remember that if you notice backlight bleed after buying this monitor get a replacement asap. No one is mentioning about backlight bleed here and just accepting it as if it's a common defect.,5

8241,Best budget monitor ever,"This is my first monitor. I used a TN panel on an old laptop until now and this feels like a huge upgrade. The display is evenly lit and I do not observe any backlight bleed.

1. Easy to set up and use
2. Good picture quality and contrast
3. Joystick navigation - More useful than you may think
4. Modern looking with thin bezels
5. Vesa mountable
6. Good antiglare while still keeping colours at a good saturation level

Cons:
1. Not enough range of brightness. I would prefer a much dimly lit display in the night.
2. Ports facing backwards - I would rather have the ports facing downwards so that I can keep the monitor closer to the wall

This display will be enough for anyone who is just looking for an add-on display or a good single display.",5

Camera is top notch especially the video quality. 4k videos at 30fps is amazing. Though the phone has only 60hz refresh rate, it is smooth enough. As always, the iOS is pretty perfectly optimised.

8193,Monitor stand very shakey.,"This is a very nice monitor for its price point. at just over 8K (10+k now), this is an excellent buy. The pictures are not very sharp but are crisp enough for everyday use. The colours are not vibrant or true colours but they are not bad at all. I'd say good to very good, if not excellent. Text and font are crisp and not very sharp. The panel and switches feel cheap and flimsy but it works without problems.

The one issue with this monitor is the stand. As you type, with the slightest shake of table, the monitor keeps shaking up. The stand isn't study or rigid to hold the monitor firmly when the table moves (I have a height adjustable table)

The monitor is wall mountable, has only one HDMI port and also supports VGA. It even has audio output (not USB). Overall a good buy for this price point (8K) and not 10.5K at what it is now at the time of writing this review. In two days they hiked the price by 2000 rupees!",3

2258,Superb. A wise a decision,"Superb. It‚Äôs a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don‚Äôt think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can‚Äôt multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?",5

2036,iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals,"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!
Now, off to the device.

Pros
The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.
Speakers sound better than my previous phone.
A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!
OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.
Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.

Cons
Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.
Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.
No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.

Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.",5

Let's come to the point.
Noise cancellation is 100% if you are using the highest volume.
Sound quality is also good but it is about 90%.
Bass quality is also equal to sound quality.
I don't no about built quality because I'm not expert in that so let see how long it will go..

Old review: Its wire got damaged after 2 months of purchase. I wrote an email to claim a warranty and it had been 2 and half week now. There is no response from Boat. After sales customer service seems to be pathatic. It appears, they don't value a customer at all. If I don't get any response within a month from a warranty claim request.

No bass, absolutely nothing, my two year old cheap chinise tws earbuds had tighter bass, any boat or mi headphones wired will have better bass than this. Its just single stroking sound, no low end seperate sounds. Only mid is clearer, high is not crisp. Overall they are dull.
2. Surrounding sound is really bad. Even with game mode in PUBG you can't find out whether the enemy is on front or back, it's only left or right. You can't make out the direction except left or right.
3. Sound seperation is really bad. You can only hear mid properly in a song. Instruments and bass takes backstage. Very bad for songs.
4. The base could have had bigger battery. You need to charge the base everyday if this is your only pair of earphones. And the charging via micro usb is very slow.
Pros :
1. Bluetooth connectivity is superb. Connection doesn't break, unlike my previous tws es. Both single and double connectivity is really good.
2. Very convenient. Small, light, easy to carry. I generally use single one to watch YouTube videos at night. I can even use both while lying.
3. Game mode has very low latency. You can use it for gaming, only issue is with surround. You can make out with left and right but can't whether the sound is coming from front or behind.
4. Fit is good,if not great. Doesn't fall off the ear.
I would suggest u to wait for a few more twses to launch. This one is below avarage in terms of sound quality. Buy wired or collar type bluetooth earphones if you need better sound in the price range.",3

12251,Not recommended at all,"It is really bad, bad service. The earphones are one of the best sounding, quality is very poor, I had buy another one within 2 months as it stopped working on one side and they wanted me to ship the product to and from Delhi, which would cost me more than earphones themselves. Second earphone also stopped working on one side within few weeks. Though they sound best in the price, buying them frequently feels stupid and warranty feels useless.",1

4040,THE REVIEW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR!!!,"Start with the packaging. It was just fine, nothing was new there.
The build quality feels sturdy.
The in hand feel of this flash drive is superb.
I bought it for Rs. 970 for 64GB.

Now coming to the performance.
I didn't faced any major heating issues but yeah it heats up. May be the heat coming out of it is a lot for you but for me its just fine.

It reacts differently with different ports as we all know already.
The best speed which I got is on the 3.1 usb type-C port.
The test results are between different ports but with same pd.
2.0 vs 3.0 vs 3.1 vs 3.1 type C.

NOTE = I'm not sharing photos of the pendrive itself because as I can see its easily visible in the other reviews.

Like this review if it helps you, cos it really motivates me to keep doing this work.
Thanks!

Majority times it doesn't get paired.,3

1209,@amazon better avoid selling Redmi earbud 2C,"Genuine review redmi earbud 2C

Bought this earned for my kid's youtube channel educational interests. Bought at 1099 with amazon voucher.

Everytime got a defective product only.

1st time - left side ear bud stopped working after 3 days

2nd time - right side bud stopped working after 1st use.

While keeping inside case, it is not charging. Secondly it is not switching on. So obviously not connecting too. Tried reset procedure as instructed by redmi, holding for 15~20 sec multi option button, but no use.

Better avoid buying Redmi earbudb 2c . A product everyone failing symbolizes no quality check.

1087,Too much of expectations but not worthy product.,"Just used it for hours & figured boat are far better then this.
Watched many reviews & decided to buy it but not worth.
Pros: light weight, just ok sound quality no high base (which is what I like)

Cons:
It's mat finish makes it a very slippery product.
The buttons needs to be pressed very hard which causes pain in ears.
No song change option. This is a basic need, if you want to change a song looking for the phone. (Dounle-tap activates Google, single pause paly, 3 tab some gaming mode that's all)
There was a rattle sound from the buds & when they are kept for charge there is a sound coming if it's moved a bit.
Feels very cheap don't feel premium at all (looks premium though)
There is a sound from left earbud everytime you play/pause which is very annoying.
Not sure these are durable at all.
If you plan to buy this stretch your budget & go for boat. They look & feel a lot better then this & music is no match at all.",1

Delivered in 3 days, kudos to Amazon! Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)",5

3097,For first time printer user; wants to print at home on your own,"ABOUT THE PRINTER:-
user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.
2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.
HOW TO INSTALL:-
so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.
1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.
2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.
3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!

hope it helped :)",5

8162,CLOUDING ISSUE and Pixel can be seen by eyes which is disgusting,"It is magical. It is a very bright and extra smooth display. I am using it without Freesync enabled, and the 1080p is absolutely the best. It took me a while transitioning from a 4:3 monitor to a 16:9 aspect ratio, but this is the perfect workable resolution. 4k monitors are stupid for a small screen. You will need at the very VERY least 32 inches to make sense of 4k resolution, otherwise the icons, the display is cringe.

Everyone knows about the LED quality of LG, it is mesmerizing. The IPS panel is absolutely bright and it is perfect for watching movies, browsing social media, checking email and the common day-to-day tasks. The blacks aren't as inky, but it is as good as an IPS panel can get at this price point, but the WHITES are absolutely LIT AF. You can't expect great gaming performance with mediocre frame rate, as it is not made for the AAA titles; but if you're a fan of the classics like I am, you would absolutely love gaming with this monitor.

It doesn't cover much of the Colour Gamut, but it will be fine for an entry-level or first time creative professionals. If you're someone who work with the visuals ie if you are a Graphic Designer, Video Editor or an entry-level intern on a very VERY tight budget, you can't get wrong with this.

According to him, the Sound quality is very good and the headphone covers his ears comfortably. The microphone is very good. I used it and found it to be true. The cables are of good quality. Adults who got used to in-ear headphones, may find it uncomfortable to have it on the ears for a longer time. This is because , since the ears are fully covered, after half an hour or so, we start feeling the heat. But my son does not like in-ear phone as it pains for him and is also was very fragile for sudden pulls.

They are designed to speed up the Random access read/write operations of the card so the requests to read and write small blocks of data unlike the Class10, U1, U3 etc dealing with the continuous throughput of data generally for large files.

So this card is A2 in theory twice as fast as A1 for those random operations and it really does make a difference

But not only is the card fast for small random read/write operations its also fast for data throughput rated @ U3 V30

You'll notice the LCD screen only when you're comparing it with another OLED phone otherwise it's display is Okay!!

The stereo speakers are fabulous, even the earpods sounds amazing.
I would also like to tell the people who kept saying they got fooled by Amazon, they didn't got Airpods as it was mentioned...my dear it was already mentioned Earpods and not Airpods, there's the difference between Ear and Air.

2. The game mode does work well but still there is a lag.
3. It pops out of ears doesn't matter how hard you push it in the ears it will not have a good hold. If you have oily skin then God bless you keeping it in.
4. The build quality is really good along with the charging case well built plastic only reason i gave a two star.
5. Call is average. During phone call the other person was able to hear me properly but during video call not so much.

1245,Decent value for money.,"After using them for 2 to 3 month here's my review about this product.

Sound:
Sound quality is good bass is better on a average volume you can not listen music on it with full volume as sounds feels crappy. Over all I am happy with its sound quality.

Build Quality:
Build quality is good case and the earbuds doesn't loose there matt finish till now

Battry:
Battry backup is awesome sometimes I forget to charge them for days. Takes 1.5 to 2 hrs to be fully charged It's mention that it gives total 12 hours of backup but on daily life as a average user it's more than enough.

Connectivity:
I would say connectivity is ok ok.. Takes 2-5 sec to connect as it's not able to connect multiple devices at once, sometimes I struggle connecting and switching them between my mobile and my pc. And yes I don't why but sometimes connection strength become very poor. Bit disappointed for this only.

Overall
I had purchased 2 pair of these one for me and for my friend she sometime complain about earbuds connects automatically with mobile while they are in case and even in her handbag.....thats newüòÖ but I did not faced such issue till now.

I bought them the day release in around rs1750 each (salo ne koi discount bhi ni dia 2 lene pr bhiüôÅ) which is ok for me üòú....",4

If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.

The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.

Having said that, the phone is not bad.
It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.

iPhone 11- White colour,128GB, 4GB Ram, Updated to iOS 14.

I ordered it about a week ago(17th Oct) and Amazon made sure that I get the choice of color and storage I ordered. Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.

I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.

Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.
Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.
Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.

Owning a iPhone is a dream for many. Thank you Amazon for making this dream happen.

1295,Value for money!,"Hello, Giving honest review about this earbuds
This are really too good under 2k this is the one of best u found.
Lets talk about details-
1) Sound - 4/5
2) battery- 5/5 for home use otherwise 4/5
3) Bass - 4/5 As I excepted its really cool.
4) Noise cancellation - 5/5 this is one of best thing I found in this earbuds.
Now If You are confuse between Earbuds I will suggest you to buy this because under 2k you will not find any otherone.
If your budget is under 4k then there are other earbuds available which may be Better than this but i think you will not find any big difference Between them.
Review is based on my opinion it may varies further i.e may be in favour with you or not!",4

1227,"Good, but....","They're honestly great for 1900. They fit in snugly, connect with phones pretty quickly and sync which each other really fast too. The treble and the middle is great, but bass isn't that good. You can download additional bass booster apps which certainly increase the quality, but in terms of raw bass quality, it's not that great. Another con is that they're quite uncomfortable if your ears are unusual in shape, because of the capsule design. The noice cancellation is excellent. Overall i'd say it's worth it, but don't buy it if you think you have unusual ears. Hope you find this helpful!",4

5063,Perfect storage expansion for 128gb Surface Pro 6,"Class 10 SDHC card would give me 12 MB/s transfer speed when copying to card from SSD and 80 MB/s when copying to SSD from card. (‚Çπ4000)

This one UHS A2 gives me 80 MB/s on both - copying to card from SSD and copying from card to SSD. (‚Çπ7000)

For my use case, the extra speed was worth the price - It‚Äôs like my device has a new hard disk now. You can get the same performance for ‚Çπ3000 approx with USB 3.0 external HDD. That‚Äôs what I told myself when I bought my Surface Pro but in my experience, the portable HDD is really inconvenient. It‚Äôs a big thing to carry around and you have to plug it in every time.

Things to keep in mind:
1. Don‚Äôt store sensitive data on it - anyone can physically steal the card from your device. And encrypting the card with a password will slow things down which defeats my purpose.

2. Format to NTFS before using - if you are going to use it as expanded storage for windows.",5

3230,"Not economical, will turn out to be expensive if you prink a lot","If anyone wishes to buy this, please note that the cartridges are too expensive and you'll only print around 100 pages from each one of them.

15987,Pretty good,The product was delivered earlier than expected. The earphones are great considering the price range. The bass is good enough and the best I have had in this price range but the treble is very weak. It is most likely not enough for any long gaming sessions. It is good enough for casual gaming and movies though. The ear starts paining a little after extended period of use but I think that will be the case only for the initial few days,4

114,Quality Product with many adjustments. Only drawback: Voice leakage + Loose jack.,"Over the past decade the headphone quality has improved dramatically. I remember how the headphones then used to hurt after wearing for some time and were very fragile.

Compared to now everythings changed. I prefer Boat because its products have proved to always last long. This headphone has a lot of adjustments which will help you get used to it easily.

Edit: 4 months update: Working well as it was on Day 1. No issues for now

Edit 2: 5 month update. Many issue can be seen. Voice leakage. Others next to you can listen to the music you are listening to easily. The jack has become loose and need to adjust it sometimes on phone or laptop to listen clearly. Downgrading my raring from 4 to 2.",2

I am using this watch from last 2 weeks and must say that this watch is only good for looks nothing more than that.
Battery, oxymeter, heart rate, etc all works fine but Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. It got disconnected frequently in case distance between watch and phone goes more that 7 mtrs. Features like call alert and message reading are for name sake.

If you just want to track your steps, distance than this watch is good otherwise go for some better product.",3
222,Quite Good at this price range. but disappointed after a while of using this product,"(When I purchased.)

Just go for this. You won't regret buying such a beautiful product at this price range. Don't listen to any negative comments here they vary from people to people according to their personal experience but overall it's a good deal. Grab it!!

(Months later)

After using this headphone for months, now I have finally started to see its true color. At the very first sight when you purchase this , you get everything work smoothly like butter but a few months later the wire gets damaged torn, streched and its elements from inside pop out without a reason. In such headphones the quality of wire is extremely poor that you do not want to talk about. I need to cover them with tapes like iam a doctor covering wounds with stitches.
so I can not experience air disturbing the sound.

Fooled by you BoAt!!!!!

Good luck.",3

Coming to the product.
Considering its budget.

Pros:
* Sleeky design fits comfortably in the Ears
* Very lightweight
* Automatic pairing is a plus point
* Bluetooth 4 or above versions can also view the amount of charge left in Earbuds.
* Comes handy with case, easy to carry.
* Splash proof
* Deliver the sound as crisp and clear.
* If you're a music üé∂ lover with preferable sound at minimal level you can go for it.
* It has decent Bass

Cons:

* Doesn't look as premium as in images
* I feel in the left ear bud sound is producing low compared to right bud, but not everytime, may be it's because of Mono and Stereo channel's or audio drivers depends upon music.
* They should have provided a charging cable with the earbuds, that's ok we can manage with our regular mobile chargers.
For me I got defected product which only worked for 2hrs there after Right earbud stopped working so I placed order for returning the product.

*If you're a Hard Music lover who needs full amount of bass to get blood from the Ears, don't go for itüòú.",3

Pros :
1. Great body build.
2. Great durability.
3. Great bass and crystal clear sound.
4. Wire is thick and durable for longer period.

Cons.
1 only thing I kinda feed not good about it that's it wire a bit longer, which makes it bulky and kinda hard to handle. But overall it's a great purchase.",5

Both the front and rear cameras are superb and professional to use with extensive features. Lot of intelligent features were considered in the IOS 14.2 and it all works fine in this model. The spatial audio produces clear sound with Dolby Atmos. The power charger and wired earphones were no more provided by Apple in the package and they encourage to reuse existing ones from old iPhones.

I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...,3

5934,Money west product,"I bought this because I wanted to be able to shoot in 4k on my Samsung S9 so needed a quick card with plenty of storage space. It was supposed to replace a ""slower"" Sandisk Ultra. I don't expect to achieve the read/write speeds advertised as these were done in lab conditions. However the card was much slower than my Sandisk Ultra. I am getting maximum write speeds of 6.91MB/s. I am aware the storage capacity is always less than that advertised - but this card had less than 200GB. Maybe I was unlucky but my next mobile will simply have a much larger internal memory rather than messing around with dodgy microsd cards. If I can't even buy a reliable MicroSD card from Amazon as a seller themselves the time has come to move on.",1

18716,Slightly disappointed,"I can say this product is okok need improvement in many area.
Pro:
1. Battery life is fairly good as per specification for me last for 7.5 days.
2. design is good.
3. comfortable on wrist

Cons:
1. Sensor need lot of improvement.
2. BP measurement having feature calibration if we need to calibrate we have to busy or rent a one more device.
3. Watch memory is very less if you are not syncing data every hours you will lost it. Example: if you are not syncing in morning you will never see sleep data for day.
4. only 4 faces are possible in this watch. 3 given and one you can add by you.
5. Sports data show wrong.
6. you can give feedback and ask for support but you will never get reply from boat.

Over all if you want just a Smart watch for show go for it because of price and look and if you are serious about tracing your daily activity not a good product.
MI smart band show more accurate data than this.

76,Good for daily use,"I am writing this review after 5 months. This product is absolutely good. Even at high sound I cannot hear any distortion or anything. So sound quality is the best. It is not a noise cancelling headphone so can't talk about it. Its noise isolation is good. Nothing from outside comes inside and nothing from inside goes outside. Its bass quality is amazing. It fits perfectly on the ear only in one position but when it does, its supercomfy. It is also compact so you can carry it when you are on a journey.
Sound clarity : 8/10
Mic : 9/10
Comfort: 9/10

This is an edition of the review after a year of rough use. Now It's been a year and I've been using it daily about 7 hours a day. The mic stopped working but I don't use the mic often. The soft fabric coating on the ear cushions literally ""shed"" and now the foam is only remaining. But even the foam is very soft for my use. Even now it is comfortable on the ears.

I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).

Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor.

However, I am deeply concerned about 3 recent purchases as I believe they may be fake SanDisk products. Okay, I know Amazon cannot check every item it sells. But at the end of 2020 I bought a SanDisk 250gb micro SD card for a not insignificant sum of money. I used the card for the first time last week on holiday. Unfortunately the card is (intermittently) defective. In other words, some video footage is great and other footage is completely unusable. (And because its beyond the 30 day period Amazon have referred me to the manufacturer.)

On Monday - Prime Sale - I bought 2 SanDisk 64gb micro SD cards. Both are defective. GRRRRR. Although they will record video (in my case using an action camera), when you try to upload the videos to a computer it wont recognise the card, let alone read the video content. When I examined the defective cards in more detail I noticed the colour scheme was different to the other 20+ SanDisk cards that I own (and which work fine). So...either SanDisk has let the ball drop, or Amazon is unknowingly sourcing and selling fake and/or defective SanDisk products. NOT AMUSED!!!!!!",2

Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.

Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.

The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.

I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.

After few days, I checked the recorded videos. I realised the last video clips (before switching off the engine) are always corrupt. I switched back to the factory power supply. The issue continued. BTW, I was using a different power supply as I want to continue to use the cable from a previous dashcam (same manufacturer) Therefore, I returned the camera and got another one.

New one was still very temperamental, however I later found out that the supplied power supply is not powerful enough to charge the flat battery while in operation with the three cameras. When the battery was empty, it was deactivating the rear camera for about 30 secs. I had to recharge outside the car and without the rear camera.",1

7191,Recommended for amateurs,"Ordered this product for Rs. 21,990/- using Prime on 22.10.2019 at 10:00PM & Received it on the Very Next Morning! Product was Packed Tight Perfectly in Sealed condition.

Box contains: Camera Body, 18-55 Lens, Strap, Battery, Battery Charging Adapter & Wire, Kingston 16GB Memory Card, A Carry Case, Warranty Card and Guide.

Turned it On After mounting the Lens to the body and started to Click Pictures and I must Say The Quality of the Pictures are Damn Great and Amazing. Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!

Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoW

I have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.

I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price.",5
8432,Cheap Chinese Origin Product,"No screen bleeding.
Just go for it without second thought because i already watched tons of video and this is only king in this segment also color is so nice.
Just don't change contrast and blwck level or other thing cause company calibration is already best(u can reset to company calibration if u can't fix i usually want deep black but endup mixing light black and pure black.)",1

1150,Many pros. One big con,"If you are buying this to listen to music then please don't do it. If you are a bass lover then spend a little more and look elsewhere. It has no punch. It's OK to listen to audiobooks or for morning walks. Also checked for phone calls. The other person could hear me. Works ok for Zoom and Skype also. Battery seems good. I used for 2 hours. But after two or two and half hours the sound starts fading in and out and you have to charge it. Workmanship is good. Design is also good and lightweight. Don't use while riding a bike. If it flies out of your ears you will never find it again. It's so small. My verdict; for music it's a BIG no. For everything else, sure go for it.",3

What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.",5

2297,Perfect phone,"If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don‚Äôt always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it‚Äôs always great to buy products from Amazon.

This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review
1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update
2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)
3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.
4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But recommend you buy original fast apple charger.
5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.
6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ‚Çπ1500 to ‚Çπ2000)
7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.
8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.
9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that‚Äôs the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage
10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset
11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.
12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice",5
2666,I loved it,"This is my first iPhone so I am learning to use it.Being a tech savvy person, I liked the software, battery backup, touch very much. Earlier Iused google and Samsung phones, but iPhone is definitely superior. It is more secure than android ones and the settings in each app is highly customisable.
It is a nice purchase from Amazon.
Thank you Amazon for timely and safe delivery!",5

It doesn‚Äôt do the one basic function it is meant to do... grind! It doesn‚Äôt even grind tomatoes, even after several minutes. Very horrible product.

I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.
WiFi reception is Average I would say.
Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crisp
The speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love it
The display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurate
Battery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.
The phone is slippery so I use a back case.

Man you‚Äôll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the ‚ÄúBattery‚Äù backup is great for an iPhone which i didn‚Äôt except. It gives you 1 and half to two days of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don‚Äôt need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you‚Äôll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months.",5

20830,Value-for-money,"I received watch on 28 April.
Watch came with charger, warranty card,boat sticker.
It was well packed,in good condition.
Look wise it's looks good.
Display is good n clear even under sunlight.
Belt won't very very best quality but it's very decent n acceptable one light weight we can change if needed.
Watch tracks steps with difference of +- 10 steps when crosschecked manually counting n with my old lenovo hw01 band.
Spo2 it reads with very well being a surgeon I checked with our standard O2 monitor which showed almost correct value with sometime difference of +-2 percent which is definitely acceptable.
Heart rate checks correctly again cross checked with our heart rate monitor .
Blood pressure can't comment how it checks
It gives value around my actual blood pressure but
I will go for actual spygmomanometer.
It displays incoming call n notification if bluetooth is on n location is on all time when used with app.
All 4 stars for watch
Now
App
Which is where problem starts
Sync it with watch all time
App will consider your
previous or 1st activity of a day as base activity n every time watch get sync with app it will adjust your steps to previous activity n decreases the number of steps.
If your goal is 15000
Watch n app will set goal to 8000steps . n steps decreased accordingly then same thing repeats when next sync happens

After using for 8 days got a solution for it
Sync the watch only once in night before sleep n app retains that activity properly
But side effects of which is you have to avoid syncing watch whole day so can't check app for activity but can see watch for activity .
You won't get notifications because watch is not connected whole time with mobile app
Watch is fantastic but app is a crapp.
Hope boat gets it app updated well to avoid PPL not buying watch bec of app
I gave 4* coz watch is awesome n I don't need full time notification .

We can change face of watch from face downloaded in app
Or our gallery pic.

Battery on 8th day of continious use still 36% remaining so for me good battery .
May be less if app is sync all time.
Cost is cheap compared to other watches with similar features.
With good accuracy in steps spo2 heart rate
Display. Multiple sports mode it's good buy with a hope boat
Improves there app too",4

8226,Best monitor under 8k budget,"Though advertised as sRGB over 99% here, this monitor pales in comparison to my LG 25inch ultrawide which is also sRGB over 99%. Looking at the specs page on LG's site for this monitor, the color gamut is 72% of CIE1976 and not CIE1931 which is comparable to sRGB over 99%. Interestingly, the 23inch model does have the latter and will have better colors.

The monitor also has issue with 75Hz where you can see faint lines running through the image.",5

3. Processor is super-fast and multitasking is buttery smooth
4. Feels premium : Design is stylish
5. Timely updates

Cons:
1. Average battery life (typical one day usage on moderate usage)
2. Need to buy a separate fast charger, charging time is damn slow with the regular one
3. Feels Bulky and heavy in hand
4. IPS lcd panel with retina HD resolution but screen quality not that bad (No amoled, No FHD), but considering the competition amoled should have been there

To summarise its a great phone with amazing cameras with some cons but would surpass many android smartphones in performance and camera department in this price bracket!",4

5995,Dont buy not good LOW QUALITY,"I bought this sd card for my phone having purchased one earlier from China very cheap it was supposed to be 512gb but only managed 2gb so a fake. I then bought this 128gb card from Amazon for a decent price and tested it in case it was a fake. The test results were 127.82gb capacity which was correct. The write speed was supposed to be 90MG/s correct speed 61MB/s. Read speed was supposed to be 160MB/s correct speed 81MB/s.
Although not the same as the claimed speed not bad for this type of card and the price paid, good enough to record high end recording.
So not a bad result from a Amazons supplier with a return guarantee till Jan 21 so forget China and pay the extra
and get a genuine item with a return clause. Please see results photos to verified test.",3

4. As per the look I would say its really classy to wear yet the display should be little more large but as per the price I‚Äôm satisfied.
5. I have charge on the day i it delivered and it‚Äôs been 7 days and still 15% battery is there.

This is my first iPhone and it‚Äôs damn good. Had seen some reviews saying that the screen is not good, but let me tell you guys that this is the best LCD screen you‚Äôll ever get in an phone. The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it. And Apple operating system is holding up good and their Face ID is damn fast.
I need not comment on the camera quality as it is among the best mobile camera that is available at this price range. I will post some pics clicked by the camera for reference.
Talking about the battery life, it is kinda decent will last you easily for a day with more than moderate usage.

Would highly recommend this if you are planning to buy your first iPhone.",5
2736,The Best Value IPhone from APPLE!!!!!,It‚Äôs a value added phone for the money. If you are someone is gonna buy an iPhone for the first time. You can surely go for iPhone 11. It has the same camera (except for the telephoto lens) of the pro models. The iOS optimization would give you good battery life. Apple also promises updates for the next 5 years. I have been using this phone for 1 year now and the performance is exactly the same like how I bought the first day. Everything is so amazing about this phone that you won‚Äôt have to spend money to buy the pro models. Surely go for the iPhone 11 you won‚Äôt regret it.,5

I bought this to use with my DJI Pocket 2 camera that records 4K 60fps and needs this kind of higher performance memory card for smooth video. It works really well and is good value for the 128GB capacity. I still find it hard to believe you can get 128GB on such a tiny card.

2607,Next to perfect for a smartphone,"Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.

Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.

Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.

Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.

Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.

Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.

Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.

FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.

Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.

Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.",4

2275,Simply AMAZING!!!,"Very much satisfied about the purchase. Was a little concerned about whether I would be getting genuine product or not, but kudos to the seller (Darshita electronics), they kept my trust. Got a September manufactured made in India unit as well. Every accessory working fine and no heating issues as well. Only heats up a little with my 20 Watts fast charger. I would recommend not to use the fast charger on daily basis. It‚Äôs okay to use it sometimes when you are in a hurry. Otherwise use the regular 5 Watts slow charger. Apple has provided that because of a reason. Only concern is with apple not amazon, which is the cable quality. Very very poor quality which starts to chip off within a few months. So due to sale, i ordered the Belkin cable for charging as it is best in class and MFI certified. Would recommend to use only good quality MFI cables if you want long life for your phone. Other than that, camera quality is top notch and always seems to improve with every software update. Battery life is epic, lasts a full day although I don‚Äôt do gaming on iphone, still I am quite a heavy user.
Very very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon and Darshita electronics. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5

34,Serious review (from a music producer),"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).
For non-music produces (normal people):
This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.

For music producers and mixing engineers:
I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don‚Äôt buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.

9528,Super,"Sound quality:
I replaced the product two times for same reason, the sub woofer was makin a low frequency noise or cracking kind of jarring sound. After replacing for the 2nd time, the problem was same.
Infact the person who came to replace, he also mentioned that due to the same problem the other customers are also replacing the item.

Remote control:
As far as good for home purpose usage.

Bluetooth connectivity:
Another blunder here. Within 1.5 mtrs range the Bluetooth starts breaking the sound.
The Bluetooth gets disconnected and The sound starts breaking unless you're sitting very very close to the speaker, which is not possible all the time to keep your mobile phone near speaker. Then why Bluetooth!

Zebronic, please Make quality product. Being a musician it's very bad experience for me with Zebronic sound system. Though the price is lesser than other speakers, but the quality is also cheaper. Didn't expect this much dissatisfaction I'll experience with the quality.
Thank you for keeping a replacement option along with refund option.",5

I mean now I can finally understand why everyone is so crazy about iPhones! Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!
Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!
Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won‚Äôt regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :)
About the battery life, it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!",5

3. You can use buds continuously for 4 hours. Charging case provides 12 hours of power. Earbuds can be charged 3 times. (***)
4. Light weighted, can be fit in the ears perfectly. (****)
5. Having possible features. (****)
6. It fails at calling voice. Calling voice won't be clear. It produces a noise (can be hear by other person) while speaking over call. (**)",4
14278,Bad quality,Only One year warranty but when we purchased from other outlets we get 3 years warranty,2
42,Quality Package,"Well this Headphone will cater almost all your needs be it Sound Quality, Comfort, Build or Connectivity.
‚ö´ Sound
You get the best Bass ever if you have been using just earphones.
The bass is not irritating, it's quality Bass as I said. Since it is wired you won't compromise the sound for sure.
I used Real Original Sound Technology on my Realme 1 to boost Bass they gave awesome output, I love the quality.
‚ö´ Comfort
These are far comfortable than those wireless ones as this neither have battery nor Bluetooth driver so it makes it way lighter.
And regarding how long we can wear it in single use , don't worry about it as I haven't experienced any pain or so at all.
So you can definitely use if you are getting it for your long lectures for your study purpose.
Although I will update this section if I see any problem in my lecture sessions.
‚ö´ Build
Very comfortable and portable, infact these are flexible too , it takes only a space of a small notebook. The wire is of good length and made of good quality and the input aux has been given extra protection too.
‚ö´ Connectivity
Since it's wired there are no issues, just plug and use anywhere be it your phone , laptop or iPod .

I got it for Rs700 although sometimes it might be available even in 600.
Even if you get it in Rs800 you won't regret it all
I would say the best Sound experience I got ever just cause of this.
So go for this without any thoughts.",5

I have had few bluetooth devices ranging from RHA (8,000 Rs that lasted a year), Jabra 65 (still going good). I wanted a backup pair. So bought these. I had little to no expectations from these. But surprisingly they are and sound more than it's price.

Pros :
Decent sound quality.
Miniature Size.
Good battery life. (The Jay's M5/M7 still leading here).
IP rating is an added advantage.
Cons :
Uncomfortable fit (that's variable according to ear shapes).
Call quality is not good.

So to summarize : If you are looking for a Bluetooth Solution purely for calling better buy the Oneplus Z (almost same price + better battery + USB C +quick charge). Else you can buy them.",3

The person on the other side would hear the background noise unless you are at a place where not even the wind is blowing. After I talk for 40-45 mins I face a lot of disturbance while hearing the other person's voice. It charges quickly, it's very light. Google assistant doesn't works properly. I had to return it twice. The first time was a replacement after I got a more degraded product. I returned it the second time today and Amazon told me that my money would be refunded.",2

11923,Absolute rubbish!,"This is an average earphone that does the job it is meant to do. However I'm an audiophile (I work in AIR). So I am used to listening to Seinnehier, jbl or Sony audio. The brand is boult which sounds eerily like boat of USA. There the similarity ends. Boat earphones are far superior, the bass is perfect even for very low frequency sounds and treble balance is calibrated in a way that does not pain your ears even at full volume.
Please note: If the audio quality is stereo or multi track recording, then this earphone will work fine. The problem arises if the audio quality is not up to the mark. Then this boult headphone is found wanting.
Edited after 15 days of mild use:
The earphone's one ear went dead and the volume on the other ear reduced drastically rendering it useless. I cannot return/replace it or repair it. So Rs. 350 plus gone down the drain. Reducing the star rating.",1

I have used it for 5 hours continuously.Sometimes calls are not very clear, mostly when battery is low.

Face ID can be detected even in the dark. Battery backup is nice. Phone camera automatically adjusts to take high quality pics and the night mode is fantastic. However, I am not really happy with the front camera for taking the pics at night(May be I am not using all the options for the night mode,
I need to learn more on that).
Screen is responding very well on the feathery touch. I am already an iPhone user, so all the other best features of iPhone are already here.
Last but not the least, I would like to thank the seller for the genuine product and fast delivery with hassle free exchange. Seen the reviews about this seller, I was bit scared but my friend also got the iPhone from this seller and now I also got it. There is no problem with this seller.",5

1139,NOT WORTH FOR Rs.1100,"Iam a normal user,

The most important thing is,
Redmi 2c is not good for outer door.

ZERO noise cancellation.

Sound is not good( while in the call-both indoor and outdoor)
Mic is fine(only indoor)
Bass is not very bad.( some thing is there)

Bad BLuetooth range ( disturbance at 20 ft range itself)even though it is BT 5.0.

Power back up: only 2 times (10 -100%) buds can be charged with the box.

Just 2.5 hrs battery back on single charge of buds.

Not comfortable, it is falling down if bent down.
I have tried changing buds , but no use.
Slipping from the ear if you Walk fast.

It won‚Äôt last more than 6months, just a guess , since manufacturer itself not confident in their product quality( warranty for 6 months only)

Not worth for Rs.1100",2
20412,Decent product,"no auto brightness,getting disconnect many times,only some analog face watches,no weather forecast,slow processor then noice fit, low battery backup only 5 day with wrist wake up sensor on",3

12993,Slightly disappointed,"The earphones are good in terms of quality. BUT I am absolutely disappointed as well as sad that I am reviewing it after just 5 months (I bought it in June), after seeing it fail miserably in terms of durability. The right side of the earphone doesn't work anymore. And that's very sad because the sound quality is actually pretty good... That's why I've given it 2 stars. But durability matters, and these earphones in my case didn't even last for six months.... So I'd rather not buy it if I was looking for looking for something more long lasting.",2

549,Not as expected,Its not as per my expectation and my ears started paining after using this for 1 hr.. Really heavy and not good to use..,2
2412,Very good phone but not a significant improvement over the previous-gen models,"So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.

Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.

The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.

I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone üò¢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.",5
1442,Good enough,"Have been using it for 3 days now. Sound quality pretty good. Have faced few bugs with Bluetooth connection, but easily resolved by unpairing & pairing again.

6162,Average product Not for Heavy use,"Noise is very high. The blades were just cut and they didn't even sharp it.
I'm wondered how this useless product is the best seller. Getting a doubt if it is a paid promotion. The juicer jar has got a mesh and it is not fixed i.e, there is a gap in between the mesh and the mixer which completely doesn't serve the purpose. Total waste of money.",3
10932,Don't waste your money,Worst product I've ever seen in my life... Flipkart you're such a cheater,1
763,I love it!,"The bass is just amazing. The build quality is good, I thought it would be just average plastic but it sure is tough and the 3.5mm pin is strong too and they have added a spring at the end of it.

But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture.

They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.
Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.

1 week review :
One of the cheaper options with a brand name.
So I decided to get it with high expectations (of returning it).
Sound->
----------
Priced at INR 1799 the sound is pretty loud that no one would complain.
It's got decent bass too.
At this price point, I won't complain about the sound
It's a definite yes üëçüèª
Build and Fit - >
-------------------
Given the price it exceeds expectations.
Plastic matte finish is kinda nice. Opening and closing the case is satisfying. I had to switch to the smallest ear buds to make it fit. It's a pretty good fit and didn't fall off while working out as well. It did irritate my left ear after prolonged use(My left ear is unique ü§≠ and it often happens).
Battery life - >
----------------
Without case - Approx 4 hrs
With case - √ó3 = 12 hrs.
Using 1 earbud at a time can extend your life and that's a neat option at this price.
Pros->
-------
*Double tap for assistant works on Google, Siri and Cortana
*Good sound
*Bluetooth 5.0
Cons>
----------
*While pairing with my phone i faced an issue where I don't get the notification sound regularly. It's a hit or miss.
And while interacting with media volume controls keep popping up. This happens sometimes. Sometimes it's fine.
*Micro USB (But yeah it's dirt cheap)

Overall Rating : üåïüåïüåïüåïüåë (That's 4 on 5) and I'm not returning it. .",4
4246,Format Error,"On docking it to the system it asked to be formatted. The format was unsuccessful and said usable space 64MB

8365,Quality product at affordable price,"Beware !!!! This product is not wall-mountable. The product description clearly says the product is wall-mountable, but it is not. So if you are looking for a wall-mountable monitor... do not buy this product",5
14927,Decent product,"very honest to tell that
pros- sound really crystal clear and design

cons- use build material very low quality and small size of product. bass quality is bed ir compare with boat that is good. i used that and say that that bass quality superb design and build material superb. advertisement picture and actual product looking different,size small.",3
19287,Moderate,Waste of money,2

-Light weight mixer grinder.
-But the cups are not fit with machine properly.
-noise of this machine is same as our old machine.
-performance is average.
-motor has 750watt power but the grinding power of this machine i feel 500 watt

After 15 day use i feel that in this price range you should chose phillips grinder as well.",5
3578,Good product and easy used and quality good.,Good product and good printing quality and easy used Refill ink and color,5
3145,Best printer for solving student purpose !,"First of all, if you're a student who wants a printer for printing study materials, for e.g. notes and assignments, then surely go for it..It also comes with inbuilt scanner, so you can download and print registeration or entrance forms, and easily upload with the scanning option..
Yeah, the cartridge proves to be very uneconomical; So better if you refill the catridge at the right time( when the ink level is low but not dried up )... I suggest you to get a prodot ink bottle and you can easily fill upto 20 times..

21862,Good choice,Weight less comfort nice superb,4
14966,Good,Sort of ok. Size is small compared to other earphones I had earlier. Slips out of the ear. Sound is good no doubt clear bass and treble... Mids are upto the mark too. Depends on what type of music you listen to. Using equaliser doesn't hamper it's performance. Fair deal.,3
4036,Ink cartridges almost cost half of the printer's price,"Printed hardly 50 pages per cartridge
New catridges are highly expensive , about 800 rupees, even if prints 100 pages per catridge, this costs 8rs/ page",1

3) Very low bass
4) if the case battery drained, the earpieces will be ON even it is inside the case.
5) no charging cable ( not a problem since all are having charging cable for their mobiles)",4
13496,Moderate,While grinding it automatically gets stop in between. Had a Very bad experience with this. Didn't expected such a poor performance from a brand like butterfly,2
21149,Worth the money,It's ok but not very good,4
3513,Quality Printing,Perfectly printing from my laptop as well as from my mobile. My expectations are fulfilled,4
2170,Great phone,Great phone.... Gifted this phone to my brother from another mother after my first dream govt job... It was a surprise for him... He almost cried when I presented him this phone... Since I haven't told him earlier about the job confirmation,5

7584,Good for beginners,"For begginers this is one of the best camera all options are really handy and accessable, this could be easily changed with ISO, Appature and Shutter speed. Yes being a begginer I am too much confident on this 1500D and I just love it.",5
3459,Good printer,The print quality is superb. Easy to install. Only the main problem is the price of cartridge is too costly. For only occastional use not for daily use.,5
14096,Could be way better,Damaged product,2
14378,Could be way better,quality worst...poor fiber plastic used,2

Reviewing after rough , everyday use for 2years.",5
18958,Expected a better product,"Very expensive as it will give you only 30-40 pages.

14098,Could be way better,Motor sound very noise..i don't like,2
14839,Nice,Product is good and comfortable to use but the company needs to focus more on the sound quality and bass of the earphone. Quality of the wire is also not upto the mark.,3
269,Okayish product!,"After using more than 20 minutes, my ears started aching. Can't be used to longer duration continuously. Need to keep it off for a while then put it on again. Sound quality is pretty amazing though. Loud and clear. I dropped it once from a height of 5 ft and one side of the headphones stopped working which surprised me a lot.

252,Product Review,"I‚Äôve bought this headphones for 700 bucks and should appreciate the quality of the product.
The bass quality is premium at this price range.
I‚Äôd definitely recommend this product in case you are looking to purchase something below 1000 bucks.
However this review is totally based on my day one experience of the product. The durability depends on our maintenance and also the manufacturing quality of the product.

Thanks Amazon for the safe delivery of the product.",5
6761,Branded item,Stopped working around 7 months after the purchase. Lodged a complaint with the company but after weeks no response from the company.,4

22099,Very Good,"Scratch prone screen, a bit small, battery is good. Boat should do something with screen protection like giving a well fitted screen protector or screen guard with this type of products.

8134,Good product but needs more improvement with this price.,"The whole box comes with plastic visible wrapper. So the shipping was awesome in 1 days delivery. However inside the box 1 monitor, 1 stand neck , 1 base stand, 1 cable management clip, 1 HDMI cable, 1 driver cd, and some documents comes. No vga cable . Hence can use your old one. The base stand's design is awesome with half circle shape. Made inside with aluminium finished with hard glossy black plastic. The stand neck and the back side of the monitor also has glossy plastic finish. Back side there 5 ports including vga port named as D-SUB and HDMI port. So I connected my monitor via vga cable cause I have no HDMI port. however ther are wall hanging option too at back. Front side the whole 16:9 ration screen has very narrow literally invisible bezel but when you will switch on the display you can notice very thin bezel at 3 side while the bottom has normal brezel with LG logo and only one joystick switch (Lg likes joystick ) . The resolution of the monitor is pure Full Hd with IPS cinema panel . The panel quality is A++ with very accurate real color production and this is the feature of the IPS panel. IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen. LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular. I damn gurantee that you will not regreat after buying. Also this monitor is protected by Lg's manufacturing warranty. I got this monitor at Rs 6800 with card instant discount. So thanks amazon and thanks seller and thanks LG . Hit Like if you have liked this preview",3

The small jar does not fit properly and whenever the mixy is run it gives out the smell of burning or the smell of something wrong happening inside the machine. Every time I operate it it gives the feeling as if it is the last time.
We are not ble to use the small jar as whenever it is used some smoke comes out of the mixer. Our previous mixer Sumeet created a record of running for around 20 years. This One I think will create a record of not even running for 20 months.",1

It is a good product by Boat. Some big issues are also there.

I think it is the main issue that must be solve. Another issue is i noticed that whenever this watch arriving in sale after that boat is giving you new clock styles which is still low in amount so why boat not giving or updating new style after certain time. SpO2 sensor is not giving proper reading though, so please keep in mind that don't think this results are actual or don't take results in real time.

Battery life- 2.5 hrs with single charge, USB 3.0 (Need C type) and slow charging
Bulid quality- Poor case quality, cheap plastic used, case lid is very poor quality.
Verdict- If u r looking for tws and having tight budget with some known brand under 2K then go for it, otherwise OnePlus bullet Z is best in wireless catagory.

1141,Redmi Earbuds 2C,"Have always had a penchant for wired earphones, have owned top-shelf wired earphones.
Never liked the Cupertino-brand lookalikes sold online, so didn't bother with TWS, until I set my eyes on the Redmi Earbuds 2C.
Loved the design, at least they're having their own identity and not being pretentious!
Also, they don't bulge out of your ears and make you look silly.
Audio wise, they're great with the connection, too.
I've tested them in various scenarios, intensive work outs, Zoom Meetings, Netflix and console gaming and music streaming. Didn't disappoint one bit.
One factor about these I liked, that they are very comfortable to wear. Never once fell out, or had me at fear of them falling off.
The case, in itself looks premium, with it's all matte finish, but will be prone to scratches.
With the oncoming festive season, these are great for gifting.
My mother can't get enough of these. She uses them to watch recipes on YouTube, while in the kitchen! I say, paisa vasool! üíï

It also has Durga IPS Pannel with anti-flicker.

And also supports AMD Free Sync which is not free it cost you about 8800rs

One day I have tested its build quality it was really an awesome experience. I throw it from my 3rd floor and after that...... It was working fine without a single scratch.
But it starts making sounds like vrrroommm vrrroommm.

You can also use this monitor as Dosa Cooking Vessel because it is really large in size. Before using it as a Dosa Vessel make sure that your heater or gas or something else have to reach atlest 69k degree celsius that's it. Now you can cook your Dosa

7111,Good for beginners if get in correct price.,"This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.

SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.

RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.

KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.

TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.

Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.

OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.

MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.

HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.

LAN PORT- LAN port is given.

USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.

SD CARD PORT- available at left side.

CHARGING POINT- at your right side.

HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.

CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.

KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.

Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.

All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.",5

I liked the music of it till the time I owned it. The music was average, not the best and could best be heard upto 75% of volume. There was lot of distortion in sound at maximum volume.
The bass was average or almost not there at all.
The best part was it's connectivity. It rarely lost connectivity with my phone. But when it lost the connectivity I had to disconnect them from my phone and connect after a few seconds.
The worst part was it's noise cancellation. The environmental noise cancellation didn't work at all. There was more environmental noise than the recipient's voice. I couldn't use it for calls at all.

72,"Painful at first, but useful for conferences, after loosening it.","Okay, let's start by saying that you will not get anything like this at this price point. Considering that, this headphone can be easily used for video calls, it's actually pretty great for this which is my primary use case for it. Vocals sound a teeny tiny bit heavy or boom-y, because a large part of the spectrum that it can cover is occupied by very heavy, and not pleasing bass. But you wouldn't notice it if this is your only pair of headphones or if you are not used to better headphones/earphones.

Coming to music, unless you're a total basshead, you wouldn't be able to tolerate the boominess of it, there's too much of base at every frequency of its very limited spectrum, and honestly it gets very tiring after a while because of the heavy bass. This fact is compounded by the fact that these are NOT, I repeat, NOT comfortable, especially if you're wearing glasses with thick handles, even considering the adjustments you can make to make it fit better. There is a remedy however, mentioned by another reviewer. Use a book or anything and put the headphones over the book, for a day or two, and it should loosen up enough for you to wear, for a longer duration.

Having said all that, I don't listen to music, neither watch movies with this thing on. I only use this for video conferencing, and apart from the headache I got from the tightness of the headphones, I am VERY satisfied with the product. It actually becomes usable after it's loose enough without your head exploding. It is very cheap, and honestly, there's nothing like it out there at this price. You can usually find it for Rs. 800-900, don't buy it for a higher price, NOT worth it. Ciao!",3
3537,Go for ink tank printer rather than inkjet,"Good but expencive ink. I have only printed 4 color photos and colored cartrage was empty and it cost much more.

I got this in PRIME day sale for 6.5k with cashback, so it was a great deal for me, as its usually priced around 8500 in normal days.

1) Best Clarity with different modes
2) Perfect to watch movies on.
3) Bezeless display gives you more space.

1) The stand is bit wobbly if shaken the LED can fell flat on the screen so be careful about it.

The trebble is a little less, the frequency goes up to 15000 Hz although beyond 15000 upto 20000 the volume gets faint for me and barely audible. Comparing with Dr Dre Power beats 3 that I own, the over all sound seems to be muffled and seems to be comming from a small speaker yet has better base than Dre. Dre seems like u r sitting in a hall listning to music. The connectivity is also good compared to Power beats 3. I absolutely love the charging feature and if u r careful u will never be out of battery and I will easily use this earphone over a wired one any day, although Dre ones could give me 1 hour backup for 5 mins of charge but Redmi seems more user friendly and charging involves less hassle. There is one down side of Redmi earbuds is that it will fall off while chewing food or while running so u would have to keep adjusting them. I have been using these earphones since 2 months now.",4

It‚Äôs my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it‚Äôs make me happy

About iphone11
Processor is awesome there is no lag
Camera and haptic touch is very good
I seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don‚Äôt know how to use mobile data option

Battery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XR

It‚Äôs display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.

So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don‚Äôt worry about features like 5G.
in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational",5

But i don't think they do this cheap work. So without hesitate u can place order from Amazon. I have used some days this product then i feel on hand its awesome. I have listened music earphones and stereo speakers. Very loudly sound and every beats are crisp and clear.
Camera quality are awesome no doubt. Display quality is decent and battery life is also decent. Approx 1 day uses with normal uses. Face id is more secure. But i got face one issue. In this Pandemic, the mask has to come down again and again whenever the phone has to be unlocked. So they should give In fingerprint displays. This is safe feature in this pandemic.
Along with the phone, they should also provide a charger. Because you take so much money, you still cannot provide charger, even that big company!
Overall the phone is good, you can buy.",4

841,Very good in best price,"Item looks pretty good. Voice is clear. Still boss I didn't test.
Delivery also very fast this time.
I am buying 2nd time this one.",5
1278,Best value for money product.,"Design/Ergonomics:
Comfortable and case is quiet pocketable. No complaints and it fits well in the ears. Eartips material for the price is good but better options are out there.

Sound quality:
The sound quality out the box is pathetic, however it is not due to the driver in general. I own Audio Technica M50x and Sony WF-1000x, both of which sounds amazing however the price point is too high to compare with Redmi and it is not fair to compare also.
It is bass heavy and lot of details in Mids and highs are lost. Even the vocals have been frequency shifted to sound kind of in mid bass region and it is kind of annoying however it will appeal to majority of the people who tends to think more bass means good sound. For majority of the people the sound quality should be fine.
For audiophiles, download wavelet app to set custom EQ. Boost highs and little bit of mids. Fiddle with the app to get a sound signature which you like. You will be more than pleased to know that the driver is quiet capable of sounding good however the out of the box tuning is too bad. But don't expect flagship like audio quality as it is not possible for the driver to sound neutral with EQ adjustments as some coloration or warmness will be always there in the sound. We cannot remove it as it is the driver property and some of the frequencies may not even be produced as it may be very weak and lie below the -10db point. Guess I am getting too boring here. Lets ignore and consider the price point. Sound quality is decent with EQ adjustment. For android users wavelet app can fix sound quality pretty easily however iOS users have to adjust EQ in all the apps.
Connectivity:
For people who says connectivity is bad, they dont know how other truly wireless earphones work. Lot of earphones don't support Bluetooth 5.0 and it needs to have master / slave relationship meaning only one bud would connect with our phone and then it will relay the signal to other bud. This will cause frequent connection drop and very high latency and while watching video there will be a lag in audio. Bluetooth 5.0 is very good in this price point. The connection is very stable. I have not faced any issues and also while watching video there is almost 0 lag. Didn't try gaming but gamers should always use wired headphone for that true latency free exp. I used to get frequent connection drop in sony wf-1000x which i bought for almost 200 dollars (15 thousand Rupees approx). Compared to that this is like gold standard.
Call quality:
Call quality in indoors is pretty good. The person on other side didn't even identify I was speaking on earbuds. Make sure you are waring the earbuds properly with the mic facing your mouth. It is very good in picking our voice however not sure of how it would perform in noisy environment but for the price paid the performance is justified.

Overall:
This is compelling buy at this price point. Highly recommended for anyone to go cords free at a budget. Reducing a star as the sound engineers could have tuned it nicely if they have worked just 1 hour more and taken feedback from people who likes audio.",4
2157,Product is useless without required accessories.,"Worst policy ever. Product has come with only usb cable without adopter and earphones.Is it making any sense?

7070,Good product for Beginners.,"Brilliant product

Most of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDD

My base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make sense

Second requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GB

Third requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this case

Fourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.

The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.

The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.

I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place adjacent to additional monitor

Very satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.

Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier. I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.

I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C type

This is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy",5

Read/Write speed are great. It does get pretty hot in the process. You get 141 mbps in the beginning and when its hot it drops to 70. But still better than others even while its hot. And as for write its kinda slow. You get 35 to 40 max. i preffer to use the C port as it sometimes provides better speeds on my laptop. I use this on a daily basis as I have all my files on it.

Seems like a design fault, as they swivel towards outside than inside. This creates a less flexible option when you wear it. So trying to use left side on right ear and right side on left ear. That has sorted the issue a bit!

Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it‚Äôs setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It‚Äôs unethical & not expected from hp,1

La extreme normale non ha i 90 mb di scrittura come dichiarato, quindi ho sostituito il prodotto.

Even though there are watch faces available on cloud, watch can hold only 6 watch faces at a time, 4 which comes by default, 1 customized (like a custom picture) and one cloud face, to change the cloud face it needs to be downloaded and synchronized from the app and the new face will replace the old one on the watch. Many functions has to be done on the app and not on watch, for instance if a new alarm has to be set it needs to be added from the app. So most of the features are app driven and cannot be done from the watch.",3

3. reading profile settings is available with pc software which is easily manageable.

cons- 1.in built picture control is very bright and flickering you need to set colors and display settings from PC
2.IPS panel quality is not up to the mark the contrast ratio is poor and black color is dull in screen, which is most important factor of Panel in order to enjoy perfect viewing experience.

Multiple modes are available (reading mode, cinema mode, image mode, custom mode etc.). Picture in picture option is excellent. Free sync available if you use with AMD gpu. I faced a problem to find out the power on/off button. It took around 15 minutes to find it out. Then reading the user manual (available in the CD) I finally found out the power on/off button. Very easy to install, just like plug and play. This is not a bezel less monitor. I am satisfied with this product and service also. If you are looking for a pc monitor and your budget is Rs.10,000/-, then this would be a good choice. So I will give it 5-stars.",5

Card class and speed has always been tricky to define due to advertising mainly read speeds, not write speeds. Class 10 means nothing more than it can sustain a 10mb/s write speed, that's it!

They have been getting better every few years and these A2 cards seem to be the best for speed v price.
My last card had a write speed of 50mb/s which I though was pretty good. This one blitzes it. I transferred 78GB of data to the card (a mix of hi res SLR shots, full HD movies, music and pc programs, over 5000 files) in 18 minutes, the card maintained over 80mb/s for all but the last 4 minutes of the whole transfer. It averaged 72mb's in total.

5978,Not worth the name,"Well what can i say, other than SanDisk is always been my memory brand choice. I brought three of these. First one at the time costing alot more than they are now. Ive always worried about getting fake ones etc. However ran the basic tests and everything was great, 2 years later and still going strong. And im constantly removing and adding files, putting it into different phone or tablet. I usually buy a new one every 2 years when i get a new phone and put existing one in a storage case and use when ever. However this isnt really because im concerned but more about the price drops, example you can now buy a 200gb for the price of a 64gb nearly 2-3 years ago. So for me ive always gone for more space when i can, more bang for the buck. Anyways great micro SD card, and havent brought myself around to trying samsungs own because i have never had issues with SanDisk",1

2542,The most perfect Apple iPhone today. No doubt.,"This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage. The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.
The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.",5

Comfort: earbud part is light and comfortable for most people.

19606,Does the job,"Been using this Watch since it's launch. 30th Oct 2020. The product seems good initially, but fails to impress after long time use.

Pros:
1. The watch is lightweight & has slightly premium look.
2. The battery life is good, It lasts more than a week if you don't record any activity & a week if any activities are recorded. (Auto heart rate monitor on & with wake up gesture on)
3. The apps gives good amount of the info about the daily exercise, sleep, and heart rate.
4. The OS is simple.

Cons:
1. Tracking activities is slightly inaccurate. Sometimes the inaccuracy is exponentially way off.
2. The screen flashes before lighting up. And there is solid 1 & half second delay.
3. boAt claimed that they will add watch faces, 3+ months has passed and they haven't added any single watch face, instead they removed 1 watch face. In their Pre-launch advertise, they claimed 100+ watch faces will be added, but now they advertise upto 20.
4. I have had issues upgrading my watch and contacted their support. Even after 2 weeks they haven't updated me yet.
5. The UI isn't fluid.
6.Connecting to phone can be hesitating sometimes.
7. The only accurate sensor is heart rate monitor. Blood Oxygen Monitor, Blood pressure monitor doesn't give accurate readings and they are way off the limits.
8. Notifications are good feature but it doesn't show full notification if the text is too long.

Final thoughts: Given the price, and all the cons, it's an ""okay"" device for the people whom are new to smart watches. If you exercise daily, it can be use to get overview of your activity, with slight inaccuracy.",3

2) Audio Jack quality is superb and it comes with pre installed spring at the end of jack to prevent the wire cut

Cons:-
1) Some people may not like it's tight fit. Especially people using glasses.

1027,Don't Buy it,"Update- After using it for the last 25 days...
This has to be the worst product I used ever...please don't buy it...
This product has soooo many flaws...
If I leave out the fact that this is good only aesthetically...there is no good thing about this product...

Firstly,
The sound quality isn't good at all..
400 Bucks MI Earphones has much better sound..
This one is just loud.. not bass.. you will get a headache within 30 mins of continuous usage..
Sound - 4/10

Secondly,
The bluetooth connectivity is very poor.
Mid songs you will face sound drops multiple times.
When you keep the phone in your pocket then also you might face this issue...
Products lot cheaper than this has much better connectivity...the same problem I faced in laptops and tv connectivity...too much sound drop... multiple times...
Connectivity- 1/10

Thirdly,
Not meant to be used during calls...the other side can hardly hear you or they can hear a robotic voice...the battery backup is also a lot less than what they mention
Calling/battery - 2/10- 5/10

Lastly,
This product's only selling point is the way it looks... Nothing other than that
Aesthetics- 8/10

I don't recommend this at all... I know 1800 is a small price for truly wireless but hey I can understand the sound quality but when they can't even offer proper bluetooth connectivity then makes no sense buying this..
Go for wired ones or the wired bluetooth ones...but don't waste your money here on this...",1

For Music :
Bass is really good and the fit is really good so it creates a good environment listening music.
For Movies:
This was really good when you watching movies on your phone and this where the noise cancellations come in handy ( again noise cancellation depends on how you wear the buds check the extra tips and which is good fit for your ears)
For calling :
Now this is where I was really impressed have to be the best wireless buds for calling for sure. Interiors it gave good sound quality and exterior there was a bit ambience sound involved but still the opposite side could hear me properly.
The build quality also looks good the only thing which would have been great was a C- Type charging port and the best is the charging case which is very small and really good compared to Boat products too .

But, its quite light, which may seem cool, but honestly its not like we need to move it around much.

Youtube is very useful for first time user to get familiar with the settings.

The seller was very nice. Delivery was good and product was authentic,as always!

147,"Nice sound, careful with the extra bass though!","Pros: Great build, comfortable on the ears, nice sound quality. Not sure if any sound cancellation was happening, I suppose that will be better tested during a flight or a commute.

Cons: the bass sounds a bit muddy, unclear, and this gets worse if you're already using something like Dolby Atmos or even an equaliser setting that increases the lower frequencies. When I listened to Santana's Samba Pa Ti using Sony or JBL earphones, the drums sounded tight, clear and distinct. Not so with these phones. My recommendation would be to turn off any sort of bass boosting software on your playback device, because these phones are designed to boost it anyway.",4

Coming to the camera it‚Äôs a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.

The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.

The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera.",1

Over all building quality is top notch,camera is excellent. And battery backup is also good for regular usage and don't play games on it.

31,Very tight ear piece and loose 3.5mm connector.,"The ear-piece is so tight that ears get hurted within a few minutes of wearing it. It has unnecessary clockwise roation instead of anti-clockwise, such that bottom part of my ear doesn't get surrounded...

Even a 5% volume can be heard by a person behind me. And the connector works okay in my laptop, but falls very easily from my mobile phone. Overall product doesn't seems to be sturdy, the wires seems to be can be easily break with just a small strech due to rubber-like substance.

Last time I had used Mdr Zx110a which didn't had sound quality as this, but everything was sturdy, comfortable and still working after two years (with 35+ times falls from height and alot of streches), just that it got fungi right now due to moisture conditions...

There is no return, only replacement with same product available, I have placed just to be sure if its the problem with only this one or every piece got the same problem.",1
2320,Worth it !!,"I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.

Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.

The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.
The screen size is really cool.

The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.

The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.

Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Apple üçé",4

1210,Good earphones in budget,"After using these earphones extensively for a while, I would say that the quality at which these earphones are being sold is good. It is easy to pair with Bluetooth, the charge lasts for a long time and the outer casing is sleek. I charge the earphone casing for 20 mins and it lasts for a long time.

The noise cancellation effect is not that great but what can one ask at such price point. Do buy it because it has the best sound in this price range. It might take a while for you to get adjusted to wireless earphones. Be cautious when you are moving out as these could fall with improper care.",5
6604,Worst experience ever,"I checked rate in retail shops, they are telling more than 4000 Rupees. But in Amazon i bought for around 3100 Rupees. Thanks to Amazon on this Product.

1275,Not worth the price.,"I have used it for a few days now and I really liked it. The sound quality is worth the price.
It has Bluetooth 5.0 and connectivity is great.
It worked 3-4 hours on full charge and case once charged can charge the earphones 3 times or more. It is sweat proof! At a time I could keep one earbud in case while use one to listen to AudioBook or anything and when i take out the other earbud it automatically connects and I can hear in both! It has a button on each earbud which can do multiple things like pick up calls, pause music, launch Google assistant! The voice quality is nice on the call. All in all, I am happy with my purchase. Thanks amazon for delivering it so fast!

Update: returned the product because one ear bud stopped working after some time and I had had it replaced once already.",1
