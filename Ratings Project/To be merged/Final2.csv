It DOES NOT sync blood pressure data. Heart Rate sync is also not synced properly as there are lots of gaps in the data. It doesn't auto sync with Google Fit.

Some good points :
1. It monitor your sleep in goid way
2. Have decent battery back up

Need improvement in below :
1. Wake up screen gesture is slow, it takes 2 sec to light up the screen.
2. App and device sync...

About blood pressure and oxygen, I personally not trust this device more.. It shows diff result within 2 simultaneous counts....

Step count result is also not that much great... Sometimes it counts steps while you are traveling on vehicle..",2

711,Moderate,No useful,2
712,Could be way better,"Not up to the mark there are no watch faces only 3 and one where you can add photo thats all features are simple, in notifications it will not show emoji just the text and there is a limitation of text to be shown on the screen if you have long text it show one part and rest are skipped, only outlook mails you can reach gmail mails will not open at all it will be blank completely, if too many notification is received then it will cross its limit and stop further notification it is just a watch to play nothing else any how its price is low.
The good part is battery and sleep tracking which works fine.",2

714,Not good,"Not worth to buy, application not supported",2
715,Bad quality,Bad product battery backup 1 dyas,2
716,Slightly disappointed,"I can say this product is okok need improvement in many area.
Pro:
1. Battery life is fairly good as per specification for me last for 7.5 days.
2. design is good.
3. comfortable on wrist

Cons:
1. Sensor need lot of improvement.
2. BP measurement having feature calibration if we need to calibrate we have to busy or rent a one more device.
3. Watch memory is very less if you are not syncing data every hours you will lost it. Example: if you are not syncing in morning you will never see sleep data for day.
4. only 4 faces are possible in this watch. 3 given and one you can add by you.
5. Sports data show wrong.
6. you can give feedback and ask for support but you will never get reply from boat.

Over all if you want just a Smart watch for show go for it because of price and look and if you are serious about tracing your daily activity not a good product.
MI smart band show more accurate data than this.

839,Decent Product,"Pros:
1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot

Cons:

2. Makes lot of noise while printing.

Verdict:
You can use this product only for printing and copying. If you are specific about scanning, dont buy this product. The Scanner driver is a big crap

1531,Bad quality,"No fast charging!!!! Stop with the false advertisement once and for all!! One of the reasons I bought the PowerBank is to make use of the fast charging and am completely upset with it. The product however is not bad on design and backup front but definitely needs improvement as it lacks quality standards compared to the Chinese ones.

Review after 3 weeks:

Powerbank started to behave in weird ways by disconnecting every 5 mins when connected to Mobile for charging it, had to manually switch on the button everytime for like 15 to 20 times for the charging to complete in Mobile. Literally fed up with the problem now and contacting service center on this",2
