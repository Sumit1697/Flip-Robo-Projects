1,Read my review to avoid ear pain,"This is my honest review after using it for 20 days, in this price range it is best one,the only problem i faced was the ear pain, couldn't wear it for more than 2 minutes, its too much tight, so i made it loose by putting it on my book for 48 hours, rest is good, price, sound, clarity, bass and wire length.",5
2,One Star,Received second hand headphone,1
3,Unbiased review,"Im going to give a small comparison of this product with two of the headphones i have been using recently.
This includes Samsung level u ( rs 2249/) and the ant audio w56 in ear wired earphone ( rs 599/)
Pros
Decent build quality
Excellent sound quality
Apt for watching movies.
Soft cushioning
Mic
Good quality cable
Cons
External noices creeps in a lot ( less noice cancellation effect).
Jack is not gold plated, but I won't complain about it because the gold plating on most of the jacks of headphones in this price range will wear off after a months usage.

On comparing the boat bass heads 900 with the ones mentioned above, I noticed that the bass levels were pretty much equal between the ant audio w56 and boat bass heads 900. Samsung level u has the least bass compared to the other 2
In terms of audio quality, the boat bass heads and Samsung level u are in the same level, the clarity of sound is a bit less in the ant audio w56 compared to the boat .
For outdoor use, I would prefer the ant audio w56 as it has better noice cancellation compared to the boat.
Comfort
I have read some reviews complaining about the boat bass heads 900 that it pains in the ears after a few minutes of usage. But I have not experienced such problems.
Build quality
The plastics used is not the best, but acceptable. Ear pads are well cushioned.
Summary
Overall a really decent product from boat, excellent sound clarity and good bass makes it good for watching movies. Most suitable for indoor usage, good value for money ( bought it for 799 but will be available for 599 at certain times.)
Audio quality 4/5
Bass 3.8/5
Value for money 4/5
Comfort 4/5
Build quality 3.7/5
Thank you for your time.",4
4,Best Bass Heads.... But,"The Boat bass heads really live up to their name by providing amazing Bass for music lovers.
Pros:
1. The design is stylish, especially the white one.
2. The headphone is easily foldable making it convenient to carry.
3. Mic for calls.
4. Excellent Bass.
5. Very Cheap (Bought for around 900 during sale).
6. Durable and lengthy Cable.

Cons:
1. You cannot wear it for more than one hour, beyond which your ears start hurting due to the tight design.
2. Slight distortion at 100% sound levels.",4
5,After 30 days microphone not working,"exactly after 30-32 days,
mic problem, in-line mic not working, and when connected headphones it automatically mutes all volume by reducing audio levels automatically, tested on different mobile phones, problem not solved. Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return. Obviously the seller will tell me to go to BoAt service center which is in mumbai city as shows google map and I live in Pune city. Very bad experience, my all money is wasted by this BoAt brand, I should have bought Audio Technica or scullcandy branded headphones in this same price segment. Utterly disappointing.",1
6,Painfull,I had just got this headphones day before yesterday and by seeing them i was happy as they look cool ...But honestly i will tell u that as i wear these headphones like just for 2-4minutes while listening songs...my ears start paining and i remove them but still pain was there for a long time for that day .but yeah song quality is good but still they pain..now today i had request for return of this item,1
7,Worth it!!,"I got this headphone for 599.
the build quality of this thing is pretty good it feels solid
Bass is amazing and overall quality of the sound is also nice no doubt.

I am very satisfied with boAt's after sales services.
my Headphone got an issue with sound (unfortunately) don't worry that doesn't mean you will also have the same issue it was just a 1 in million case
so I went to service center and without asking a single question they got me replaced with another headphones.

one more thing I have to mention that you may feel discomfort after wearing the headphones for quite long, because it is slightly tight, may be eventually it will get loose.",4
8,"Not recommended, wastage of money.",Please don't purchase this product. The one side speaker is off within 2 months. The call was disconnected after connecting this headphones.Very bad product.,1
9,Jack is not gold plated,Awesome Sound but jack is not gold plated!,4
10,Just Go for it,It's a original boat product ... Made in China.... Sound quality is awesome ... Disadvantage- It's going blow ur ears... If u don't like bass then don't buy it,5
11,Extremely good value for money Head phone,"Let us go through the advantage and disadvantage
Advantage
1) Value for money Head set that is a bass monster and clarity is awesome
2) It has a bundled mike so that you can use it to pick up your call on mobile as well.
3) Snug fit to the ear and really responsive sound volume
Disadvantage
1) None

I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a new headset with mike phone. The music quality is mind blowing, awesome.",5
12,Good buy but hurts the outer ear,The sound quality is excellent but it hurts the ear lobes after wearing them for 30 mins. Need to put extra cushioning the ones available are not enough. Also it does not have the volume buttons included.making it difficult. Otherwise it's a good buy.,3
13,Highly recommended,If u love listening music... If good sound quality .. Good bass matters to u.. Then definitely buy these Headphones.. Extremely good bass and sound quality .. Durable.. Looks wise really awesome.. Noise cancelation is super awesome.. Don't think just go for it guys.. U won't regret buying these headphones at all.. Grantee..,5
14,Everything is good about this headphone,"Everything is good about this headphone. The clarity, noise reduction, bass is all perfect. However after using it for a month the left side stopped working. I raised a complaint with BOAT and within 2 weeks I got a replacement. I appreciate the customer service by BOAT.",4
15,Better than contemporary brands,"I liked the super bass feature and the attached microphone. I purchased SONY headphones and before the year ended and the warranty was over, it was completely DEAD. I hope that BOAT does not end up with the same fate. As one consumer mentioned in the review, when he contacted the makers of the headphone complaining that he should get a replacement for the faulty headphones, the company immediately arranged for a new one. The same happened with me with the SONY product but I got terribly pained running from pillar to post to get a replacement. It NEVER happened. Go for BOAT headphones. They are a value for money. I invested Rs. 799/- and I am truly satisfied with both the microphone and the speaker quality. Thumsb Up !!!",5
16,Distorted sound and poor quality headphones,"The worst headphones i ever bought. Bought these headphones for ₹749 and when i got delivery the left side of the earphones was giving distorted sound

Very bad experience with boat , No sound clearity and no bass quality , its a useless product
I m wondering whats the quality checking of this brand , they dont even test their products single time , very bad experience with boat",1
17,Worth It - Buy it now 😊,"Best In Class.
For 799 Rs (Superdeal) I am shocked with its bass and really suggest you to buy. It also comes with a mic for great hands free voice chat.",5
18,Good for pubg... And has a good grip,Very nice headphone for all pubg mobile players.. I used to use scullcandy headphone before but the way this headphone work is brilliant.. I can identify footsteps and bullets direction more accurately than before.. Only problem is that if you have by mistakely kept high volume and if you fire akm then it might hurt your ears coz already this is a bass headphone and akm or M762's sound is very high which can give you headache or short-term deafening.. So take care of that.. Overall the product is good,5
19,Don't Buy,"Please don't buy this, The product was good, worked well for two weeks. Then suddenly mic was not working. We tried contacting the customer service for Boat. But no response. Service center also not picking up call. Don't know what to do with this product now, as can't return also already crossed the return timeline due to followup with customer service since three weeks. But no action was taken. Also this is made in China. So suggest don't waste your money for this product.",1
20,Must Buy,Good Product decent sound Quality in this price range its way beyond expectations. Must Buy for Pure Bass Lovers,5
21,Mind Blowing...,it has a very nice look and it's worth of money..go for it and there is no chance of repent..,5
22,Poor quality- DON'T BUY IT,"I bought boAt headphone few months back, not more than 6 months. But its right side damaged and sound is not coming. Now what I shall do? I can't take this and go for a service centre to my nearest town which is 90 km away from my place of residence. Only thing I do is I purchase another headphone either from Sony or Phillips. I advice all not to go for boAt headphones. They are not reliable. This is my experience",1
23,Fab bass,"Good looking headphone with mic.
Sound quality is awesome",4
24,No base horrible sound quality! If you want an honest rev just read this,To be honest you guys this headphone sound quality is horrible too much treble I see all other people claiming it has a allot of base but no I’m a base lover there’s no base if you higher up the volume it hurts the ear I didnt expect this I wanna exchange already! This was my first headphone I purchased and Im totally disappointed since I use my apple earpiece it sounds much better than this headphone such a waste of money ! Now another issue it stop working within a month and there is no option to replace also this is a horrible experience ever like thus are the worst thing I’ve ever bought online. Don’t buy it amazon lies!!! There was no option for warranty since they didn’t gave any bill or nothing !!,3
25,Editing this review after 10 months. 🎧,"Editing this review after 10 months, so starting with the pro's

So the Audio quality is good you'll get surrounding feel where it's needed & if you are bass lover then you will like it very much, watching Hollywood movies on it feels great.

Build quality is also good, most of the components made with plastic and then some metallic & the cushions are soft and their material quality is also good.

Now the cons

even though its cushions are soft this headphone is painfull for your ears if you are using it continuously, headphone fits much more tighter on your ears than it has to be so thats why...

I was using this headphone with Lenovo vibe K4 note and suddenly it stopped working with it, it was working fine with every other device but stopped working on my device, even my device working well with every other headphones even i tried another bassheads 900 and it was working with my device but my bassheads 900 stopped working with my phone... i know its strange.
Then few months later right side of headphone stopped working and then soon after left side gave up.

Boat seems very good build quality and sound quality but i experienced 8 out of 10 headphones of boat stops working after some period, But the best thing is if your headphones gets any issue within 1 year then you'll get brand new headphones from Boat, you just have to register product and ask for replacement with details of your headphone issue.
Even i got replacement for my product & it's been 2 years since i purchased this headphone and they are working super fine although i had to replace them once because of issue mentioned above.",4
26,Too Tight on the Ears,"I bought these for my Son. Both of us use the headphones.
The sound quality for the price range is excellent. It got a good Bass, treble could have been sharper. However the biggest issue with this headset, is that it's too tight on the ears ( and I dont have a very big face ).
After about 5 mins, your ears start to hurt ( literally hurt ).
So while, the sound may be good, it's of no use when you cannot use the head set for more than 10 minutes at a stretch.

2 stars only for the reason that these headsets are practically un-usable due to being too tight.",2
27,Best Over the head phones for the price it’s iffered at.,"I have been using the headphones since two days and I must say I am quite impressed. By looking at the photos of the product, I thought these are huge headphones. I was equally surprised to see the small box it came in when opened the Amazon packaging. After I took it out of the box, it felt really light in weight. The build quality of the headphones is good. You don’t feel in anyway that you are holding a cheap product. The fit is really snug. Good amount of cushioning for your years. There is a little bit of cushioning for the headband too which suffices the need. About the sound quality: Listening to music felt good. Nice bass, treble is good, you can hear every sound and tune clearly. However, I felt it needed a bit more sharpness. But hey, what all can you expect from a product at this price. I used it for calls. Voice quality is good. There is a fair amount of booze cancellation on the headphones. Microphone is powerful too. Overall and excellent product for its price. If you are looking for a over the ear headphones and for a good price.... this is your choice.",5
28,Awesome sound quality,"I will come straight to the point. These are infact a great pair of headphones - but only when you are traveling or require active noise cancellation. Otherwise these are just a decent pair.

I have been using this for a while with my laptop & iPhone, for watching Netflix & Prime Video (The Audio Source is anyways brilliant) & listening to music on Prime Music, again, the audio source is great, so I have got a decent experience with the headphones, with nice bass & decent mids. But when you turn the Active noise cancellation, the experience is in a different league - You wont hear any other voice in your vicinity. I have tested this in multiple flights as well. Even if you just turn the noise cancellation on, without any music, it will give a surreal experience, you won't be able to hear any in-cabin flight noise (engines etc.) It has actually helped me have a nice in-flight experience whether to just sleep or watch any movie.

Two things which could have been improved upon are -
1. With out Noise cancellation listening experience.
2. Re chargeable inbuilt battery could have been used.",5
29,Please suggest how can I repair it,I cannot hear any music from the right side,1
30,"It will give u goosebumps,beyond NiRVAnA. Go for it.👍","I have been using BOAT earphone since early thosand 18. And believe me guys this is truly beyond awesome. This is my first purchase after using SONY headphone, SONY is far behind from BOAt, as what i think, after using earphone/headphone of BOAT. I went for this headphone after earpiece of boAt & this is mind boggling. What a sound quality, Hats off 2 the makers of boAt. Awesome bass, treble , u r gonna hear each n every penny of sound clearly. U r gonna be totaly cutoff urself from outer world once u wear this headphone. Its material quality is very good, its totaly durable, light weight. I am giving this review after using 2 week. Dont hesitate go for it guys.",5
31,Very tight ear piece and loose 3.5mm connector.,"The ear-piece is so tight that ears get hurted within a few minutes of wearing it. It has unnecessary clockwise roation instead of anti-clockwise, such that bottom part of my ear doesn't get surrounded...

Even a 5% volume can be heard by a person behind me. And the connector works okay in my laptop, but falls very easily from my mobile phone. Overall product doesn't seems to be sturdy, the wires seems to be can be easily break with just a small strech due to rubber-like substance.

Last time I had used Mdr Zx110a which didn't had sound quality as this, but everything was sturdy, comfortable and still working after two years (with 35+ times falls from height and alot of streches), just that it got fungi right now due to moisture conditions...

There is no return, only replacement with same product available, I have placed just to be sure if its the problem with only this one or every piece got the same problem.",1
32,Bass ka meaning ..,So lets start with build quality it just perfect easily foldable and very light weight had a soft metal strip at top which adjustable according to your head.. the ear coups are small so had some problems with them so there is con and this is only con if u listen to music a lot it best to avoid this since long hours of usage causes pain especially near the ear drum ... Except all the sound quality is just amazing 10/10 for that boat .. also the bass is really good u wiuld be satisfied with that also had a microphone which sounds ok..,5
33,NOT MUCH SATISFIED 😞,"NOT SATISFIED,
1. AMAZING EXPERIENCE WITH MUSIC
2. NOT AT ALL GOOD FOR PUBG PLAYERS, YOU WON'T EXPERIENCE BACKGROUND MUAIC OF PUBG LIKE FOOT STEPS ECT.
3. MUSIC LEAKS VERY MUCH
4. MINE STOPPED WORKING UNDER 20 DAYS
5. IF YOU USE IT ROUGHLY THE AUX WILL DEFINITELY GET DAMAGE
6. THE CORD WIRE IS VERY VERY VERY LONG, WHICH IS VERY IRRITATING.
SOME LAST LINES:-:-
ONLY GOOD FOR MUSIC LOVERS, WHICH USE IT RARELY. NOT GOOD FOR GAMING OR ANYTHING ELSE.

34,Serious review (from a music producer),"(Ok so, headphones you buy should be based on who you are (music producer, audio engineer, DJ or a regular person).
For non-music produces (normal people):
This headphone is ideal for you. Please don't go for studio-quality or expensive headphones for only listening to music (because expensive headphones are for music producers and require a huge amount of power that can't be used with mobile). It comes with a small microphone in one of the wires, is foldable (easy to store even in small bags). BUT, the ear cups are really small to my ears, get heated quickly, so you can't wear it for a long time comfortably. This headphone can be used with all devices and doesn't need a lot of power like the expensive ones. And if you listen to podcasts, I don't recommend it because it is uncomfortable to wear and has bad noise cancellation feature. But if you use headphones for meetings and listening to music, this is perfect for you.

For music producers and mixing engineers:
I do not recommend these headphones for you. Because if we see the frequency response, it plays sounds from 20-10000 Hz (as far as I can hear). But it plays bass sounds more than other frequencies which can make you biased and wrong decisions while making music and mixing/mastering. Anywhen it comes to power, it is 80 ohms. So please don’t buy ANY cheap headphones for music producing and I recommend buying headphones that have frequency response clearly mentioned (20Hz to 20000Hz is good) with 250 ohms. Such studio-quality headphones are not cheap though. You can see more studio-quality headphone suggestions for producer s on YouTube.
Hope this helps :)",3
35,Recommend to Bass lovers,"It is very very good experience with this headphones. It is recommended to Bass lovers. Good sound quality.
Go through it.",5
36,Value for money.,"I brought this headphone for 750 Rupees. It's really easy to use and I like the sound quality of it. but the only one negativity is that it's very lightweight so from my point of view it can break very easily so should not put it down.
They gave this headphones with one year of warranty card so let's see how long it will be in good condition!! .and one more thing that It has good ratings and more then 30 thousand people brought this products that's why I believe it and brought it .( when its gets problem or not working that time I will update again about this headphones ) otherwise value for money.",4
37,Product Life exactly for 1 year Warranty period,"This Boat Ear phone of mine stopped working in the Mid of April 2020. It did'nt strike me then to check for the warranty period due to this Covid-19 lock down. Now that I am checking the old orders, I find that its just one year since I brought this product and the warranty too is 1 year. It lasted exactly for 1 year not more not less. So the immediate question that comes to my mind is ""Is this the quality of a reputed company ""Boat"" ? I have just missed the boat by few days and that too due to this Covid-19 lockdown. Will this qualify for replacement? Please let me know.",4
38,Great/Awesome/Amazing,"I'm writing the review after 20 months of purchasing and still it is working fine.
Pros:-
1.Best budget headphone with in line
microphone.
2.Great build quality
3.Impressive bass at this price segment
4.Durable
5.Good looking

Cones:-
No cones to discuss.you can't get better headphone than this at this price segment.

I had purchased the black one at Rs749 but price keeps on changing from 749-1399 and sometimes 2199 so if want to buy this at cheaper price wait for sometime.

Precaution- make sure to cover the wire by some protective layer otherwise after 1 year the wires will get several cuts due to folding so to avoid use some protective layer around wires and then you can use this for long time",5
39,Average headphone with more cons than pros,"Writing this review after using this headphone for 4+ months.
Pros:
Build and cable quality is good, no wear and tear in cables.
Tangle free.

Cons:
Absolutely 0 on noise cancellation. At 20% volume level, anyone near you can hear everything.
Painful to use for longer duration, ears starts hurting as the earpiece is not big enough and sits on the ears.
Cannot use it for longer duration.
Bass quality and audio quality is average.",1
40,Do not plan to purchase this product.,"Worst quality headphone.
Not suited for my kind of person's.
Honestly waste of money.
It produces more noise.
Causes earpain.
Not worthy.
Low class headphone.
It consists of many sharp corners that hurts our neck part.
Adjustment feature's not working properly.
Ear pad have less cushioning effect.

Everything I mentioned above is my honest review. After reading my Clause if you still wants to purchase this product means it's all up to you.",1
41,Product beyond expectation. Mind blowing awesome product,"It is a product beyond expectation. Mind blowing stunning product. Sound quality was awesome. Similar product as shown in image . It can easily adapt to our ear. It can be easily folded and is portable. It really worth money .Wonderful product in this range of price. Has an inbuilt in line microphone which allows hands-free call accepting
About the sound quality it is awesome. It is capable of giving the experience of my LG mini hifi system. With greater bass it is awesome.
It is really comfortable to put on ears due to soft cushion like thing provided at the earpiece. It also has a trendy look and is stylish. Sound leak was also less. I am using it from the day I got it and is using till now without any loss in sound quality. Superb product. Got no words to explain it.
Anyway I am satisfied with this product. Once again Amazon proved its quality. If you found this as helpful then please vote helpful below this review",5
42,Quality Package,"Well this Headphone will cater almost all your needs be it Sound Quality, Comfort, Build or Connectivity.
⚫ Sound
You get the best Bass ever if you have been using just earphones.
The bass is not irritating, it's quality Bass as I said. Since it is wired you won't compromise the sound for sure.
I used Real Original Sound Technology on my Realme 1 to boost Bass they gave awesome output, I love the quality.
⚫ Comfort
These are far comfortable than those wireless ones as this neither have battery nor Bluetooth driver so it makes it way lighter.
And regarding how long we can wear it in single use , don't worry about it as I haven't experienced any pain or so at all.
So you can definitely use if you are getting it for your long lectures for your study purpose.
Although I will update this section if I see any problem in my lecture sessions.
⚫ Build
Very comfortable and portable, infact these are flexible too , it takes only a space of a small notebook. The wire is of good length and made of good quality and the input aux has been given extra protection too.
⚫ Connectivity
Since it's wired there are no issues, just plug and use anywhere be it your phone , laptop or iPod .

I got it for Rs700 although sometimes it might be available even in 600.
Even if you get it in Rs800 you won't regret it all
I would say the best Sound experience I got ever just cause of this.
So go for this without any thoughts.",5
43,Pathetic,Honestly i didn't like the product at all.. the bass is not good as it claims high bass sound quality.. it's just ok.. secondly I couldn't even wear the headphone for even 5 min.. my ears started to pain.. i tried many times that that's what it is.. the ear pains.. i wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.. 749rs. Is not a small amount that can wasted on products like this.. A big No from my side..,1
44,Best budget headsets,"The headset is epic at this price point.
The one that make it really good is its bass .The plastics in this gear is also nice and well built.the 3.5mm audio jack in this headphone have a spring on its top and thus protect the cable from cracking or any breakage .The cushioning is also comfortable for this price range.The mic is not that up to the mark but good for this price.",5
45,Cool stuff.,"Nice product. Sound doesn't leak out of ear muffs even at high volume. It means the person next to you won't be able to hear what your girlfriend/boyfriend is talking to you. They can be folded and kept in your small bag.
Continuous use may cause some pain to your ear lobes. Use responsibly.
The claim the wire tangle free. Yes but to large extent.
Am I the only one who felt the length of the chord is too big?
Bought the white one, and it looks cool. People notice you a lot so wear nice clothes. Capitalise!",4
46,"Stopped working in 1 month, Service center is pathetic,","Sound quality and looks is very good, So purchased 3 headphones as such of same model.

One headphone stopped working in 1 month itself. Taken it to Ghaziabad Service center as it said 1 year warranty.

Service center staff inspected it visually and took it inside for verification. Later on returned saying that is has a vertical cut mark on wire some 1 feet from jack. There was no cut when it was given to them and its obvious they made a slight peel cut on wire to void warranty. That too its just a small peel mark on insulation which cant damage inside wires, still they have not entertained warranty.

Such experience was not expected from company like boat!!!! product is good till it works, dont buy seeing warranty support....because its just a eye wash",1
47,Good for the price and bass,"It's a good product, But certainly not the best. It fits tight on the ears and becomes painful wearing after 30 minutes. The tight grip allows you for better bass experience, and this headphone has quite a lot of it.
The wires are strong, and the ease with which you can carry this around is what makes it more interesting.
You buy this because of the price and bass, for that it's a bang on deal. For others who have different requirements and can't adjust with such tight grip and bass, please don't choose this.",4
48,Overall good product but not as good as motorola pulse 2,"Good product overall, but the ear pads are too large and the sponge is a bit unbreathable, comparing to Motorola Pulse 2 at similar proce point , clearly my preference would be Motorola Pulse 2 over this product.
I also feel a bit heavy/louder sound on the right earpiece compared to left one. But that might be clearly a problem with my hearing.
I miss the feature of a completely detachable and replacable headphone cable in this product , which is present in the pulse 2 which makes it really convenient for repairs and long life. If the cable is damaged in pulse 2 you can simple buy an aux cable and you headphone will be good as new. Also the detachable feature protecs the cable from tearing in case of a sudden jolt as the cable simply unplugs in motorola pulse 2.
I wish this feature will abe also available in boat headphones soon enough and that they also make thw ear pads more soft and breathable for extra comfort.",3
49,Best headphones under ₹1000,"The headphones are very comfortable. I am able to wear it for 1-2 hours without any problems.

Sound quality for the price is quite good. And mic works very well. My conference calls are much smoother now.

Noise cancellation is quite good for a basic product. If one was looking in sub ₹1000 range, look no further. Its money well spent.

I have had this for over a month now. Physical look and feel is very good.",5
50,Good Sound but NOT At All Comfortable,"These headphones have good sound quality. But the biggest problem is the comfort level. I and my family members (a total of 4 ) cannot wear this headphones for over 15-20 minutes, after that one starts to get external ear pain, there is definitely something wrong with the design of this headphone. The sound is good, one need not go over level 10/100 in a laptop.
Ear pain after 15 minutes is the biggest problem with this headset. Overall not a very good buy at Rs.800 as I cannot return it, somehow have to live with it or give it to some kids.",3
51,I love it,"Bought it in 799 INR. Writing buying rate is worth in any review cos it helps a new buyer to understand if it is expensive for them or how much increamnt have done the seller.
Let's come to the point.
Noise cancellation is 100% if you are using the highest volume.
Sound quality is also good but it is about 90%.
Bass quality is also equal to sound quality.
I don't no about built quality because I'm not expert in that so let see how long it will go..
Super fast delivery with prime membership in such pandemic situation.

I have small head with less hair to it is bit big for me 😅. See the pick for reference.",4
52,Good product. Don't wear for more than 3 hours.,"The headphones are really good. I brought them for 899 and thought it was worth it. I have been using them for more than a month now, but they are as good as new.

The packaging though was very odd. But you can still use the box. The best part about the headphones is it's spring attacher- the place where headphones connect to the phone, it is very durable and won't cut. It has a steel spring connector.

So, go for this headphones if yiur budget is below 1k and you don't want to fall in the hassle of charging bluetooth headphones.",4
53,Not very reliable after some time,"Headphones have become quite the necessity in these pandemic days of online existence. Whilst they might look sturdy, the majority of them end up looking the worse for wear because of the constant use and contact with sweat. they also develop all kinds of problems, such as the sound coming only through one ear, or crackling, sooner rather than later. No headphone of mine, irrespective of price, has survived for more than two years. This one was also no different. Had to discard it after two years because the sound stopped coming. Before that, there was an odd problem where the head phone took over the YouTube controls and the video would start and stop randomly. Battery life wasn't also all that great.",3
54,The fitting is uncomfortable.,"Dont fall for the large number of ratings.

The headphones fit very uncomfortably tight over the ears.
Plus the earpads are very small.
It is difficult to wear them for even 15 minutes.

Warning to potential buyers - this product is non-returnable and can only be replaced.",1
55,Worth buying,"I love this headphone. Got it for 599. Totally worth for the money. Sound quality is so nice. Every background sounds could be heard accurately. I was surprised at first about how accurate it is. Because I am hearing something that I haven't without this darling and it was so pleasant. The mic and the button on it come handy. Compatible with both my laptop and phone.

Many reviews told that ot was tight and had to do something to loosen up. But I find it most comfortable. You might experience a little pain in ear if you use it for long hours (like more than 6 hours continuously) in beginning. But I don't have that issue anymore.

The price too changes often with the offers. If you are searching for a overhead earphone in nominal price go for it. I'm using it for about 3 months. Absolutely in loving with it.",5
56,No longevity: Forget Longevity there is no Mediumgevity either.,"It works for a period of time then it stops working.Bought this product in June 2018,it worked well for 2 months but then the sound quality was disbalanced By September, got it fixed , received the product after 2 weeks, worked well for 2 months then it stopped working in january,got it fixed, received it after 2 weeks and it was working until February end ,when it stopped working on one side again.I don't know what they do with this product, it stops working again and again.I requested for getting it fixed but the pickup agent says the wire is damaged.If it is damaged, it has been damaged by Boat who give bad products again and again under a guise of warranty.I don't understand how a product could stop working 3 times within 8 months.Please don't buy this or any boat products.",1
57,Value for money...,"As I am working from home, a lot of time is spent on calls. I bought these as in-ear earphones were getting uncomfortable for long calls. These headphones are really comfortable.. doesnt hurt my ears .. sound quality is really good... amazing for both calls and listening to music... keep the mouthpiece closer to your mouth while speaking...rest all is good for this price range...",5
58,Satisfactory & Optimal Performance Headphones,"I was somewhat skeptical because I had never used boAt before, but it seemed pretty good from the product description, so I went for it. I must say, I'm extremely impressed with the quality of these headphones.

Pros:

1. Fantastic Sound Quality
2. Great Noise Cancellation Feature
2. Well Balanced Bass
3. Adjustable Bands and Rotatable Speakers allow for a very Snug Fit and Compact Storage
4. Very Robust
5. High Clarity Mic and Control Button

Cons:

1. Earmuffs Cause Slight Ear Pain After a While so Makes It Difficult to Wear for Too Long
2. Short Wire May Cause Some Length Problems
3. No Volume Control Buttons

Rating: 9.5/10, One of the Best Headphones in This Price Bracket",5
59,Amazing !!!! Worth the price !!!!,"I already have a boat head phones (the bluetooth ones ).. I had bought those some decades back.. I just love those headsets.. my mom wanted an wired headphone since her JBL headphone is not working properly... This time I thought of trying a Boat wired headphone for her thinking it may be as good as mine and quiet advanced .. since mine is an old version.. and because of the Amazon festival I got it quiete cheap and it got delivered today just a few minutes ago.. I tried the headset myself...
The quality is amazing ..
The look is amazing....
The colour is amazing...
Its light weight ... ( Mine the old bluetooth headset is very heavy )
Its not hard or too tight on the ears ( it doesn't press hard on the ears ) like the bluetooth headset I have..
The sound system and bass is amaxing...
Overall I am very happy and satisfied that I have selected the right brand for the headset for my mother ..
I would definitely recommend this product..it's worth the price..
I was looking out for normal earphones for my phone I know which brand I have to go for The Boat one for sure ..",5
60,So-so,"I was advised by the doc not to use ear phones that go inside the ear, so I opted for this after reviews. I am using it with the Samsung phone. Not sure if the phone is bad, or network coverage is bad - since i started using it, no one is able to hear anything properly; i am not able to hear them also properly - had to disconnect calls multiple times. Finally, i ditched this headset, and am just holding the phone close to my ear and going without using hands-free.",3
61,"Very avoidable if you have a little more money, look for other options","The build quality is good, happy with that, good packing BUT the overall sound is very bad. Has no highs, hardly any mid, just a lot of bass. The over all sound quality is kinda muffled and low ranged. Unless you really boost with an eq aligned heavily to mid and highs you won't like the sound. I made a mistake and bought 2 donated one already. Suggest you not buy if you want good balanced sound. Ordered 2 together and got them in different time lines not happy with that",2
62,Great bass. Love it. Go for it.,"Great. I love it. Sound is very heavy. Bass is great. Sometimes the bass is so high that it is not tollarable. You always have to keep the system bass at the lowest. I got it just for Rs. 540.
The quality of the headphone is good. The wire quality is great. The spring connecting the wire and the 3.5mm jack is great and very useful in terms of longitivity.
One can purchase the headphone if someone loves bass.",5
63,Painful review,Everything was good at first.. Sounds were great. But then the pain slowly crept in.. Too be precise the anti helical fold part of the ear suffers the most pain due to the pressure of the earpads.. The ear pads is the only con on this head phone.. But not gonna return it cos i use these head phones for listening to sounds tat i dont want to be heard outside(if u know wt i mean..lasts only for 5 to 10 mins..😂). Would not recommend this.,2
64,One of the wow products,"Just wow product. I just starting using it however it has amazed me in every way. Amazing sound quality, good mic and fair enough noise cancellation however it will depend on which area you are using it like if you are near heavy traffic area, horn sounds will be issue however overall an amazing product. I will recommend to everyone. Thank you Amazon for amazing delivery as always 😊",5
65,Good sound and decent passive noice cancellation but mic is not working after 2 months,"I really liked the product, it had good sound, good bass, was comfortable and good call but the mic is malfunctioning after a month or so and my voice is not auidable to other person on the line. Still good with sound, but doesn't help me if I don't have mic and I use it a lot for office calls.",2
66,Seems duplicate,Doesn't seem original. Came in brown cardboard box which had a sticker of boat inside. Probably the seller forgot to stick it. It won't fit an adult head will hurt in a while. Since I took it for my toddler he is able to adjust. Seems duplicate. Lots of disturbance each time the wire moves. Please purchase from a good outlet like chroma etc.i exchanged and still the second one too was the same. There is no return available sadly.,1
67,Good headphone at low budget.,"Good headphone at low budget. Look, feel and sound quality are it's pros.

16th October 2019: after 10 month of use left side of headphone stop working. Don't know how to get it repaired, warranty is 1 year so looking for option to get it repaired. No support information can be seen in Amazon.

One more issue as everyone highlighted is hard on ear, ear starts paining after 30 minutes use in any conference call.

9th November 2019: I got customer care detail of boat from Google easily. I logged the complaint and received replacement in 4 weeks. I have rated it back to 5 star for it wonderful service. No follow up is required , once logged complaint someone will come to pick faulty product, details will be shared via email and sms. Same need to be checked for update. Follow up action will be updated via sms and mail and final solution Will be provided in 3-4 weeks time. Same is also written in sms and mail.",5
68,"Good sound, Poor voice call, normal built quality","Hello guys I just received this headset. Sound is really good. But wait read my reviews carefully. Its not for all.

1) Amazing sound quality for bass lovers. Sure extra bass
2) if u are hearing in medium to high volume the person's near u will. Hear lots of sound of ur track.
3) definitely not good for voice call its bit boss effects. Which makes very unclear voice.
4) am really afraid that it might break in rough use. So use it will care.
5)Good for music's, YouTube, movies etc. At this price go for it.",4
69,The best,"I bought it 2.5 years ago and writing review today.. around 5 months after purchasing it, all of a sudden it stopped working. I claimed the warranty and they had repaired it. And after that there wasn't any issue except the mic stopped working, so I can't use it for answering calls.
But till today it is my choice of use while watching movies, listening songs etc. Even the Bluetooth headset stands at 2nd place..
Bass and sound quality is 100%",5
70,Mic stopped working after 9 days.,This was brought for my child due to the online classes that are on going. He has been complaining that at times his teachers could not hear him and today it just stopped working. Yiu can hear well but mic is bust and the best part it happened right after the returns policy expired and cannot contact anyone for it. Cant say the product is good or bad as i have used Boat products never found any issues earlier.,2
71,Quality not good,"I don't use this headphone that frequently and with proper handling , all the synthetic covering of the headphone ears are gone and it looks disgusting, not sth you want to put on your ears in a office.
I guess its an area where Boat has to work on.
No one wants to buy a headphone every year.
Lets go a sustainable way",2
72,"Painful at first, but useful for conferences, after loosening it.","Okay, let's start by saying that you will not get anything like this at this price point. Considering that, this headphone can be easily used for video calls, it's actually pretty great for this which is my primary use case for it. Vocals sound a teeny tiny bit heavy or boom-y, because a large part of the spectrum that it can cover is occupied by very heavy, and not pleasing bass. But you wouldn't notice it if this is your only pair of headphones or if you are not used to better headphones/earphones.

Coming to music, unless you're a total basshead, you wouldn't be able to tolerate the boominess of it, there's too much of base at every frequency of its very limited spectrum, and honestly it gets very tiring after a while because of the heavy bass. This fact is compounded by the fact that these are NOT, I repeat, NOT comfortable, especially if you're wearing glasses with thick handles, even considering the adjustments you can make to make it fit better. There is a remedy however, mentioned by another reviewer. Use a book or anything and put the headphones over the book, for a day or two, and it should loosen up enough for you to wear, for a longer duration.

Having said all that, I don't listen to music, neither watch movies with this thing on. I only use this for video conferencing, and apart from the headache I got from the tightness of the headphones, I am VERY satisfied with the product. It actually becomes usable after it's loose enough without your head exploding. It is very cheap, and honestly, there's nothing like it out there at this price. You can usually find it for Rs. 800-900, don't buy it for a higher price, NOT worth it. Ciao!",3
73,It's a good deal,"So I purchased it yesterday the delivery was fast I love it since it's compact and can be carried easily without wire tangling

Quality of the product is good it's comfortable on the ear n sounds obviously we need to adjust it over a phone so many comments of this product saying ear pain but it's not I can vouch for that just keep the volume mid to listen to anything you need whereas this product is just apt it's also light in weight",5
74,Wonderful headset for great price,"With hesitation orderd this product after great disappointment with Sony headsets.This packing looks neat and simple.Build quality is perfect for this price.Top feature is the sound.For the first time i'm able to hear deep back ground sounds which is surprising.When connected to laptops to take webex calls,the call clarity is wonderful.Over mobile as well when connected is great.I'm satisfied with the product and ready to buy blutooth version....overall a great product which can be used by kids and professionals.",5
75,After 1month of used,"#Quality of sound Not good when used with calling, sound use to get break up.
#No volume control
# single button for call rejection only.
# use to get ear pain after 30 min of use.
# soft ear pad,doesnt cover ear. it's over the ear.
# noise reduction is mild not much.
#overall sound experience is good. Can buy for intermittent use, not prolong use.
# cord length is good 1.5metre.
#black or dark color better, white color absorb dirt fast and difficult to clean off
So it's 3/5.",3
76,Good for daily use,"I am writing this review after 5 months. This product is absolutely good. Even at high sound I cannot hear any distortion or anything. So sound quality is the best. It is not a noise cancelling headphone so can't talk about it. Its noise isolation is good. Nothing from outside comes inside and nothing from inside goes outside. Its bass quality is amazing. It fits perfectly on the ear only in one position but when it does, its supercomfy. It is also compact so you can carry it when you are on a journey.
Sound clarity : 8/10
Mic : 9/10
Comfort: 9/10

This is an edition of the review after a year of rough use. Now It's been a year and I've been using it daily about 7 hours a day. The mic stopped working but I don't use the mic often. The soft fabric coating on the ear cushions literally ""shed"" and now the foam is only remaining. But even the foam is very soft for my use. Even now it is comfortable on the ears.
Sound clarity : 8/10
Mic : 0/10
Comfort : 9/10",4
77,Great Bass & Sound + uncomfortable !!,"Bass is amazing although mids does sound a bit muddy. I like the wire and build quality and for 600 cant get better than that. Good for listening music/videos etc.
However, what is the point when you cant wear these for more than 30 mins!! My ear starts paining especially left earlobe coz of these headphones. Seems like a design fault, as they swivel towards outside than inside. This creates a less flexible option when you wear it. So trying to use left side on right ear and right side on left ear. That has sorted the issue a bit!
Good for 20 to 30 mins music.. Dont try it for playing games... Your earlobes will hurt and pain.. Plus using the opposite sides of left/right of headphones to ease pain... will cause immense confusion of footsteps in games!!",4
78,Value for money,"Value for money. Finish is good & it's reasonably compact to store & carry.

Audio quality meets expectations for a product at this price. Nothing phenomenal though.

On the ear, reasonably comfortable but be aware that despite the soft padding, if you're going to be using this for hours on end, you're better of with an over the ear headphone 🎧.",4
79,The best headphones under this budget.,I can guarantee you that you cannot find better headphones under this price point. The headphones have a great amount and quality of bass for all the bass lovers out there. Sound quality is awesome.. Wire is thick and durable with a protective spring attached to its jack. The only downside is the looks. Not very attractive and mic cannot work with pc.,5
80,Decent product,"I haven't t purchased many headphones in my life so i don't know much but I bought this after seeing these good reviews here and belive me! You won't regret.. Sound quality is good, bass is awesome, build quality is good but the cable is too long and these headphones are a little bit uncomfortable due to small ear cups and after long usage the ears start to pain.. If you are ok with that just go with these! I also played games on this and in PUBG you can hear footsteps and other important sounds very clearly even from a distance.. Its good for watching movies too. Overall a decent product but if they added more comfortable ear cups it would have been better.",4
81,Experience the Magic,better than normal earphones since it has big sound due to large drivers. i bought it to listen music on high volume. so if you are music lover and want to experience the magic of Surround Sound Systems then go for it without any hesitation. Using it first time is giving a little earpain.. not much but i am ok with it. More head movement gives more pain. i will get used to with it after some time. I am happy with my purchase since i got it for 674. Use it carefully since the area where earcups are attached looks delicate.,5
82,Awesome product. Want to give more than 5 star for doorstep pickup for warranty.,"I git this for 599 ₹ only, and this was awsome. I user this head phone for 2.5 years unfortunately wire got damaged. Once I claim it's warranty and boat's door step pickup is awesome. I really impressed with this service and now I use smart watch too of boat , Why I can't give boat more than 5 star??? I only buy headphones of boat. Because of doorstep pickup for warranty.",5
83,"Good product, but not the best one from Boat! Combo of lightweight design and amazing bass.","Honestly, this is the first product of boat which I am not much of a fan. I used to love every product of boat until I used it. It's not like the usual boat products which give you extraordinary sound quality in the low budget price. It has cheap rate and accordingly cheap sound quality. But as usual, Boat has done an amazing work to maintain its premium build. Looks like a premium headphones. Also the bass is as usual a notable plus point of these headphones. Also unlike others said in the reviews, I don't feel any ears pain even after using them continuously for 5 hours. These are very lightweight so you don't feel any uneasiness while wearing them.
Overall it can be said if you are looking for headphones with average sound quality and great build in a low budget cost then this is perfect for you.",4
84,Light-weight with loud and clear sound - Go for it!,"Beautiful headphone from Boat. Its light weight and you can use it for hours on your head. Although your ears will start paining after a while which happens with almost all the headphones.
Sound is loud and clear. Listening to music files will be a soothing experience. Although it could have even better sound quality but at this price, I don't mind what it delivers. Mic works very well too. I bought it for making calls for my business over Skype. I am using Skype on my phone to make calls and it works pretty good for me. Thanks to boat.",4
85,So far Good!!,"I Got the BoAt BassHeads 900 and used it for 2 days so far. Not bad at all for the price. Sound is satisfactory n comfortable on ears. Sound is pretty loud so i keep it on lesser than 50% volume. Mic function works well too when used on video calls on mobile n laptop. Some reviews talk about the headset hurting the ears after long usage but I did not find any issue like that at all. Used it to watch a movie of 2 hrs continuously n no pain at all. Infact very comfortable on ears n soft cushioning. Noise cancellation is also satisfactory. Dont hear much of outside noise nor does sound leaks out to others.
Got it mainly for my son for online classes, he’s in 4th Std and fits his smaller head perfectly too with no pain or discomfort.
Very sleek look and foldable too which i really like.
Just hoping its performance remains good for longer period. If any change will surely update the review after longer use.",3
86,Great experience in 800 INR,"Simple review-Awesome bass, awesome sound quality, excellent loudness, good enough noise cancellation, fine comfort in wearing, headband is soft, ear cushions are a bit rough though they still don't hurt unless you wear them for like more than 2 or 3 hrs, great metallic body, the cable- just great designed, doesn't tangle and has a spring at the connector side to prevent sharp curves in the wire great job done here, mic quality is ok not bad not too good great for a 800 rs product. To be simple-best value for money product👌. BoAt nailed it👍👌",5
87,Conparitively good sound quality,"It has a good sound quality for its price of Rs 800. This was my first ""headphone"" so it did taught me a few things. So lets talk about them, the only deal breaker for me was its comfort as it is an on ear headphone it does feel a lot uncomfortable even if you wear it for just 1 hour. It have realise after using these headphones that i hate on-ear headphone and *comfort is far more important aspect to consider than the sound quality* (at least for me).If you are planning to use your headphone for long hours then I don't recommend this headphone to you. If you want a comfortable headphone there are very few options at this price range, you could go for a gaming headphone as they are very comfortable due to their over the ear design if you can't extend your budget.
(I bought them in November 2018 and I did replaced them once after a year and half due to some audio issue)
Comfort - 2/5
Sound quality - 3.5/5
i guess this review might have help you
Thank you😊",3
88,Opened and tempered,I received a product which without doubt was opened before delivery. The seal was broken and the flaps were not put back by whoever did it. The pictures show exactly how I received the product. Either I have been tricked with a second hand product or the delivery guy opened it. Either way for the amount I paid for the item the least amazon can do is to make sure the products are new and not tampered with.,1
89,Disappointing after initial good performance,"After 3 days of usage
Good sound quality, decent mic, and don't need to hold mic close to mouth to sound clear for recipients.
Works quite well for MS Teams and Skype calls.

Post 3 months usage:
Mic quality has dropped down significantly. I need to hold mic close to mouth while speaking, quite frustrating and at times annoying. Didn't expect this with just a few months of usage.
Don't buy this product.",4
90,Better than JBL/Sony/Panasonic headphones in this Price range,"I have used JBL headphones in this price range but they don't provide Mic !

I have used Sony/Panasonic headphones in this price range but they don't have Base and sound clarity as BOAT !

I will strongly recommend this BOAT headphone to get overall best experience in this price range .",5
91,Warranty claim approved.,"I got my headphone replaced yesterday. I am satisfied, my warranty claim wad approved. It could be the same one repaired or new one for it. Anyhow I am happy and changing my review.

Call the customer service no first and raise your complaint. They will send someone to pickup the damaged product. Then they check the damage and replace it.

Old review: Its wire got damaged after 2 months of purchase. I wrote an email to claim a warranty and it had been 2 and half week now. There is no response from Boat. After sales customer service seems to be pathatic. It appears, they don't value a customer at all. If I don't get any response within a month from a warranty claim request. I will share my experience on all the social media platform to make sure others know how much they value their customers. In total I have like more than 10000 people listed with me on all the platforms.",4
92,True pure bass headphones!,"It's been a day since I've got this product.

Why i liked these headphone?

First of all, the sound quality is just amazing. I'm not gonna elaborate on this since these are just perfect.

Secondly, if you're not a bass head then you would hate these! Cause these are true bass heavy headphones, take my word on that.

Conclusion, if you are running low on budget and want to grab a good pair of over ear headphones then go for these.
Luckily I got this 500 on the sale day which is awesome! Enjoy the music.",5
93,Review of Boat headphone,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 So forgot to talk about audio quality.
Amazing sound quality I have got. Bass quality is ok as competitors are giving better may be cost is a constraint. I didn't find it as good noise cancellation featured device.

Over all I'm very happy with the device.",5
94,Fantastic value for money,"Cost to performance ratio is excellent.
The build quality is good too. A bit too bass for my taste, however, it is not a complaint.
I am primarily using it for virtual meetings and it performs brilliantly.
A bit painful after a while, especially if one wears it with mask or spectacles. Fits too tightly on the ears.
The cushions seem durable though.",5
95,Delivers what it says in the price range.,"After 2 months of usage. The build quality is really good I can wear them confidently without fear of breaking. Bass is good and you can actually feel the thumps in your ears. Only con I found given the price is sound leak and also they are little uncomfortable to wear when they are new for long hours after sometime it gets better.
Also the metal audio jack with spring protection is a good touch increases the durability.",5
96,Very good headset,"This is one of the best headphones available on Amazon in the price range of below 1000.
It is very comfortable to the ears with good amount of cushion given. The mic is also of a decent quantity.
The wire length is also good and the sound quality is also good

If you are looking for a basic headset around 800-900 rupees I would recommend Boat.

I have purchased three of them, one after the other over period of 2 to 3 years",5
97,Another addition to a Boat-head like me,"This is my 11th boat headphone and that goes to show how much I have come to trust this brand of headphones.

I have previously (and currently) owned these audio devices from Boat:
1. Boat Stone 260 (Oct 2017)
2. Boat Stone 600 (May 2018)
3. Boat Bassheads 225 (Sept 2018 - 1no , Oct 2018 - 3nos)
7. Boat Rockers 265 (Feb 2019)
8. Boat Stone Granade XL (May 2019)
9. Boat Bassheads 242 (Aug 2020)
10. Boat Bassheads 900 (July & Sept 2020)

It is a value for money product, affordable and most importantly, an Indian brand.

'nuf said!",5
98,Good sounding but bad build quality.,"Used it for a few months now. Good pair in terms of sound quality. Since the earcups' outer part is made up of iron, the paint on it quickly wears off and rust begins to form.
It definitely does not look good after that. It began rusting after 3-4 months but the sound quality is still exception at this price point. The cable is long and durable. Tried to use it during online call but the persons on the other end complain that my voice is low and inaudible during most occasions (began happening after 2 months)
Sound quality 4/5
Noise cancellation 3/5
Bass quality 4/5

If you want long lasting and great looking headphones, go for Sony plastic cup types (but don't expect a soundstage or bass or volume as good as this Boat pair).",4
99,"Robust design, bad choice of materials.","Would not recommend these headphones: the earpads are made out of leather and the headphones are too tight.

This leads to the leather being pushed against your ears with quite a lot of force. Although decently comfortable at first, it quickly becomes uncomfortable; your ears start paining.

Since this is leather, your ears' heat is quickly absorbed by the leather too. In around 5-10 mins, it becomes very warm due to your body heat, making it even more uncomfortable to wear. There is a noticeable difference in temperature when you take it off for a few minutes and then wear it again.

So if you wear it for more than 20 mins, you can expect your ears to hurt a lot, and also be a few degrees hotter than the rest of your body (which doesn't help with the pain).

It could've been a 5/5, recommendable product. But, due to the aforementioned problems, it's become a 3/5 and non-recommendable due to how uncomfortable it is to wear for extended periods of time.

The hinge is also subpar; it's a little plastic that can easily wear out. After a few minutes of turn the cups around, it wore away enough to the point where it no longer works",3
100,Sits really tight - headset stopped working in 3 months,"Although it's excellent sound quality and feels like value for money at first glance, please be wary that the headphones sit very tight - ears feel the pain of the grip. It's also not a one size fits all. There is room to adjust for various head sizes but it's still loose for me at the top! Last, if you're looking for a headset cum headphone, the headset feature stopped working for me in 3 months. I can't use this for my phone and work calls anymore.
Apart from that, the sound quality is really good and there are no problems with headphones other than the above.",2
101,Good Quality,"Very good quality for the price range. The sound and the mike quality is good. I use it on my laptop for work purpose, talking to my team on Google Hangouts or Microsoft Team.

Pros:
1. The sound and mike quality is good. This was the main purpose of buying this headphone.
2. The springs attached at the end of the pin, helps pull out the wire in case it gets pulled. This is really helpful.
3. The cable is pretty long

Cons: None

Small concern: On long usage I experience some discomfort on my ears and have to remove the headset for a while. But it is an indicator how snugly it fits over your ears.

The best one perhaps in this price range.

I have a standby PTRon Studio Lite Stereo Sound Wired Headphones. Compared to PTRon, Boat is a true winner in terms of reliability and sound quality.",4
102,Honest Review after speculating,"I am writing this review after looking over these headphones properly. In this price range, You can't expect to get more. If you are a school student or college student, then go for it. Though, yes the sound quality is not as good as i expected, but still it's not a huge difference. I switched from boat bassheads 225 that's why I had some problems with sound. As for the comfort, I saw many reviews saying that these are not comfortable, well to me, they are really really comfortable, you have to notice how you are wearing them.
Overall, these Headphones are amazing, if your budget is lower than 1000rs., Go for it.",5
103,Boat Basshead vs. Skullcandy headdphones,"Much better than my old Skullcandy (left) headphone which costed twice. The bass from boat Basshead is just addictive & feels like a subwoofer attached to your ears. Skullcandy pales in comparison with hardly any bass.

Worth the price. Shipped superfast. Got it next day. Does not advertise to have noise cancellation, but when the music is on you can hardly hear surrounding sound. It's like ""Being in a different World"". Not much wearing discomfort due to adjustable frame.",5
104,"If you are looking for a cable headphone, go for it","Its been a long time, and I am still here to write a review about it. It was a really a great buy. It still works well after 2+ years. The sound quality is good, even the bass quality is good as I have checked, with every headphones I had a issue with their jack but this headphone comes like a jack saver (life saver reference). If you are considering this headphone for vocal recordings then it might disappoint you. There is some noise while recording. However it sounds good on video call n call so if you are looking for video calls and zoom meetings than its good.",5
105,It is very nice 👍,"It is a good headphones . I used for a month.
At first your outer ears might pain due to compression of headphone 🎧 (not of sound or radiation). Once u are used to it , then perfect. I by mistake kept the volume 100 then I was able to hear the audio outside but feeble . The sound clarity is nice . Still now no negative. Caution : don't wear any headphone for hours and hours. You should get air circulation in your ears",5
106,Good sound quality,"The good thing about the headphone is its sound quality as well as bass quality. But the cable, particularly the mic section, is delicate and poorly designed. I bought one on 26th June, its mic got damaged on 29th June. So ordered one more on 29th June just because I liked it otherwise and the price is reasonable.",3
107,What should you expect from this headphones?,"For the price it's a good deal, it's a good headphone for the price DO NOT compare it with Sony or JBL or other bigger brands, if you are then make sure you do compare the prices first then judge over it. The headphones are light weight and are very portable, wire is springy so it won't tangle wire is long enough. It has a mic too. Overall a great headphones for the price, if you are on budget have no doubt go for it.",4
108,Awesome product with awesome customer service,"Awesome product and awesome customer service. Writing this review after a year use. First I ordered the BOAT BASSHEADS 900 PEARL WHITE headphone in jan 2020 which functioned pretty well but in jan 2021(within warranty period with 16 days remaining) the mic malfunctioned and low voice was transmitted. I claimed for warranty and they responded by giving me brand new CARBON BLACK HEADPHONE(same brand).
Awesome product by boat 😊😊. Good bass and voice quality satisfied with the headphone.
Photos added.",5
109,A comfortable high quality headphone for daily use,"I gave this to my 10 year old son for his online classes. He is very happy about this product. According to him, the Sound quality is very good and the headphone covers his ears comfortably. The microphone is very good. I used it and found it to be true. The cables are of good quality. Adults who got used to in-ear headphones, may find it uncomfortable to have it on the ears for a longer time. This is because , since the ears are fully covered, after half an hour or so, we start feeling the heat. But my son does not like in-ear phone as it pains for him and is also was very fragile for sudden pulls.
Overall we are happy with this product and would recommend for anyone preferring an over- head headphone!",5
110,Good Product for minimal time usage,"Writing this review after using this product for 3 days.
1. sound quality is good.
2. the material(ear puffs , wire , plastic ..etc ) looks decent and gives a shiny look
3. mic functionality is pretty impressive and even catches a small noise/sound

cons:
1. my ear (top part) starts paining if i continously use it for 2 hrs, due to small sized puffs
2.High volume or loud sound is transparent which makes the other person hear what you are hearing .

Overall this product is a good fit for minimal time users with good budget range",1
111,Light weight yes go for it,"Speaker are good . Got in sale R.s 799 ..
This time my cretrtia was headphone should be loud and should be light weight

this one satisfies both so keeping this ty amazon ty boat

one down side i feel is wire is like rubberish could have given threaded wire apparat from that Seems all ok",4
112,Best buy for the price,"It’s perfect for that price. I purchased it for my kids to attend online classes. No point in comparing it with Apple apm, XM4 or Bose 700. Sound signature is leaning towards bass. Overall, excellent for that price. Amazon wants me to review noise cancellation. I guess they mean PNC and not ANC.",5
113,Bass lovers these are one of the loudest headphones I have ever used !,"Boat bassheads 900 is purely bass oriented headphones if your one who loves thumps bass these are for you and trust me these are better then even more expensive headphones that might cost you around 10k but only in terms of bass , treble is okay , hi are average mids are less then average and you will never notice lows because of boosted bass 😂 about durability I had to exchange them 4 to 5 times in period of 2 years mainly due to audio Jack is bit fragile also the cable will wear out within 8 to 9 months over all best headphones if you love bass !",5
114,Quality Product with many adjustments. Only drawback: Voice leakage + Loose jack.,"Over the past decade the headphone quality has improved dramatically. I remember how the headphones then used to hurt after wearing for some time and were very fragile.

Compared to now everythings changed. I prefer Boat because its products have proved to always last long. This headphone has a lot of adjustments which will help you get used to it easily.

Edit: 4 months update: Working well as it was on Day 1. No issues for now

Edit 2: 5 month update. Many issue can be seen. Voice leakage. Others next to you can listen to the music you are listening to easily. The jack has become loose and need to adjust it sometimes on phone or laptop to listen clearly. Downgrading my raring from 4 to 2.",2
115,Not durable at all,Bough this product only 2 months back and it has started giving me troubles. I am facing this issue of bad sound quality since last 2 weeks and I have not received any response from BOAT. I have tried registering the product on their support website but haven't received any registration code or not even an acknowledgement. Very unhappy with the product and BOAT service.,1
116,"Love it so much, 4th headphone broke bought the 5th one","Sound quality amazing, I keep breaking my head phone bcoz of u sleep on it or sit on it. If u r carefully this head phone is awesome, last headphone was chewed up by my puppy, I ordered this headphone right away.

4 headphone later, 2 years non stop use later, I can say. Simply buy it. It will be a great addition to your headphones collection or simply use this as a basic headphone.",5
117,Best and probably better than sony of same price,"Sound is great
Comfortable
Cord protection is also there
Left and right difference is also there so that it's comfortable for both ears not pressing on them, wire is long enough to keep for a distance
Mic is also there for talking
Sound level is better than sony white headphone that I bought for 700 though this is 749.",5
118,Very good quality and sturdy.,"I've been using this headphone for over a month. Must say, it has not just met.. it has exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is excellent. I keep the volume to minimum and can still hear the audio clearly. The mic is also working fine, no issues and people at the other end can hear me clearly. Noise cancellation is not perfect, but I'm not complaining as I was not looking out for this feature. Works well on all devices. The overall built, cable thickness and mettalic jack gives a feel that this one will last for many years!!
Even if it gets damaged or I lose them, I will go for a repurchase 😁😁",5
119,Great wired headphones at a low cost,"I have a couple of bluetooth headphones but the call quality leaves a lot to be desired. The mic has lot of distortion. That is why I went for a simple wired option. Boat Bassheads does not disappoint. The music is crisp and clear with a lot of bass. The voice quality is great, they weigh very less and do not press on the ears (I wear spectacles). Plus point is they can be folded neatly. Sceptical about the ear padding seems to be very ordinary - let's see how much it would last. Worth buying.",5
120,Boat Headphone - worth buying it,"I bought three headphones of Boat ( same color & model) for my children's online school purpose, all three are going on well. very comfortable, Children are using it for the last 1.5 months, no issues till now. it's a good buy I recommend.",4
121,Review of boat bassheads 900,"Positive:
Good sound clarity, Hi-quality product, Good fit for ears and head,soft pads,good bass, thicker wire and good AUX, spring in AUX is good for long life of item, highly attractive design. Easy returns and refunds.
AMAZON SERVICES ARE VERY GOOD AND SATISFIED.(NOT PRODUCTS).
Negatives:
This item not for long use ,when we use long time get start pain in our ears. Hi lose of battery persentage in mobiles. 'L'-shaped AUX is always good for mobiles.We can't use heardphone while laying on the bed,it is most difficult for sleeping, Not the item goes to little brother's hand next day he gives you two one-sided headphones.
AFTER 4 DAYS THE HEADPHONE STOPPED WORKING.THIS PRODUCT IS WASTE.",4
122,Experience of 2yr usage & also the Replacement process with Boat,"I purchase these headphones in Oct 2018, editing my review now in Oct 2020.
CONS(before replacement by Boat):-
- cheap build quality
- durability is not that much, earcups got loose
- little uncomfortable on the ear, but you'll get used to it.
- wire was not good
- base problems
PROS(before replacement by Boat):-
- quite good sound quality in this price range.
- Mic is good
#Earcups got loose, then I had to replace them just after the 1st month (Replacement process took around 18 days)

-Earcups got tight after the replacement, nothing else.
-After 2-3 months started having crackling sound, then right side stopped working.
- Replaced them around march 2019 (took 20 days)
# Experience after the 2nd replacement:-
CONS-
- little uncomfortable on the ear, just like before.
PROS-
- durability was good.
- wire has a good quality, guess it was changed
- Earcups & the folding mechanism was working upto the point, durability was good now.
- sound was okay & the bass improved.
- mic was already good.
Note:-
1. You need to register the product on their website, it took me 6-7 times to register my headphone, cuz of their site issues.
2. They'll give you no. to call on, but it'll never connect.
3. When you go to their service centre they can't take your headphones, they only take earphones. Service centre personnel said that they don't take this product. I mean I traveled 2 hours just to shock myself, service centre never picked the call.
3. Replacement takes too much time cuz of courier service they use.()
4. This model's service center is only in mumbai. In my case it took 18-19 days on avg basis for: delhi->mumbai->delhi

Speacial Note:
# Maybe the Seller is selling the diminished quality products or idk, cuz durability, sound & base improved after the replacement.
# In this price range of 600-850 these are bang for bucks, but you may have to replace it.
# Now after 1.5 yrs after the 2nd replacement, wire near the plug is damaged by normal wear & tear, but it is still working fine, but yeah I guess their time is coming.",3
123,Not a quality product,"The product have an issue on the 4 th day ,I have raised an complaint to boat customer care as it’s covered under warranty. But they have sent auto generated email to approach service center which is 40 kms away from my place.No response from customer care call which shows always no response.
Suggest not to opt this product. Hope this would be helpful.",1
124,Thank you Amazon,"Boat is awesome in this category, and Amazon is providing this in such a cool price just unbelievable, thank you Amazon. Sound quality is awesome, bass is too good, overall I am using it for gaming and audio recording of songs in my studio. Great stuff.sound quality is crystal clear, bass is dimentional quality, and yes 3.5mm jack is spring string covered with extra protection, just awesome.",5
125,Top Quality Product for this budget.,"The best headphone in 800 Rs , Bass is too good. Also build quality Is very good.

Pros:
1. Excellent Sound Quality
2. Excellent Bass
3. The wire of Head phone is very thick
4. Steel sprint at the end of the wire to protect it from breaking at end due to bending.
5. Moving and adjustable speakers which can be folder and carried easily.
6. The weight is also not very heavy.
7. Best in pricing.
8. Very good build quality.

Cons:
None from my side.

Very Happy using this product .",5
126,GOING GOOD AND STRONG,"actually a decent one for it's price. I got it last year around the months of September and October. It has traveled with me a lot and still works fine apart from the fact that there's a chirping sound sometimes. I am no professional by the way, I only like music and this thing right here has helped.",4
127,Go for Boat Rockers instead,"Doesn't feel tight. As for sound quality Noise leaks, does pretty decent job but I'd rather go for Boat rockers 400/450. They cost just Inr 200 more than this and does the job better twice. With just INR 200 it gives bluetooth, removable aux(that way if the wire is damaged it can be replaced), feels tight(in a good way).
The basshead feels little cheaper in packaging term too, the box of boat rockers 400 feels and looks pretty decent. Whereas basshead comes in very simple cheap style packacking.",3
128,Best product ever..!!,With such a grt and reasonable price I got the most finest product and the sound quality is just awesome and and the overall built quality is just amazing totally impressed with this product highly recommended to everyone who seek to listen song with better quality I have been using boat products from last 4-5 years and I still didn’t got any issues regarding this product I just love this company and there product quality I have purchased 3 different types of products of this company and I’m damn satisfied...best product for gift and for self use also❤️,5
129,Super value at this pricepoint,"Terrific value for money. These are perfect as your everyday headphone for youtube or general gaming. If you want to nitpick you will find that the sound is not crystal clear and a little bit muddy towards the lows, but when you look at the price you'll forget all of that!",5
130,Good. But loose on my head,"Packaging was good. Nice and compact. I received my order earlier than expected. Sound quality is really good for such a small budget. The wire is really long but springy, so sometimes it feels a bit curled up which can obstruct when typing. Only issue is that it is loose on my head. I have tried several overhead headphones and they all fit my head although some were a bit too tight, that was resolved by extending the overhead. But with this one, its already loose so I dont know how to make it sit on my head snugly without extending beyond my earlobes. Thats why the 4 star rating. :)",4
131,Best at budget,"I have now used it for one year. Great value for money product.

Sound: 10/10. The sound quality of this headphone is amazing and on par with many expensive ones. Bass is amazing, it feels very natural. Lows, highs, mids and vocals are perfectly balanced. It is great for playing games as well.

Durability: 10/10. The wire of the headphone is very thick and tangle free. I have dropped it a few times from my bed and there isn't any visible damage or scratches.

Comfort: 7.5/10. When continuously using for 3-4 hours you may feel a little pain on your ears because of the pads. But I think that's a general issue with budget headphones. Also you can't run around wearing these. It is quite uncomfortable to do so.

Mic: 6/10. The mic is actually below average. There is no noise cancellation. My mic sometimes doesn't even work(I have this issue for the past 2-3 months). However other headphones in this budget don't even offer a mic, and others which do have sh*t audio and build quality. So I think it's a restriction to these budget gadgets. You can't expect everything at this price.

Overall I feel if the mic doesn't really bother you, then just go for it. Otherwise invest some more money and get the basshead 450 or 510. Or you can wait for the big sales as they recieve a discount of 300 and 500 respectively.",5
132,Useless headset. With great repair and support by boat.,"Within 2 months of purchase the microphone has stopped working.

Update to previous comment, although microphone did fail however the level of support and the ease of simply sitting at home and getting it repaired was great. The headset was picked up by courier service and after repair or exchange a working headset was delivered back. Very very smooth experience with regular updates over mail and on the site. Only comment is I could not figure out whether a brand new or refurbished headset was sent as replacement.",1
133,"Decent buy. But very tight fit on ears, giving pain after a few minutes of use.","I liked the headphone for the following reasons:

1. Nice look and feel.
2. Good sound quality (4 🌟 stars).
3. Ease of use.

Was not happy for only two reasons.

1. There is a feeling of uncomfortableness on the ears when used for longer times.

2. It's quite tight on the ears and they start paining after 3 to 5 minutes of use, requiring to align the headphones again and again on the ears, or stop using it for a few minutes.",3
134,at this price its better than any other trust me,"i used sony mdr110(899) one,the jbl(950) and skullcandy jib(799) but those have issues , this one is crisp and sturdy than those products and sound is crispy.I keep the volumn at 35-40 and is sounds so loud and crispy clear,but at this price those headsets i needed to keep the sound level at 60-65 to get clear and loud sound. Boat is obviously better choice ..go get it.Those who wear glasses it is very comfortable for them too...",4
135,The Best headphone under 1000 with high bass,"Overall 4.8/5 Great Headphone at this price

Bass 5/5 You will definitely love it's BASS!

Comfort 3.5/5 It's loose but you will slightly feel pain in ear but good for this price

Build 4.3/5 Good build quality but if wire would be Braided then it would be better.

Portability 4.5/5 Easily foldable.

ALL OVERALL JUST GO FOR IT.",5
136,Try them once,"Just perfect in looks, sound quality, volume, noise cancellation and has a really deep bass.
Trust me on this and buy these boat headphones.
You have a 7 day replacement window so even if you dont like these headphones (which i doubt will happen) u can always return them. And if u like them and they stop working after like 4-5 months (which i also doubt would happen) you can always go to boat service centre and get them fixed for free.
Also did i mention these look really good and are really compact which makes it ideal for traveling?",5
137,3 Years Review (Great Headphones),"I'm using this headphone for a long time. And I wear these each and everyday during commute and while working.
Hands up the best one out in the market regarding the sound quality and build quality in this segemnt.
Pros:
1. Good amount of base for indian base lovers.
2. Clear sound.
3. Adequate treble.
4. Long cable for connecting to your phone. And this baby is tough. Wouldnt break easily. Believe me i took it to its limit.
5. Comfortable for 3 hours of continous listening.
6. Alliminium connector with spring threadded protection. It helps a lot in keeping the connector intact.
7. Long head band for large headed people. And quite comfy for this price segment.

Cons.
Not much to say since these does not affect the usage that much.
1. The spring threadding will rust after around a year only if you use continously like me, but it still wouldn't break. And just the spring would rust, not the other part.
2. The skin on the ear muffs would tear off a bit after a year. Only if used to its extent. I would recommend to just take out the ear muffs and then brush the skin off completely, it would give it a grewish colour and it works fine.
3. Sound is a bit muffled but its hard to be felt.
4. After 3 hours of continous usage the sweet spot just fades away. It hurts a bit. (Read the rest for a sollutuion)

I bought this headphone 3 years ago and it costed me then around 1200 INR. just yesterday the left side of the pivot limit broke, which means that the left side of the ear would rotate much more than it should rotate. But considering the price and its usable life im surprised. Fun fact: I intentionally broke the right pivot too, so that bot of them can rotate freely. and it made the headphone a lot better to wear ;) i can now wear it for longer than usual.",5
138,These instructions might help someone.,"NEVER EVER LET THE CUSHIONING PART TOUCH ANYTHING WHILE KEEPING IT ON STRETCHING, just turn the earcups, its okay if it rests onto the metal grill/net while stretching. (Follow the image)
Regarding the tightness of the headphone, ears getting hot and hurting ears, yes these issues exist but follow stretching shown in the image, it will be bearable after a while.
Regarding sound quality : One will never get expected sound quality unless they tweak equiliser to their individual taste, which is subjective.
I use Viper4Android and it blows my listening experience.
Materail quality is good.",4
139,Best for the Price,"For the price offered, the headphones are nice and sound good.
Pros
-Decent Black Color
-Flexibles

Cons
-If used long, you'll feel pain in Ears.
-Imbalance in Trebble & Bass.
-Not for Audiophiles
-Usual Design
Redline :- Good for the price these are available at and specially in discount sales.
Perfect fit for someone who need either something to start with or doesn't care much about the experience.",3
140,Do not buy this headphone,"I bought this headphone on 23rd January, 2021, and I am writing this review on the 15th of March, less than 2 months later. The headphone is of extremely low quality, and I find that even Amazon will not accept a return now, and there's no way to contact the company that sold me this worthless piece of junk. I wrote to the email address mentioned on the warranty card but it bounced back the next day, which means that it is invalid. That's nearly Rs.700 down the drain.",1
141,Best headphones ever seen and used,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This product is very good as expected so there is no no complaint about this and if there is any problem then I will update this item otherwise it is very nice if you want to go for a headphone then surely go for it without any problem you can all you can also buy white colour but it will get dirty due to oil in your hair so the carbon black colour is more study also it has a metal extender which you can use it for extending it and there is no problem in wearing it is very stretchable and light and we can also and we can also extend it as per our head so no problem I will be updated soon and it has metal finishing in the ear cups and the ear cups are 360 degree rotating thank you....... it is a good product at 799 rupees however you can get this also cheaper than this rate.....",5
142,Read once you may get benefited thanq u,"Hello guys ,I am reviewing this product after one year of use... According to me it is superb in this range and I have one request don't play songs on which you have stored in memory card of 320kbps or 128kbps u will feel very bad u won't get the effect of music and try to use gaana,Amazon prime ,
saavan.Spotifyy etc starting I also felt very sad but after listening to gaana den I understood...u can feel it ...and one thing I am using moto g4 plus mobile old one for this no problem and if ur mobile supports Dolby Atmos den u will feel the real bliss no doubt in that I have tested that with my cousin which supports Dolby Atmos which is awesome and I purchased this one on 22 aug 2019 till now no problem best in this budget for everyone this is my opinion maybe helpful for someone tq u",5
143,Good quality earphones..got replacement for mic issues,"The product is good overall. Sound quality is good. The only pbm is if you wear improperly, it will cause ear pain on long time usage of it. So set it in your ear properly. I used it for around 6-8 months from my data of purchase. Then faced some mic issues. So raised a ticket in boat heads warranty claiming site. Got the replacement product. Thanks for the excellent customer service - boat heads image marketing team.",4
144,One of the best at its price range.,"I bought this piece of headphone in Oct last year, and after using it for over a year, I can assure the future buyers to go for it without any hesitation. In last one year, I faced no issues and it's still running great.

Pros :
1. Great body build.
2. Great durability.
3. Great bass and crystal clear sound.
4. Wire is thick and durable for longer period.

Cons.
1 only thing I kinda feed not good about it that's it wire a bit longer, which makes it bulky and kinda hard to handle. But overall it's a great purchase.",5
145,"It'll get dirty over time, but worth the sound.","Excellent bass reproduction, Good quality audio, not suitable for the 'pure' music lovers. Bass is elevated by significant amount. I preferred black over white, but it was not available at that time for a reasonable price. 700-800 is reasonable for the product. White coloured device will change its colour to some sort of creame due to usage, of you are not extremely hygiene (Which is not for typical users). Band is slightly tight in the beginning but within a month or two usage, it will be more than comfortable kind of loose fit. Included mic is of slightly low gain, especially for whatsapp voice chats. I don't know whether it's a software thing or not, its fine for calls and all.",4
146,Great headphone for general use and audio calls.,"I believe these are great headphones under 1k that are available in the market.
I have used Philips headphone that was around the same price but in few days audio jack was separated from wire. However these Boat ones are sturdy.
Pros
1. They are strong and sturdy.
2. Excellent for audio calls and mike quality is good as well.
3. Ear pads are nice you can easily keep them on for 3-4 hrs.
4. Audio quality is good per the price range. You've to be practical enough to not compare the quality with the headphones that ranges from 5K and above.

Cons

1. Bass again it's not a deal breaker for me . If you are not looking for great bass it's for you. The bass is a bit low but they works.",5
147,"Nice sound, careful with the extra bass though!","Pros: Great build, comfortable on the ears, nice sound quality. Not sure if any sound cancellation was happening, I suppose that will be better tested during a flight or a commute.

Cons: the bass sounds a bit muddy, unclear, and this gets worse if you're already using something like Dolby Atmos or even an equaliser setting that increases the lower frequencies. When I listened to Santana's Samba Pa Ti using Sony or JBL earphones, the drums sounded tight, clear and distinct. Not so with these phones. My recommendation would be to turn off any sort of bass boosting software on your playback device, because these phones are designed to boost it anyway.",4
148,love this headpohn❤,"its a awesome product. the perfect sound quality and its sounds look like theator . i can say we even cant find this type of sound in cinema hall. its base is amazing .watching movie in mobile pohn is like watching in cinema hall. affordavle price . wire is long and metal pin, all things are very well. 5 out of 5 rating product , love it❤",5
149,Worth the price,This one is a good buy. Initially the headphones appear to be a bit tight to our ear slots. But after a month or so you will get used to its tight fit. Listening to music for long hours is not advisable. Make sure you are taking breaks in between. Bass quality is very good. Sound quality can be improved. Anyhow it is worth its price. Go for it...,4
150,Must have headphones for music lovers,"I was using ear buds for hearing and singing. Used to find the ear buds uncomfortable and would cause throat pain. Switched to boat headphones, found them to be comfortable and quality of sound was much better. The throat problem also improved.",5
151,Worth buying,"I bought this in Feb 2020, but toward the end of March I had to move and leave the headphones behind (covid) so I only really began using the headphones exactly a year later. In a month of using, the cloth of the earpiece began to tear slightly, and by June there were multiple tears. The music quality is unaffected and quite amazing for such a low cost. The headphones can be a bit painful after long wear, I normally can't wear it for more than an hour at a time, but perhaps it has something to do with my wearing spectacles. The cord is very long; I usually keep it tied up. Very much worth.",4
152,Review after 1 year,"It's been a year since I bought this , I've been using it for almost 7 hours a day for a year and it is like day 1 quality , the build quality is great , the chord didn't break , mic is nice , good for joggers , cushions don't tear up , chord is long , good for gaming , 4 stars for music , but for 700 rupees this is unbelievable and worth for money , I've used 5 headphones for 5 different companies and this is greater than those . It is little heavy , so if you want light weight you could also consider sony headphones",5
153,Nice pair of headphones,"Nice pair of headphones. Though my ears hurt after using them for too long... Might be a personal problem that many might not face. Sound quality is nice. Noise cancellation can be improved. Wire is strong and durable, have been using for the past few months and working absolutely well!",4
154,Not endurable,"I had this headphones 🎧 , but after 1 year it is not working anymore. So, quality is good but product isn't endurable for long time .may be it is because of my rough use . ,I don't know , but if you are going to buy this then take fully care of it . Don't wear headphones while sleeping . Don't pull wire of headphones too much . If you are confident that you will use it property with care , then it is worth buying and quality is also wonderful.",3
155,Good Headphone to start with,"The boat is now a very good brand, marketed in India. The sound quality is decent and I find it useful while doing casual gaming or listening to music. While watching movies or TV Series, the voice I find is not so crisp but still gets the work done in full volume. I do not listen to anything in 100% volumes as it increases the treble a lot. I rather prefer to keep my sound levels to 50-60% which is crisp and sharp.",3
156,Better for indoor usage and not suitable for travel.,"Good sound quality and decent bass

Pro's
1. Sound quality
2.bass

Cons
1. Sound leakage is very high, so not preferable for travel, sony MDR is fair better option in this price range.
2. Size wise also bit huge than expected.",3
157,Worth the money,"Definitely go for this one . I can assure u that u loved this headphone. Good quality, Sound quality is quite amazing, Have noise cancellation as well and superb bass too. I'm impressed . In this amount if u r getting a boat product then what else u want . Grab the deal . Tryna purchase it when sale is on so that u can save more . Cushion comfort on ears , very light weighted. I have order the same product again.",5
158,From apple earphones to boat,"I was handled black while i purchased white but amazon sort it out with ease
Now i received white after 2 days and while listening to music considering price
Pros
High bass specifically considering price range
Decen build quality

Cons:
As its little loud,full bass only come out when its on full volume so i used equaliser but it though made bass little muddy

Else its best i was using apple earphones got drained in water they are around 2k and these are just 800 and still they compete each other but mids and highs are little clear on apple so considering price i m amazed to buy these",5
159,Sublime Music experience at an affordable price,"It is very light which is very surprising because it gives a wonderful music experience. At this price, the noise cancellation is amazing. The bass surely does make you feel it's presence and the treble stabilization is also done masterfully to give you an overall serene experience. These pair of headphones would surprise you with their output quality as the small packaging does (I was a little scared at seeing how compactly it was packed). All over, at this price range I don't think any other headphone can beat the music experience this headphone provides.",4
160,Proper product details,"Day 1 of using this product : good design and looks, the 3.5 mm jack is normal, sound quality is good with good bass.
The headphones are somewhat tight on ears, I think with passage of time it will become loose so that is not big issue.
The ear cushions on earpiece is OK.
You cannot wear this headphones continuously for more than 1 or 1.5 hours because your ears will start paining because of tightness.
In terms of sound and bass it is good.
Let's see till what time it functions properly.

This was the 1st day use details of product.",3
161,Perfect for short term,"The snug fit model makes the headphones not to slip easily. The sound quality is good, and it has deep bass. As far as I used there is no sweat problem. It cannot be used for long hours continuously as it causes discomfort to ears. It will last for an year, and then the fabric gets peeled off which gives a old thorwable look, but still works perfectly fine in terms of sound.",4
162,"If have stock single pin with 3lines, let me know","Useless, where as I required 3 lines plug in were as I got double pin with 2lines,which is only support to sound system, not mobile phone. I want single pin with 3lines which has to connect proper to cell, n even sound is also very much lowered, very bad experience",1
163,Good for the price!,"Got it as a gift for my dad who does rough use of gadgets, it is compact, durable and the jack has a spring that prevents breakage or wires popping out. Ignore the negative reviews and buy it if you are interested in wired headphones. Also, the mic is like the one we have for wired earphones but works really well and is ergonomic!
I got it at a good deal and lovin it!",5
164,Poor or bad design,"Pros:
Sound quality is really good.
Material quality is good.

Cons:
Poor or bad design, you can tilt and twist the speakers because of its design.
So, one of the speaker got detached from the headset.
Now, we cannot use it though it works properly.
Not so durable, because of bad design.",3
165,good headphones for the price range,"good headphones with suitable amount of bass but the bass gets in thye way of the vocals qand lows as expexted in this price range
tips whle buying
""better to buy black rather than white due to dirt issues
""very noticeable sound leak at 100% and 75% VOLUME
when traveling in quite buses and planes the personb next to you can hear the vocals
if sound leak is an issue it is better to go for earphones
bass is really good and it sure is a good headphones for a beginner dipping shoes into the audiophile world",4
166,Very good quality.,This is an awesome product. Very good sound quality. Value for money. Good looking and easy to use and carry. Wire is also protected by metal spring so that this will not dammaged on the curve. Bass is also good but it should be more than this.,4
167,Exceptional sound and build quality for a low price,"The sound quality of these headphones is amazing! Didn't expect such a good quality at this price. Hats off to Boat for this amazing product.
The bass is decent enough, good for gaming. Surround sound is not an issue for this one, handles it easily and maintains voice clarity at all times.
The mic is a little low on volume when on call and the other person might not hear loud enough but that's not a major concern if you speak a bit louder or bring the mic closer to mouth.
A 5/5 product for sure in terms of build quality, have been using it since a month and not disappointed so far.",5
168,Great product to buy,Again another great boat product for its price. Bass could be better (if you are looking more for that). But over great music output. Build quality could be more better I guess looks a bit fragile (like it might crack if dropped from a height or something) But I have had no complaints from boat so far😄😄😄.,4
169,Worthy Purchase,"I purchased it for playing PUBG and I am not at all disappointed.

Wearing these I can even hear the sound of other players crawling in ground.

Give significant advantage because footsteps can be heard clearly, giving an idea of direction of enemies.

Good purchase.",5
170,"headphone is pretty good with good quality sound, noise cancellation and also bass is good.","the headphone is pretty good with good quality sound, noise cancellation and also bass is good.

Just small issue is that it is very tight to the ear as it is brand new. Cannot use headphone for long amount of time in one go.
Need to keep it strectched so that it becomes a bit loose",4
171,Good headphone,"Initially I got a defective product but I must be appreciate the way AMAZON respond and immediate exchange the product and got a good one. Headphone is light weight, good bass quality , best cable quality and 3.5 jack have special protection. So in all item is good. Must buy product.",5
172,"Lighter than other headphones, good volume and clarity.","Bought this for videoconference. Construction is good. Sound clarity is good. Mic sensitivity is good and has good shielding, so no hum pickup. No hearing fatigue or aching ear lobes after several hours of continuous use.Folds into a nice flat profile - ideal for keeping it on top of the PC.",5
173,Enjoy music and calls,"Good headphones with integrated Mike on the left speaker wire. I have tested it on phone and laptop. Works fine for calls. During the calls, sound is loud without noise. While listening to music it gives good all round performance. The bass is quite good for this price range. I can say it is better than my old JBL headphones. If u want headphone with mike only for calls then there are other cheaper options. But if u want for both music and calls then blindly go for this one.",5
174,The best since 2years(user),This is the best headphones and the bass is so osm and i was using this headphones since past 2years and there is no problem and i brought another one and the previous one is still working and there is no change in the quality of sound and we get the original bass believe me the bass quality is soo osm and mids and high's are also pretty good. Definitely i recommend this product to those who want the best wire headphones.,5
175,Product started malfunctioning in 7 months,"The warranty service provided by BOAT is worst. I have been trying to contact them since last one month. But no one picking up the call. I have even registered my complaint through the website, but got no response. so if u r purchasing this product keep one thing in mind: Once the product starts malfunctioning u will be unable to replace the defected product. LOHE KE CHANE CHABANE PAD JAYENGE. But one thing must be appreciated sound quality and comfortability is this product is good. But their customer service is worst.",3
176,Never buy these headphones,"I brought the headphones for the first time and I am really unhappy with the product. Volume is coming out of the headphones when you listen to songs or talk to someone on the phone 😠, secondly you can't wear it for more than 1 hour since your ears will start paining and by that time you can feel your ears are already so hot and there is no sweat protect.",1
177,Clamping force is too much causing pain.,You can get better sound from realme buds 2 ear phones which costs just Rs.599.,1
178,Stopped working in less than 2 months,The headphones stopped working in less than 2 months of usage - the right side speaker doesn't work any more. I've sent a couple of emails to the warranty email id that's provided on the website with no response. I'd have expected a better product and response from a brand like boat.,1
179,Doesn't work for long.,Boat is a useless company. I bought earphones first with in one month defect came. Only one ear would work. Then my husband bought headphones. Same thing only one month and one ear of headphone not working. BOAT IS UTTER USELESS.,2
180,Good one,"The person I gifted this absolutely loved it. She has been using it for the past 2 years without any complaint. The only downside is that now after prolonged use, the covering on the earpiece is peeling off.",5
181,Got a Defective or Used Product,"I received a Defective or Used product, the cushioning of the left ear on the Headphone is quite loose and has 2-3 scrathes, either it seems as a manufacturing defect or the product has been used before...

It's just that, I'm in dire need of Headphones due to my Coaching classes & cannot afford to loose any further time, so I'm not returning them, otherwise I would have returned them immediately....

it's like Amazon doesn't even care for the quality of the products it sells and takes advantage of the customers situation, especially at such times....it's very Sad & Disheartening....😞😞",1
182,Good headphones with better price with mic,"Hi guys just loot it

**************Thank you******************
Amazon",5
183,Awesome sound. Normal bass.,"Awesome sound quality best I have heard out of 20 earphones/headphones I have. Bass is normal definitely not for bass heads. Misleading branding.
I am not a bass head so it's extremely enjoyable for me. But if bass was on little heavier side this would be #1 in all headphones.",5
184,Great Headphones with Great price,"So I purchased this headphone solely for light gaming as my Laptop isn't supporting Galaxy buds very well.

Coming to the review I found this headphone bang for the bucks. I got this for 800 INR

Pros:-
1) Excellent fit. When it comes to headphones I've always felt lack of punchy bass sounds due to their fit but I've no complaints from this headphone

2) Audio Jack quality is superb and it comes with pre installed spring at the end of jack to prevent the wire cut

Cons:-
1) Some people may not like it's tight fit. Especially people using glasses.

2) Sound quality is Normal don't expect exceptional surround sound from a 800 INR headphones (Also I'm pointing this after using Galaxy Buds and galaxy buds has great sound quality, so for normal user thi may not be a con)",5
185,Manufacturing defect,I bought this headphone on 4 Oct 2020. This product was very good so far. Suddenly the sound is not clear since last week and today I could not hear any sound when connected to my Laptop or Mobile devices. To my shock I found that the cable is damaged within a span of 3.5 months. The advertisement for this product was misleading and this product carried an year warranty. There is no option available in Amazon to return this product within the warranty period. Hence I am posting this review to benefit from not going for this product.,1
186,Product comfort,"This product is good but it has three problems
1) i took this for gaming this doesn't give accurate footsteps or shooting angles in (pubg)
2) this product is not comfortable to wear for hours .i used it continuesly for 1 hr my ears started paining 🥺
3)this product didn't cover my ears perfectly i can hear surrounding sounds

These problems i didn't expect from boat
And most importantly i prefer boat as my earphones or headphones i was disappointed with this product but still it deserves for music",3
187,Average product,"Within 3 months of use, it got defects. Claimed the guarantee and defective one was replaced by other (used one though the service center claimed it as new one). Requested the service center to repair my headphones as the replacement was not appearing new. But the center, didn't agree and gave me old one claiming as new replacement.
The replacement also got defects within 10-15 days. Service center is about 30 km from my residence. It's not practical to go there again and again.
Very poor experience.",2
188,Good for kids,I liked the headset a lot. Sound quality and material is good. Only downside is the over the ear coverage. Earlier i was using sony headset and its over the ear coverage is good. In comparison boat headset feels okay . it is smaller in comparison and hence feels good for usage by a kid onky. If u are an adult go for a higher range for better sound quality. Also there is no nois cancellatikn so anything u hear while hearing this headset wil be audible to ppl next to you.,4
189,One side of headphones are not working,"after 7-8 months of use the left side of headphones stopped working
within warranty
after i checking what's wrong
the wire that was going inside to the left part was BROKEN
after contacting the service center they said that we can do nothing
please help me
and Amazon does not show option to return or replace it within warranty period.",1
190,Sound Quality,"Made for Bass Lovers..
Good Headphone at this price point..
Sound quality is so good with a louder Bass..
Built Quality and finishing is nice..
Best Budget headphone..
Ear cups are comfortable..
But little bit sound came outside of headphone.. anyone can hear it if focused.
Should We Buy ...
If it is on an offer or Price in range 600~750 yes you should buy...",5
191,Best in class headphones,"The sound quality and the comfortness of this over the head earphones is awesome..
The low price adds to the product awesomeness..
Disliked the noise cancellation of mic, as recording or voice calling is little difficult in wfh scenario where there are uncontrollable outside noise..

Overall best in class product, and surely recommend to anyone who wants voice calling and comfortable overhead earphones ..

One thing last, for pc users who don't have Mobo supporting both mic and audio feature in one jack need to buy splitter",4
192,Not good for music lovers,"Not sure why people voted 4 star average. There is nothing great or up to mark in this headset.

1. Sound leak
2. Too much of distortion at high levl volume
3. Lows are pretty poor, high and mids are not up to mark
4. Aucostics are totally out of balance",2
193,good...,"The headphone quality and sound quality was very good. The only problem was the headphone jack wore out after little use (probably a manufacturing defect) so I used their warranty service, even though i had seen many negative reviews about boat's warranty service, it was all well and good for me. They picked it up on 23 Nov and compensated it with a new product on 06 Dec, hats off to boat for the warranty service!!!",4
194,Main cons of this product,"GIVING YOU MAIN CONS OF THIS HEADPHONE
1• If you are wearing for a longer time, it gonna hurt your outer ear very badly.
2• If you are on call , other person will hear a tik tik sound from your side.
3• Whether on a call or in a multiplayer online game with voice chat, the bass of other person is so high that you don't understand that he/she says.",2
195,Non Existent Service,"The heads phones worked for three months and have stopped working since. Have been trying to contact the Boat service centre in Chennai but the number provided is switched off. All the warranty and promises of services seem to be bogus. The Boat website claims to allow one to raise a complaint but in reality simply gives the same service centre number !!
Losing faith in Boat as a brand after such a poor experience.",1
196,Best in budget,"This just the best wired headphones under 1000 bucks...
Just give it a try..
I dont have any issue with it, and its sound and bass just amazing....
And the best part i got it only for 599....",5
197,First Impressions- Good (Quality and Sound wise),"GENUINE REVIEW:----------

Just Got it... Received today.
----------------------------------------
Bass was SuperB. I am using Snapdragon Audio+ and Bass was outstanding on mobiles 🤩 BUT Laptop Output had Low Bass 😞. But the Punches and Thump i felt from the pads when playing music on mobile was great.
----------------------------------------
Pads are really soft and comfortable on the ears..
Wire Quality is Good and soft as well.

No Inner Ear pain.. I used it for 1 hour continuously, but the auricle of the ear was paining because of tight grip it gets on your head after 1 hour. 😖Loose it by stretching it up on the book.
----------------------------------------
And Lastly Jack is well built with springs on the end for long lasting.

VERDICT:- 4/5😌

-1 Because of Auricle Pain 😖",4
198,Perfect as always,"Perfect bass , no ear pain at all perfect for gaming as well as the sound quality on ps4 is quit amazing . I specially bought it to watch movies and play little game on PS4 and boat never fails . My fav. Brand of all",5
199,Worth it.,"1) The built quality - 4.5/5
The built qualitywas really good even though the most of it was made with plastic. The steel was used when we extend the headphones.
2) The sound quality- 4.5/5
The bass was really awesome (as expected)
3) Noise cancellation- 2/5
The nose cancellation is not that good, but you can adjust by increasing volume.

Overall- I highly recommend to buy these headphones as the product is worthy as you get awesome sound quality at lower price (I bought when the price was Rs.699)",4
200,Never buy unless until sm1 gave it free....,One ear is not working after 4 months....A lot of issue occurre when connected to the mobile after plug in can't connect to hai audio jack sound still came from the main speaker.... After re starting the phone headphone connected....And it's occures with every phone I have....So there is prblm with the headphone..... Build quality is poor for this price range.....Just after 2 month it's broken ...I have to fixed it with feavyquick.....Never buy this product.....,1
201,Good product awesome sound,"Very well packed received the next day of order ,its two days past using it since working fine till now. It's the first headphone I have bought which is above 200 usually I go for cheap earphones to save cost ,hope this investment turns beneficial for longer time.
With Edit after weeks to this review, I started facing a problem ear pains after using for little time as basically the ear cup is round and not oval, there is no sound issue but design issue as everyone ears are oval.
And now cannot return also as the return date as passed in the experimentation phase.",4
202,"Best in this range, review after usage of almost 2 years","I bought these headphones back in June 2019. And I must say I didn't expect this much at this price.

First of all, the headphones look retro, this is what I like a lot.

Sound quality is AMAZING, again, AMAZING. The mids, highs are all amazingly balanced. The bass is not too overpowering to destroy the vocals. it's just perfect. Now it's been almost 2 years, the earcups are wearing out, but the headphones still sound great. They're very durable. After 1.5 years of use, I'm starting to hear some creaking noises, but it's fine. The jack is amazing too, has a spring so the wire does break there. It's not gold plated, but in real life usage, it doesn't make any big difference. The PVC material cable is tangle free. Everything is good. Just one problem: Comfort

Now don't get me wrong. You can use these for an hour, but after that it may start hurting your ears. just put them in your neck for 2 minutes, then wear again.

Mine haven't broken yet and are still working, but I they break I'll buy them again.

Sound quality: 5/5
Bass quality: 5/5
Durability: 5/5
Comfort: 4/5",5
203,Everything was fine until I heard a static sound in the background,"I bought it and was so very happy with the look until I heard a static sound in the background of my zoom meeting which hurt my head so much. So I tested it with some songs and I heard the static sound but it was much lower with the songs. I tested this case again with my old headphone (which doesn't have cushion in the surface, it got torn) and the sound was perfect, no static sound or whatsoever. I'm glad this sound didnt start coming later when I couldn't return the product ( its just 16 hrs since I got the product ) from now on I wont be buying *any* electrical products from Amazon. thank you😠",2
204,More than a Quality Product for Rs.599,"It's foldable, nice cusioning, extra bass boosted headset as mentioned, I bought this for 600Rs. This is the best headset, better than Motorola, one button play and pause, and double click for the next song.
If it's Rs749, jus add to the cart and wait for the opportunity...
I think this offer is being given once every two month...",5
205,Cool and superb product in that price range 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,"Superb product in this range go for it, if u want nicely built headphone with great sound and bass quality and also the built quality is superb if u want wired headphones go for it guys 🙏🙏
The only problem I faced with this headphones is the voice goes out little but no problems challenges are everywhere

Although very great at that cheap price and thanks amazon and boat 🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰😍😍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",5
206,This is not working within a year,"This product is not working, within a year, it is broken, sound is not coming at all. I kindly request Amazon to help me get a replacement to refund. I am very much disappointed. I bought so many boat headphones, all giving high price. But all of them are broken, sound is not coming. I should have bought some other company which was cheaper as this is not worth at all",1
207,BEAST HEADPHONES...,These headphones was very good i fallen in love these headphones have very good sound quality n bass quality.... And i got for only ₹599. That was a verry cheap price n good product. That was less than 10$... Build quality was also good.. wire quality was alsooo good... Microphone was an alsoo good... Packaging was also..... i get delivered within 16 hours.... and its 3.5 mm jack was the beast.... And it was very compact n light weight. Thanks Boat.. for this product...,5
208,Very Flimsy Headphones,"I bought 3 of them for my family. Two of them broke within 2 months of usage. The build quality is very poor and some flimsy parts are there in the headphones which break very easily.

Sound quality is good though.",5
209,"Mic stopped working within a month, no customer support",We purchased from amazon and within a month its mic has stopped working. When we contacted amazon they gave us Boat customer care number. When we call customer care we get a list of authorized service centers. On calling the center they ask to visit the store. Just imagine the harassment customer is going through. My nearest service center is 7kms away and I have no intention to visit it during rising Covid cases in Mumbai. AVOID any BOAT products,1
210,Very uncomfortable,"Just okay product in this price range. Bought it under offer for Rs. 600. Some pointers from me are:
a) I like bass but bass in these headphones sound unnatural to me.
b) Not meant for long term hearing. Very uncomfortable bass and also heats up the ear.
c) I cannot comfortably put these on for more than 15 mins.",3
211,Best Headphones under 1000 Rs,"Boat Basshead 900, which i got in 800rs. Awesome Headphone with great base and fabulous Sound quality. good length of wire.Easy to Handle and Very light weight.You can easily make youtube videos it cancels most of the noises and reduces too much of background noises.Just Go for it if you have Budget under 1000. but if you budget around 1500rs then go for boat Rockerzz....🔥🔥",4
212,Excellent product for the price range,"Excellent product for the price range. I am using boat product over some time and I am satisfied with its quality.
First of all the sound quality is awesome and has good bass and voice clarity.
The noise cancellation is good but not the best in market.
The build quality is awesome and it is built like a tank, especially the jack and wire. Hope it will last for many years to come.",5
213,Overall a good option compair to other brands in this price range.,"Sound quality is good in this price point, but everyone arround you can hear, what you are listening.
And something is wrong with the fitting/design, I couldn't identify yet. my right ear started paining after 2hrs use.

Rest build quality seems good, overall a good option compair to other brands in this price range.",3
214,For Middle class gamers,"Iam writing this review after 4 months of use.i ordered it on january great indian sale at 650/-.So it was a great deal.
When coming to headset its just awsome for bass anf sound.The problem is with mic its just emits echo to receiver out there.But it ise not much problem for me bucause it is very little as it doesn't have a noise cancellation mic.
As it is an ON-EAR headphone it will pain of u keep it for 3-4 hrs.But it is only initial for 1month.
And it is a great headphone when comes to PUBG i assure that if u r looking for a budget buy for all purposes headphones then it suits best for u as it did for mine.
From four months i don't see a single con except for that mic echo but it will also come when u r near wind.
Overall it was a great buy for me and if u r a middle class teen like me then u can buy this with no doubt..
I think u found this helpful..😀😊",5
215,Utter nonsense,"After using JBL tempo for over 4years , I thought of switching to boat because of so many positive reviews but I am very disappointed to say the least, it has failed to surpass my expectations. Returning the product. The worst part of this product is while listening to it everything can be heard by any person standing next to it, then what's the point of buying an headphone.",1
216,Never buy this headphone it is totally best of money and also customer care does not respond,One thing which I like most in this headphone is that it its sound quality is good but it coming to noise cancellation it is the worst product which I have ever used. The most dissatisfying thing is that the left side of of the headphone stopped working. I have purchased this product on 7th October and I am writing review on 5th of November actually I would have given 0 stars rating if it ware possible I am going to consumer court to deal with this problem because I have the warranty card of this product which will expire on 7th of October 2021 that's all from my side thank you,1
217,Superb,"It's a superb headset at the rate
It blows your head the bass is powerfull
It's one of the best product from boat
Edit: I've use this for one year and I love it
Pros: powerfullbass,superb noise cancellation for the Mike ,passive noise canxellation for audio 80%responding to low frequencies the 40mm neodiyum drivers are doing their best,I've played songs from different phones using this headphone and they vary
From different audio processors in phone 🖤ed the product
Cons: the wire sucks it's too thick and it rotates on the Mick portion and the wire inside twists and it stopped playing after my warranty period but repaired em",5
218,Kills your ears.,"Very inappropriate design. They are too small to cover your ears. This makes your ears hurt after using them for barely around 5 minutes. The sound is good but the cons in design outweigh that. Also, not sure, but I think the sound is such that it gives you an earache even on listening to a single song. I've never experienced that with other earphones. I would avoid this product.",1
219,Very nice,Very nice piece at highly reasonable price. Amazing sound quality and clarity. Very light weight but comfortably surrounds the ears and stays well over the head. Specially liked two very thoughtful things- one sided cable for comfortable wear and a spring protection at the audio jack for kink protection. The metal grip provide at the audio jack also gives it a promise of durability.,5
220,Good product but packaging should be improved,Everything was on point. The headphone itself was as expected i.e. good. But the packaging was not at all good it was sent withoutany proper packaging like you would expect for a product from Amazon. It just had the box with with the bill attached to it and also the box was a but crushed not in proper shape that you may have second thoughts about it being used earlier. But about the headphone I am satisfied with the performance so far. The bass quality is super good actually you can say it has too much bass.,4
221,best one,The best headphone in Rs. 700. It's made in India and awesome build quality. Bass is awesome n this price and also very comfortable.,5
222,Quite Good at this price range. but disappointed after a while of using this product,"(When I purchased.)

Just go for this. You won't regret buying such a beautiful product at this price range. Don't listen to any negative comments here they vary from people to people according to their personal experience but overall it's a good deal. Grab it!!

(Months later)

After using this headphone for months, now I have finally started to see its true color. At the very first sight when you purchase this , you get everything work smoothly like butter but a few months later the wire gets damaged torn, streched and its elements from inside pop out without a reason. In such headphones the quality of wire is extremely poor that you do not want to talk about. I need to cover them with tapes like iam a doctor covering wounds with stitches.
so I can not experience air disturbing the sound.

Fooled by you BoAt!!!!!

Good luck.",3
223,BEST IN BUDGET but a few drawbacks,"Good headphones overall for this price best choice
BOUGHT IF FOR 599 INR
writting review after 1 day usage
had used many boat products before

#PROS:--
*sound quality is best in this price range (5/5)
highs are very crisp , mids are clear, but lows are
almost killed due to addition of extra bass.
*build quality is descent nothing too special or
fancy , specially it is light weight still feels solid
*3.5 mm Jack is made up of metal and comes with a
spring and spring prevents it from breaking wire in
long term rough use
*padding is ok can wear it for 1 to 1.5 hrs after that
ears starts to pain.

# major CONS :--
* THE VERY SERIOUS ISSUE IS THAT WHEN U PLAY
MUSIC THE SOUND LEAKS OUTSIDE
i mean if very less sound is leaked then its ok but it
is extremlu loud even it can be annoying to u as
anyone sitting beside you can hear what r u
listening . for refrence u can take u r playing musuc
with your phone at volume at 2 level with ur
phone's speaker than the sound u hear is as same
as the sound leaked from headphones.

*as they are on ear headphones they r not too
comfortable specially for long time of continuous
use . So if uh spend more than 2 hrs. continuously
then better add some more money and get over
ear headphones

# minor CONS :--
*3.5 mm Jack is not gold plated
*no bearded or kevelar cable like usb cable and aux
cable made by boat, its just plastic with ok quality
*the microphone button is very tight/hard to press
and requires a bit of extra force which is annoying
*their is no seal on box (this is not only my case )for
this headphones u never get seal on box . Common
boat wtf is this its just a piece of tape .
*if u wear galsses then u should have to remove
them as the frame of glasses sits behing ur ear and
the headphones apply inward pressure on ur ear so
ur ear may start to pain due to glasses

I HOPE IN NEST VERSON OF PRODUCT BOAT WILL FOX THEASE ISSUES

And a request to amazon that the headphones took me 5 days to reach me plz dont take more than 2 days delivery time its very BAD",4
224,Genuine Review🔥🔥🔥1 year of use,"First of all the package 📦 was good...it contain headphone and manual and warranty card...
Sound quality and bass quality was excellent...notice cancellation is good 👍🏻
It’s good for gaming 🕹 but by a couple of hours it’s getting pain to the ears 👂...I felt hard pain...get away from water 💧 it’s not resistant...while getting water in it the cover is dropped you can see the image...so that it looks bad...
No other issue good at this price range🤘🏻🤘🏻🤘🏻
I think the modern world 🌎 you need to choose a Bluetooth device is better🔥",4
225,Sturdy Build With Average Sound Quality,"The build is very sturdy, the wire, the pin and headphone itself are very well built.

226,Received Damage Product on the first time - Right Speaker Not working,"Requested a replacement and once get and if the same working, perfectly, then will update my review, For the time being, - look wise good, but require to be checked properly when you received, : switch off and on the speakers left/right to check the same in detail.",2
227,Very Bad,"Honest Review - Though they claim super bass, it's actually not. The sound clarity, volume, treble are very poor. The only advantage is they are foldable and have mic function. Rest waste of money.",1
228,BEFORE U BUY PLZ READ THIS,"-->PROS:
1.EXCELLENT SOUND CLARITY AND BASS.
2.AT 100% SOUND BASS IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED AND STUNNING QUALITY.
3.ALL MY PREVIOUS HEADSETS WORE OUT AT CONNECTOR WHICH CONNECTS 3.5MM JACK TO MOBILE OR PC,BUT THIS ONE COMES WITH METALLIC SPRING LIKE PROTECTOR (AT JOINT)WHICH PREVENTS WIRE BENDING AND WEAR AND TEAR.
4.AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS SO SMALL FOR MY HEAD ,BUT LATER DISCOVERED ITS HEIGHT IS ADJUSTABLE(LAME ME) AND ITS FOLD-ABLE AND PORTABLE TOO.
5.COMES WITH ONE YEAR MANUFACTURER WARRANTY FROM BOAT.
-->CONS:
1.ITS QUITE (ALMOST) VERY TIGHT AND SQUEEZING MY EARS EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THIS ,HOPE IT WILL BECOME LOOSE IN FUTURE, IT MAKES ME STRESSED AND NOT ABLE TO WEAR MORE THAN AN HOUR SINCE NO AIR FLOW AND COMPLETELY DUMPS AIRFLOW.
2.AT SOME INSTANCES I FEEL IT VERY HEAVY TO WEAR AND CAUSE ME LOWER EAR PAIN.
3.NO VOLUME ADJUST BUTTON OR WHEEL,HAS ONLY ONE BUTTON TO ATTEND CALLS .
4.AT 100% VOLUME BASS MAKES HEADPHONES TO VIBRATE ,CAUSING ABOUT 1-3 % DISTORSION IN MUSIC(NOT VERY NOTICABLE IN ALL SONGS ONLY FEW EXCEPTIONS).",4
229,Excellent design and performance,The sound quality is great. The sensitivity and frequency response is excellent. The folding design makes it very compact indeed. The spring behind the metal connector seems to ensure against damage of the cable behind the jack. The padding is blocking out external noise well. The microphone on the cable is good.,5
230,It's been more than 1 year...,"I purchased it 1 year ago andas you all know now in lockdown I was bored so I'm writing this review to help the buyers...
Prons
Good sound quality
Stylish

Cons
Mic got damaged
Person sitting beside you can listen the sound from headphones

Sound quality Good
Noise cancellation Not so good
Bass quality Perfect",4
231,Probably one of the worst headphones in the market,"Probably the worst I got from boat.
The microphone cracks, the left ear cup cracks every now and then.
The volume gets automatically, which is extremely irritating when in an important meeting.
The cups are so tight on ears, they start paining after 10/15 minutes.

Please don't buy, past experience from boat was amazing but this downright sucks.

I wanted to have a replacement but alas I lost my warranty card.
Extremely disappointed.",1
232,Good product. Value for money. Bought for ₹699,"Pros.:
Good sound quality.
Bass is OK
Vocals are clear even at higher volume.
Cable is strong and long

Cons:
Earcups are not very comfortable.
I have doubt about its durability.

Overall product is good. But if you want to use it for longer time then handle carefully means don't fold earcups unnecessarily otherwise internal cable should be damage.",4
233,Great in-ear headset with Mic,"I was worried that in-ear headeset might hurt my ears , but I have used it for one hour continuously, and it didn't hurt at all. Good sound quality, good noise cancellation, mic is also good, no one complained about my audio quality in a conf call.",5
234,"Best for music, binge watching and GAMING","I used these headphones for almost 1.5 to 2 years after my little sister broke them🤦🏻‍♂️😂.
These headphones are just perfect.
I bought them just for 500...and they are worth more than the money....
Even in gaming they are far far better than the boat bluetooth headphones...
And the music quality is just perfectly fine.
Expecting more wired headphones from Boat",5
235,Built to last,"I bought this product in 2018 and im writing this review in 2021 i used this product 3 yrs and still now there is no problem with sound but some issues in its cusions it appears after 2 yrs its coating is gine completely but no problems with sound
And it is very easy to handle it can fold and it. Is super light weight

Sound quality :- 5/5
Bass :- 5/5
Design 4.5/5
Built quality :-5/5
Mic 4/5
Overall :- 4.5/5",4
236,Best on this price,"Best headphone (wired) under 1000 ruppee.
Just noise cancellation is average but no problem.

If u wanna to buy a headphone under 1000 just close ur eyes and go for it.

And also some review are negative this might be because the got a defective product.",5
237,heavy metall....,"It has got a good sound quality
also the voice is high.
It is good for ears if we use by lower volume.
It has got heavy Bass.That gives a gd feel for music and gaming.U will get the real feeling of gaming.Only thing is that i dont fee lany noise cancellation and i am not bothering about it and i just needed to give a right review thays why i had mentioned it.It is very much flexible and also foldable. we can make it very small.Its giving no pain to ears even after 2-3hrs use.
Giving gd comfort
Overall very niz product....",5
238,Good but manufacturing defect,"Headphones are good. Stylish and cool but maybe it has some manufacturing defect sound is not clear it does kirr sometimes in middle
The item has the manufacturing defect but when I returned it Amazon is saying that I returned them wrong product & did not initiated my refund such a fraudsters 😡😡",2
239,Fantabulous product😍,"As the delivery executive handed me the package , i was like ...what??
This is not what i've ordered!!!
Bcz the box inside the packing seems so smaal that i thought i have got a wrong product .
And i was curious as well as worried to see what i have got inside the packing but as i opened the amazons plastic packing ....boom!!
I was glad to see that i've got the right product which i have ordered ,The Boat Bassheads 900 ""the bass beast of this range"".
This product is just amazing and the sound is clear on full volume and the bass is lit💥💥infact when i play music on full volume the earcups are a bit shaking n i can feel it in my ears n yesss ...the box was small because the headphones are foldable and becomes much compact to be carried around while travelling, n the build quality is also great!
Thank you Amazon and Thank you Boat.❤️",5
240,Manufacturing Not Reliable,Boat products are not good. This was the second product I bought and prior to this I purcased a Boat stone 1000. Both got spoiled after warranty period of one year. Also the service center is not easily contactable and helpful. Though the sound quality is good but reliability and longevity is not at all satisfactory.,3
241,worst customer service from BOAT,"I purchased this product in January 2019 with 1 yr. warranty, but the product is not working so I have contacted the amazon customer care, they said that I have to talk to Boat c. care, so I have tried to contact them, they have worst customer care service, that neither CC officer receive calls nor the online complaint register form got uploaded. I have worst experience with Boat customer care service. Althogh Boat has their service centre in Kolkata(MAHAVEER DUGAR # LALANI INFOTECH LTD, 1A, KHETRA DAS LANE, 3RD FLOOR, KOLKATA- 700012) but they have no service for such product.",1
242,"Don't buy before reading it, I made it short","The amount of bass is too much it affects the sound quality, it's ok at first for 2-3 min but after extra bass starts to irritate too much it affects on listening, the quality of sound is too cheap and low it produces lot of noise which starts to inner ear pain, after using for 30min my ear started to hurt and pain due to the noise , also microphone is too cheap it doesn't capture audio if you're talking soft, to record the audio u gotta shout the hell out of it, for this prise range I'll give 2.5/5
Plus subscribe to my channel iceman1000",3
243,Waste of money!,"Bought it in Jan. All was fine. Suddenly, the mic stopped working.
Customer care number says invalid. Local retailer shut.
Email support non-existent.

Got a replacement and that too broke down. Same mic issue.

Total waste of money.",1
244,Problems with audio balancing.,The left-right audio balance is off. There's more volume in the left side. This makes it awkward to listen to music as it feels like you're going dear on your right. Could be improved by fixing this issue.,3
245,"Many positives, few negative","What is more than enough:
Sound quality,
bass,
clarity,
Comfortable

What is not good
- air caps teared after few months of normal use
- few times mic voice wasn't that audiable to other side during meeting",3
246,Review after 2 years. Comfortable one.,I am giving you the review *boat bass head phone 90 on ear*after using continuously for more than 2 years. It's really worth the cost of rs. 900. It came well without any problem. If u want extent after 2 years it's in ur handling the head phone. Sound quality and bass quality it's really good for the price. I didn't tried noise cancellation but everything else as mentioned in the product provides u the best one.,5
247,Don't expect it to last more than a year in normal use,"I purchased the item in March 2020, and I must say I am lukewarm with it. It stopped working in August, and had to be sent for repairs, the company took more than 1 month to ship it , repair it and then send it back. In March this year, the ears skins begin to come off. I would want an item to last longer perphaps.",3
248,Awesome Sound Quality But Very Uncomfortable,Sound quality was awesome. However I don't recommend it because after a few minutes of playing music your outer ear feels like burning and it becomes extremely difficult to put on these headphones any longer. People who watch series while lying down shouldn't buy it because you will not be able to lie on your side. Those who wear SPECTACLES please DON'T BUY these headphones. My experience was horrific to the extent that I started to hate playing music.,2
249,Boat can beat everyone.,"Superb device. Great sound and bass quality. Built quality great. In comparison,Boat can easily beat Sony.PVC cable was too much good and the length of the cable is really respectable.The 3d sound quality is so amazing. Microphone work well. The best budget wired Headphone.

Thanks boat and Amazon also.",5
250,Not Impressed!! Pricy for a basic package,"I am not very impressed with the headphones. Its average in avery aspect. Not that it wont do the work but nothing stands out.
I expected more when spending Rs700-800, better, dig a bit deeper in once pocket and go for seinheisser, sony etc",3
251,Worth it........!!!!,"One of the best headphones/earphones ever used.....
For all those who are saying its too small, they should know that this headphone can be adjusted as per your head size.....
I'm using it since March and i haven't seen any problem with the headphone
I recommend this headphone to everyone👍",5
252,Product Review,"I’ve bought this headphones for 700 bucks and should appreciate the quality of the product.
The bass quality is premium at this price range.
I’d definitely recommend this product in case you are looking to purchase something below 1000 bucks.
However this review is totally based on my day one experience of the product. The durability depends on our maintenance and also the manufacturing quality of the product.

Thanks Amazon for the safe delivery of the product.",5
253,A yearlong experience and...,"It's been a year using this headphone and it still works lije it just in the beginning. Build quality is great and can be said the same for wire. Many incidents have happened in the past which could have damaged the wire but it took it all. Microphone is also good. Noise cancellation is up to the mark. You will be disconnected from the surrounding when u put it on. Bass qas the main reason i bought this headphone and it didn't let me down. This headphone is very loud and can be uncomfortable for the ears after 2-3 hours of continuous usage.

Verdict - At the price range below 1000 it's a value for money with good sound quality and some minor cons which will be reduced to nothing after some time.",5
254,"Perfect Muisc Quality, except...","Perfect buy in this range.
Shape of Headphone's Outlet is Circular. So, if you are an avid listener who will use it for a long time, then probably not a good option as your ears will go nuts.
Otherwise, Music Quality, Built Quality and everything else is Perfect in this range. Looking forward to more from bOAt.",5
255,Good bass but misses treble,"Bought this headphone from the seller Appario retail.Seal was already broken when it was received.But headphones are in good condition ,like new(I guess). Headphone has good bass but misses treble sometimes,need to increase volume to get clarity of the sound.Padding is super soft and won't feel pain but don't expect much sound isolation.Good for the budget at Rs 700.",4
256,Don't buy not worth. Damaged in 10days,Dont go by the look as the Product damaged in no time. The wire is unplugged despite of the steel casing not worth as there is no response from Boat company or service center .. I bought it for almost 799 or so. It's not worth I should have spent this money on someother product. Low grade China product resold in India.,1
257,Not comfortable at all to use for more than 15 mins,"Look & feel is very good, sound quality also good, but it is very very uncomfortable to use the headphone for more than 10-15 mins. It pains badly to your ear. I do not recommend anyone to buy this product. Very bad design. I am writing this review after using this headphone for more than 6 months.",1
258,Worth the cost,"For this cost it's a good buy. It's good for teens and kids , for adults it may be a little small on the ears.",5
259,Amazing headphones at 599/-,"Review after one month of continuous usage - Very good as compared to other company's headphone in a similar price range (like Sony's MDR-ZX110A and JBL's C300Si). Bass is super good. Sound quality is awesome too. A bit of sound leak when listening to high volumes. noise cancellation is also good ( not very awesome) for at least this price range.
they feel somewhat tight for starting a few days but then loosen up in a couple of days. chord quality is good and the 3.5 mm jack is covered with nice protetion too. mic works fine too.
Overall very good if you get it under 650 (i got it for 599 :p)!!!",5
260,Very good headphone,"Delivery was quick and prompt, good packaging and product as described. In first opinion, the sound quality is good and the head phone is comfortable on year. Sufficient cable length. Construction is and finish is good. It seems it may last long. Not did any extensive testing",5
261,"Descent product , value for money","Excellent product, the sound quality is pretty good with adequate noise cancelling. The microphone is also fairly ok. A Bluetooth connectivity is missing would have been better if it's been there",4
262,"Excellent and dependable product,srill using it without a hitch .","Amongst the best products and price i oaid was worth every rupee.Awesome sound ,And the wire is long for tall oeople like me,goes from my Jean's pockets to my head and still have to fold it.",5
263,Nice Product,"These have been a welcome addition to our repertoire of gadgets that we have for online working/ learning circus. For the price that we paid, this comes as a steal! go for it.
Just to note the dynamic pricing algorithms that Amazon has... Just keep tab of the prices for a week and buy when you decipher that the product is at the lowest price.",5
264,Not for pubg user,Sound quality is good but i thought i can play pubg and can listen clearly where is coming my enimey but no because its not a good stereo headphone if you want for listening songs so it's fine according to price. I purchased in Rs 600. Not good for pubg.,3
265,This price it's very good.,Sound quality is very good bass also deep. But mic is not good it's get trrrrrrr background sounds when u talking and Have to get closer. I suggest it's very good for pubg also but mic is not good so go other headphone if u want to mic.,4
266,♥️♥️🔥🔥✨THE BEST HEADPHONES WITH THE BEST POWERFUL BASS..!!LOVED IT....,"The best product in such a affordable price range..

267,Boat BassHeads 900 : Amazing Headphone,"Sound Quality of this headphone is truly amazing.Beats are crystal clear.
Bass is really good.
This headphone comes with inbuilt microphone.
Voice is crystal clear whlle using this for calls.
Only negative thing about this headphone is that your ears may start paining if you use it for long time.It is little tight over the ear.But I just bought this a week back only.So may be after few days this may get adjusted with the ear.
Overall,I am happy with this awesome headphone :)",5
268,True Value to money and by far the best product at this price range.,"Excellent product by Boat. True value for money. Am proud of using this India made product, which can take the global giants headon, on an apple to apple competition and win comfortably.",5
269,Okayish product!,"After using more than 20 minutes, my ears started aching. Can't be used to longer duration continuously. Need to keep it off for a while then put it on again. Sound quality is pretty amazing though. Loud and clear. I dropped it once from a height of 5 ft and one side of the headphones stopped working which surprised me a lot. The durability isn't up to the mark.",3
270,Best of the Best,"I can't purchase anything better at this price. These have a better bass than my Mi earphones. The voice doesn't hurt in my ears and I am thankful for that. Pubg footsteps sounds are so clear that you can blindly find your enemies by following just the sound!!
Really happy I bought these!
Only Con-
There is sound leak on these headphones as I had read in many reviews before purchasing. Still one of my best purchases on Amazon after Realme 1!!

Edit- Due to the long wire, the wire got stuck in a rickshaw and broke. Will not recommend these headphones for people who travel a lot.",3
271,"Using since 3 months, Does not fit with the phone cover, heavy on head","Pros:
1. Sound quality is better that my laptop
2. Sturdy cord

Cons:
1. Does not fit with my iphone cover due to thick metal back of the plug
2. You start to feel the pressur in about 20-30 minutes",3
272,Excellent buy,"wow.. i did not expect a 559 rupees product is this much worthier... Bass quality, treble are excellent for the price.
ergonomics are good and enough . there is lot of sound leaking though speakers but i don't care abt it much.
Received next day after order. thankyou BOAT for excellent and cheap priced gem.",5
273,Good Headphone.,"Good . I never understood bass and treble hence regarding bass staring given one less star.
But one item missing in box i.e. additional ear buds which was/ is mentioned in product details.
Palatoo should see the problem shorted out positively.",5
274,Mic doesn't work well,"I like this product but the mic doesn't work~! It just doesnt record anything properly, there's always some background noise or static, so basically it doesn't seem like the mic works. I don't know if it's just a defect of the one I bought but can I get it replaced or something?",3
275,"Not so good,its over hyped","These are the main problems i faced and ones that needed to be considered:
1)Pain on ears,the headphones are much smallar than excepted resulting in pain in the ear due to use over time.
2)Too much bass to the point it destroys the music quality.The extra bass is too much that it feels artificial and not natural to music flow.
Good points:
1)Portable and well made",2
276,Sound quality is good but too tight for the ears,First of all it does not provide noise cancellation. Sound and bass quality is pretty good but it's too tight for the head. I am getting headache after I wear it for more than half an hour,3
277,Excellent sound clarity,This is my second purchase of same model. Voice is loud and clear. I am using Hesh 3 of skull candy but this sound clarity and loudness is even betrer then Hesh 3 which is 6.5 times costlier then this one.,5
278,not ideal.,"pros
sound =great
bass=Excellent
mic=good
wire =lasts long

cons
u can hear all conversation of ur family even in 80% volume .
poor passive noise cancelling.(becuase it doesn't cover whole ear ,it sits on it)
comfort is is utterly disaster.
anything more than an hour ur ears get go numb & there comes headache.

if u buy this product below ₹700 . it is best anything more it's best to save that money for blutooth earphones.",3
279,Decent Product,"Its a pretty decent product considering the price. The main proplem that i faced is that my ears started to hurt after using it for a long time. I think its because of the overtightness of the product.
Sound quality is good. Bass is not great as expected but good. It also has a good build quality. When considering the comfort its not that great but OK.
Apart from its not that comfortable, Its a pretty decent product.",4
280,Good Headphone for talking and listening songs,"1) Good for Talking.
2) Bass is good.
3) Wire length might be around 5feet.
4) Comfortable to use on moderate use but for long duration ears hurt sometimes.
5) Using it since October 2018
6) September 2019 now it's showing some problem in wire maybe because when the wire is adjusted the sound comes back to normal.",4
281,I loved it!,"boAt bassheads (black, wired, with in-line mic)
Delivery : 10/10
Product : 9.5/10
The only 0.5 I took was because : i would like to say if you're going to use it for a long time period, maybe go for something else. OnLY I found it a bit tempting to wear for more than 2 hours.
Else everything is perfect cuz it's boat, come on :) this price range, this is the most gorgeous headphones I've ever had!
I totally recommend this.",5
282,Worthy headphone,"Every one said in reviews that they got a defective or a 2nd hand headphone .but I received this hedphone on sunday 2 august
So,I dont know what kind of product i received but for now the headphone is working perfect and the box came with seal
So check urs
Buy from an good seller
Check weather the audio output of the headphone is perfect
I would like to give 4 stars of 5
Bass is nice
Noise cancellation is ok not so special
The mic quality is not so good
Build quality 4 of 5
This product is worthy for 799₹

———-THANKYOU———",4
283,Nusta 🔥🔥🔥🔥,"Although I am crazy about In-Ear headphones, but I bought these headphones for my laptop, so that I can attend meetings and calls. These headphones are AWESOME. I have also used headphones from other companies but used to get ear pain from them. It is not very tight. The quality of voice is very high, crystal clear voice, extra bass, extra thump. Overall this is a great choice.",5
284,AMAZING BASS AND SOUND FULL paisa vasool,"SOUND QUALITY : amazing experience very excellent and melodious it delivers crystal clear sound quality

Noise Cancellation : not satisfied need lots of improvement.

BASS QUALITY : amazing and super bass you can even feel it in 7d and 8D effects

Overall excellent for a music lover",5
285,!!!,"I placed the order on 8th Aug and the product was delivered on 9th....very quick delivery even though it is ""Sale"" season. The sound quality of the headphone is brilliant. It is actually feather light...with good sound cancellation. The only issue they dont have a return policy.. There is only replacement provided as it is electronics goods. Check properly before placing the order...",5
286,Some distracting noise(sha shh shaaaaaaa ssssssss sshhh ) comes while communicating,"Product quality looks good but on actual usage local headphones are better than this one
There will always be some disturbing noise
Does not fit over the head appropriately
waste of money",1
287,Price is okay. But not good for daily use. Harmful as it made me visit ear's Doctor,The weight of the headphones is light which is good. But it makes my ears pain so much that i cany explain . I have to visit a ENT doctor for my ears after using this headphones. And the soumd quality is also not good. When you are alone then the sound ia fine but when someone says something yu wont be able to hear the sound of the song in the headphones . Its been 10 days and i have started hearing scribbling kind of sound also in one ear,2
288,Mic is not working,"First i bought this product and returned this item for mic problem, after received new product i have faced the same mic problem, can't use this headset for call purpose.

Pros: Sound quality is ok for this price.
Cons:
* not comfortable on ears getting pain on ears after using this for an hour
* you can hear the music from this headset without wearing on ear.

Overall: Not recommended this china product for others try some alternate brands.",2
289,Not worth of any rupee,"I am not buying this product again because it's not good in fitting on the ears , sound quality is less than fine and product is fragile .
In future I would pay some extra to get a better quality headphone , something that can actually be usefull.",2
290,Nice,I bought two one for me and another for my brother. Everything is good except one thing - my ears hurt a bit (so does my brother's) after some time as it presses them down quite hard. This was not the issue with my previous one from a different brand.,4
291,very delicate,"Within span of days it was damaged. I called amazon customer care and informed the issue as it is under one year warranty. Amazon given respective product support mail ID, accordingly I tried to send request but the support mail has been not worked, since i tried so many times but no use, still the product with in the warranty I could not able to service that item",1
292,Good buy for the money i got it at!!,"Really a great buy for college students it has a good anount of bass and treble, the mids are awesome and this is a rugged headphone for college use for jogging and working out but even if a drop of water touches your mic and its done but rest is built well, its a great buy if you get it for 599 or so but 1k is abit too much gor this better than this at 1 k would be mi basic or snile jamaica or cx 180",4
293,Overall product is good with the short price ranges.,"Overall quality is good as per the price range they are providing. Sound clarity cant be expressed as excellent, but it is good.

Only feedback is the bass is too high that sometimes gives you ear pains and it purely depends upon the individual usage.

Would recommend to the people trying to have a branded headphone with small price ranges..",3
294,800 well spent,"Using it primarily for youtube and calls.

Mic pics up everything so not suitable for calls in crowded places. But then even a regular phone call would be a problem for the other side.",5
295,Economic version,"Only a basic headphones...
Obviously it will pain more than half an hour seems it's common in all.
If you increase volume - people next to you can hear what ever playing...only volume control and on off no notice cancellation...
It's a economy version...",5
296,Satisfied customer,"It's great headphone in this price range. I am writing this review after 2 days of usage
Fully satisfied with product no pain in the ear volume is loud enough i can't listen in volume so no problem in terms of loudness go for it it's amazing.",5
297,Not value for money and worst after after sales service,"This product is overall a good product, but the major issue is with it's jack and the boat after service is too bad.
I have given my product for the replacement and it's been more than 2-3 months they haven't done anything.
And now they don't pick up the call and when you raise a ticket it gets cancelled a automatically without your consent.
I won't recommend buying this as it's after service is really bad and not even Worth paying any Money on it",1
298,Seems to be China product,"Stopped working after 25 days of use, no damage no issues,but all of a sudden it stopped working, can't replace as it crossed the 15 days return time also...
Sound was of good quality but what's the use if we can't use for a month also.",1
299,extra bass? what is that?,"I ordered this product after reading a lot of rave reviews about its bass effect . Unfortunately, its sound quality just seemed average to me.. i had been waiting for it to come but the moment i heard some of my fave songs i nit, i was totally disappointed. no extra bass as promised. not sure if i have got a damaged product or something.. but i am not happy.",3
300,Very good headphones and value for money,"Good quality headphones with balanced high and mid tones abd clarity
Very good bass effect
Cushion pads are comfortable even for longer hours of usage
Mic is good, but felt it's placed too far, sometimes have to use it closer.
Mic pickup is very sensitive too, picks background noises, but that could be adjusted.

Overall good value for money.",4
301,Nice headphone for this price,"With so many varieties you get confused which one to buy and for how much. I went with this one for the price and the features and it had lived up to expectations till now. Have been using this for over two weeks, don’t see any problem. The sound is amplified and is clear, not too tight as some people mentioned. Overall worth the price.",5
302,Budget headphone.,"It's lightweight and comfortable to use for continuous 3-4 hours. I've used it more than that but its start to hurting after that. Sound quality is good at this range and noise cancellation is not that good but at this price range its what you expect. Bass quality is good but not that good after listening from other headphones. Maybe because I used different headphones in past. But its the best headphone in this range for the bass lover, try to get it on sale, the price drop from 799 to 650.",4
303,Put some more money & go for something better from boat,"Bass quality was average. There is nothing special in the noise cancellation on an average in every headphone you can get these kind of noise cancellation. Even sound quality was not outstanding but yes you can get clear audio.

My headphone cord was sound fast from the Jack section only after one and half month later. Most importantly it is from the junction.",3
304,"Not for true music lover, only for bass lover who can compromise with various sounds","I returned this headphones after using for two days. The bass is exceptional but the sound quality is very poor, I earlier used sony mdr zx 110a and clearly that had low bass but atleast the MIDS AND HIGHS WERE CLEAR AND BALANCED, here some frequency audio are not audible because the bass to boosted so much. and the sound meant to be heard in left ear is also heard in right ear, so you won't get good surround sound experience while watching movies",2
305,Good for gaming as well as daily usage,These headphones are really nice. I wanted a good gaming headphone but didn't want to spend much so i thought of trying it out. I used to believe headphones with bass don't give the perfect sound of footsteps in FPS games but these headphones proved me wrong. If anyone is not willing to spend over ₹600 on headphones i recommend these headphones for gaming as well as daily usage. Bought it for ₹550/- totally worth the price.,5
306,It worked ok for a month.,"within a month only 1 speaker is working. I am disappointed because I tried calling the number mentioned in the boat website for servicing nobody attends.
Now I have to junk it Just 1 month or little over a month. Close to a thousand bucks gone.
Now I have to invest more money which if I would invested in the first place I would have got a better quality one.",1
307,Excellent.......,"Very comfortable on Ear like a Feather..
And Bass is Superb , built quality also good.
But I didn't got Additional ear birds which was CLEARLY mentioned on product Description and feature page..
However boat product is Excellent !!
I got in offer period Rs.599 only.
Thanks Amazon ..",5
308,Nice product,"My daughter and her first cousin both the brothers loved the product as they are using it for school purpose die to online classes...very nice sound quality , easy to operate and consume very less space....noise cancellation feature is not available",5
309,Pathetic,It's not working when spoken with the customer care they straightky away told that due to lockdown they are not able to service it this is very pathetic so tequesting u all don't buy tjis untill the lockdown gets over its our hard money,1
310,Best-m-Best,"Very Nyc as asspected. It is really best (with mic) for my Online classes. And with this product warrenty of 1 years is also granted.
No noise, no eco,.. Sweet Voice.
I hope it would be Long lasting also.
I am suggesting to buy this product because it's very fair for Online classes as well as Listing sweet Songs.
Best-m-Best 👍
Shivam Kr.
THANKS 🙏",4
311,good enough for the price but the fitting is small,"Sound quality is decent, but lacks deep bass.
The fitting of the ear cups however is the deal breaker.
Under no circumstances can i see myself wearing this over my head for more than 20-30 mins.
i have big ears, and I'm not sure if I'm the only one having this issue.
But, I recommend looking for another product if you have big ears",3
312,Best for music and gaming,"BoAt is really a good manufacturer of sound equipment. For pubg mobile lovers just hit it. I'm using on my asus zenfone max pro m2 and I clearly heard the sound of enemies even like there were of more than 70 metres so we were easily wiping them. Played 2 match with a chicken dinner man. The delivery guy was too great to talk to as well. Amazon if you verify the order with comment then do give him a promotion for being so nice to customers. Everything related to this boat headphones is awesome from music playing to playing games like pubg mobile , call of duty etc.",5
313,Not Durable,Great sound quality both with music and call. Excellent bass. The only problem is durability after one year of use headphones broke at which cannot be repaired now I have to throw it even if it is working.,4
314,⛔️⛔️Must read before buying ⛔️⛔️,"Its an asome on ear wired headphone from boat the 5th most warable brand of 2020,
The sound quality is too good as compared its a small one in size, likely to use in travel, soft desin, metal and plastic mixed buit, all through an amazing one,the 3.5mm jack is more lasting one, Super quality

The prize increase and decrease
1399/799/674/742/......

So check and buy i buyed at 674...

Good product, liked it",4
315,Poor Quality,"After use of 15-20 days,
mic problem, in-line mic not working, and when connected headphones it automatically mutes all volume by reducing audio levels automatically, tested on different mobile phones, problem not solved. Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return",1
316,It can hurt your Ear if you wear Glasses 👓,"Pretty fantastic at this price
Noise Cancellation is okay (What do you except From this low budget huh!?)

Btw I wear spectacles, the headphones hurts mh back ear and it's not comfortable (Trying to solve this)
But I can surely recommend this.",5
317,Excellent,"I have been using this for a couple of days and find it excellent purchase. There is no strain on the ears even after hours of use, is adjustable, very good sound quality.",5
318,very good worth at this price,"I used wired Sony head phones, Boat head phones if we compare with Sony it could be better, but at this price I must say it's worth to purchase & it's sound is loud & clear",4
319,Best product for this price,"Very good sound quality. Excellent bass. Perfect headphones for this price for any PUBG player. It gives clear sound and also headphones vibrates when you shoot or getting shot at. Only downside is that It does not cancel noise and when you are playing game or any content on high volume, the person next to you can hear everything. But that is ok given the price of this product.",4
320,Don't read it coz u can't accept my review,"I had received this headset today only. However , i never expect this kind of low quality headset from boat. 6 months before I had purchases normal in ear headphone from boat. That one is good. Now i ordered on ear headset, but I am really disappointed with this product. Ear pain and over sweating. If you like this product means you can buy it. And this is my opinion and honest review about this product. Thank you",1
321,Value for money product but not very comfortable to wear.,"Pros - Good quality, good sound, good bass, not expensive.
Con - It's not designed for comfort. You can't keep it on for longer duration as it feels tight on the ear.",3
322,Best you can get at this price. I have used it for 7 months.,"This is the best headphone you can get at this price range.
I have used it for almost 7 months.
A month before the left side of this headphone stopped working. I raised a complaint on boat official website. They took it very seriously and picked up my headphone on same day.
Just because it was in warranty period they exchanged it with a new one and sent to me. It took almost 2 weeks.
The service of boat is cutting edge. I never seen such a beautiful service from a headphone making company.

If you want a quality and service both. You should definitely go for boat products.

Get plugged into nirvana.
My review after 7 months.

Sound- 8.5/10
Bass - 10/10
Build Quality - 8.7/10
Treble- 8/10
Service- 11/10 (they deserve 1 bonus point).",5
323,Surprisingly Good,For this price i wasn't expecting much. But i was surprised with sound quality and the base. The mic too gives good response. The passive noise cancelling too is effective considering it is not and active noise cancelling device. All in all for this price a good product.,5
324,Good for online meetings,"I have been using these headphones for over a month now for over 6 hours a day because of WFH. Thee headphones are lightweight. Since I use the headphones only for meetings, I cannot comment on the bass quality. All in all, a good headphone for zoom/google meet meetings.",5
325,Worthy Budget headphones 🎧,"Sound quality, bass, noice cancellation all is very good.

But ears will pain (Physical part) after continued usage of 45 -60 min
WORTH for the price.",5
326,Regreting this purchase,"It is a use and throw in bin item. Okay quality for some casual use without any expectations. Feels lighter on head, but only for few minutes. There is lot improvement necessary in design itself before one can ask for quality to improve in sound.",3
327,Best Headphones .Purchased twice and Experience is Fab,Best headphones much much much better than those costly headphones that output average audio . Don't go on the price this is the best thing you can get quality wise on Amazon. I have already purchased this twice so I know This is going to be eppic for the buyers.,5
328,Good Product,"Like the quality of the sound. Another important aspect is, tightness of headphones, this one does not hurt my ears at the same time keeps outside noise out. The cable is also quite long. Overall , I like it.",5
329,NOT THAT GREAT!,"Impressive in the beginning and attractive because of the huge discount they give, but I'd say it is originally only worth that much.
It worked well for the first 6 months, after which the end pin has become loose and I have to keep tightening and pushing it inside harder every five mins to be able to hear from both sides.
10 months from date of purchase, and my mic has completely stopped working.",3
330,After 1 year and 4 months of use,"This is the best product i ever come to.
Sound quality is pretty good, it is durable even after rough use, it had fallen few times from height 5 ft but no effect on but be careful while dealing with it.
Pros- 1)quality sound
2) noise cancellation-upto the mark
3) durable
4) bass- met the demand from any music lover

Cons- it is not working properly now,(after using 16 months period),inner wire loses but can be fix",5
331,Read it fully choose your choice,Very useful.. I'm Bass lover.. Aim for high bass.. But this product gives that bass what I expected.. It is so cool. . The quality is so good..one thing don't pull the wire. If u pull the wire.. U loss your hearing. Bcuz the copper wire is cut quickly.. So use it carefully.. Some reviews tells it..if u use more 1 week u have ear pain.. It is a lie answer. . When u inject in phone and increase the volume .. U see the limit of hearing if u cross the limit u ear must damage. . I didn't cross the limit and use the headphones up to 16 hrs but there is no pain . Only one thing u feel. . Your ear pressed towards face. . If u use Contiuesly u can't feel about that..,5
332,Complete Review after usage of a week,"First of all, it is worth its price, i got this at 599 which is ok for it.
I had a great experience listening to songs with it. Before buying, i read some reviews here mentioning i causes ear pain and is tight. But let me tell you, i have not experienced it till now. It is ok for about 30 minutes continuous usage as i already told it is for those people who listen songs for about half an hour. For movies and all, i had my earphones which came with my phone.
Honestly speaking, my experience with it is excellent and average both depending on thw music i am listening. Bass is also like that. It is just outstanding sometimes and good on few occasions but not bad at any time.
Sound quality is damn good.
It is adjustable so if u feel uncomfortable, just adjust it according to ur head shape.
It is foldable too and build quality looks good too. Also doesn't makes any sound while adjusting or folding.
Overall i am impressed with this product.
And yes as it is bass focused headphone , it sometimes compromise in sound quality but is around 1 or 2 times out of 10. So it is ok.
But at this price, it is ok.
Completely worth the money.
I am continuosly listening to music since 7 days and i feel awesome everytime i plug it in.
As i wrote this long long review, it is understood that i liked this so much and it is a good product and i should be known to others too.",5
333,Good For the Price ... But,"I felt like it is good for the price, bought it under 600/-. The issues faced was mic quality is poor and Pain in the ears which was a trouble wearing it even for a couple of minutes.
Note * : These may vary within people.",4
334,Horrible audio quality,"Horrible audio quality. No bass, cant hear few layers of audio. Its like so flat. Sent for replacement thinking that headset I got is faulty, but found that this headset itself has worse audio quality",1
335,Good,"I will give marks out of 10

Bass : 8/10
Noice cancellation 6.5/10
Sound Quality : 9/10
Comfortability : 7/10 (Ears starts paining after 2.5 to 3 hours of continuous usage)
Product quality: 6/10 (quite flexible)
Microphone : 8/10
1 problem that i faced after 4 months of usage that the spring got bend god knows how??! I have added an image u can see it.

Now should u buy it or not ?
Yes u can buy it its good at a price range of 800 - 1000
Total Paisa Wasool!",5
336,"1 day review ""awesome"".","1 day review. The build seems okayish. The sound and bass quality is good. The fit is perfect. It doesn't feel too tight nor too loose. Noise cancellation is good, bass is awesome if you tune with some equilizer. Overall good product for 599 bucks. Go for it. *I will update over time.*",4
337,Good headphones,Quality is looking quiet good at first.. Need to check how it goes in coming time..... Will edit the review after 6 months for long term review.... Sound quality is good as par price.,5
338,Yes it is beautiful..,"Love at first sight when I openend it. Yes it met all my expectations..just a thing to mention that sound does leak when on high volume..
Bass is superb no doubt. Excellent look.
I dont know why few have mentioned about that these are tight to wear..I am a constant user of over head phones, these ones are the best fit I have got till now..haven't felt any pain at all..rather these are soft to ear.",5
339,Very disappointed with this product,"Not as good as expected compared to boat rockerz 600. The head band is not comfortable, the plastic part looks cheap. The only thing I like is the foldable part, very compact and the cable is very good. Over all it's below average. Don't buy it if the price is higher than 700 - 800 at this price you can get a Ubon wireless headphone eith sd card slot and fm plus the sound quality is almost the same like boat bassheads 900.",3
340,Too good,"The quality is too good. Caused a bit of ear pain during the initial days of use .But after I got used to it ,I felt this is the best product for such a price. Packing was also neat, on time delivery.",5
341,For general use only,"At this price this product is godd for buying, but the bass boosted hype is false, is is good for general use, but I can say that the sound quality is not very good and bass also not very good, it is good at this price, if you want good quality then you should go for jbl headphones",3
342,Don't get fooled by the discounted price,"All of my family members tried it on. Elders, youngsters, kids...It does not fit on anyone's head. The design is defective and so is the huge discount. We can't return it because of the policy. Please don't buy this product.",1
343,Best headphone considering the price.,"I bought this headphone only for music and battle royale games and I can say this is the best headphone one can get at this price point. Bass is good for me as I don't like headphones with high bass. Sound quality is good and clear. And for gamers, you can go with this headphone if you want a good positional audio. It won't give you the 7.1 surround sound feeling like Logitech G Pro, HyperX Cloud but you can surely locate the enemy with their footsteps.",5
344,Awesome Product!!!,"I received it very second day of the order, thanks Amazon for quick delivery, enjoying it since last couple of days.

Pros:
1. Superb Build Quality
2. Crystal Clear Sound
3. Good quality wire
4. Looks premium

Cons.
1. Bass as well as Noice cancellation could be made better

Overall its a good over the ear headphone, you can definitely go for it.",4
345,"Decent product, but poor after sales support","I really had liked this product once. But this has the same issue with ear cushions as my previous product. The ear cushions came off after an year and I could not get to fix it. They have no authorized service centers and after warranty period , you can only throw away the product if there is a defect",2
346,Just Go for It!,"Ignore the negative reviews!
Just buy it!
I just bought it for ₹674.
I also had doubts after reading the negative reviews, but i highly recommend you this headphone!
Nice build quality!
Nice sound quality!
Decent Bass!
Overall, The best branded headphones you'll get at this price range!",5
347,Superb product,"This product is simply superb and the only problem I found with this was it had a spring at the plugging section which makes it difficult to place our hand during gaming....quality of sound and bass is awesome......

Also the sound can be easily heard outside which i think is one of the cons of this product...and the head may ache after prolonged use...so it's better to adjust the tension by stretching and placing it over some item",5
348,worked well... for 3 months,"Exactly 3 months after purchase, the device is not functioning... Tried to contact service centre, the only option i have is to travel to and fro 30 kms to get this thing repaired..
Save yourself this hassle, buy a different one !!",1
349,Nice and basic,"Okay for using it occasionally, as using it daily can hurt your ears. It is very basic, the built quality is good, ear cushions are comfortable, the headband is stretchable, and the 3.5 mm jack is really sturdy. Once folded, can be carried easily without any hassle.",4
350,Worth buying,I m using this product from 1month and i must say that this is really a awesome product ...i will say that buy this product with eyes closed ...really value for money headphone ...sound the base and everything is just perfect in this price .... Thank you boat for providing value for money product 💗,5
351,Average Product,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I'm using this for my PC.
Sound quality is not good at all.At starting months,it seemed awesome to me.
After a use of 6 months...
When the noise is full,it could be heard upto 2 meters,and person sitting next almost gets disturbed.
I didn't expected this from boAt.
The hardware(Body) is good as expected and good ear cushions.
It has average noise cancellation too.",3
352,Totally Recommended if you are searching for good quality headphones at low price,"Likes: it's of really good sound quality for this range of price... And as mentioned the bass is just awesome! And it's really soft at the ear and head part... And extremely light
Dislikes: the ear part could've been made a little larger... And ur ears heat up really fast after a fee minutes of use... Approximately 10 to 15 minutes of use... I request that something must be done regarding that...
Overall: 100% recommended!!!

That's it!",5
353,A value headphone with decent sound quality,"At this price point I could not have expected anything better. The bass is not really that great but I am OK with it.
The major attractions for me are that it is very light and easy on the ear. I have never tested the microphone really som cannot comment. But all in all I am very much content with this buy.",5
354,Stopped working well within 2 months,"The plug got loose within two months of gentle use. It gets loose and people can't hear me in the call, I have to keep adjusting it. Sometimes i loose sound on oneside of the speaker.",1
355,Works for me,"They are sturdy enough.. and has enough long wires to the jack. A little tight when worn for longer times.. But overall at this price.. its a good buy. If youre looking for a economical and durable headphone, with a boat tag to it.. Go for it.",5
356,Online Classes,Bought it for daughter's online classes as we needed headphones with a mic. Using it since past 3 months and the headset is a heavenly blessing. She's 5 year old yet it fits right for her head.,5
357,Durable,"Superb sound quality, adjustable, comfortable.
Would strongly reccommend to buy this, worth the price.
8 Months since I bought this product still in good condition.",5
358,Best in the budget,"I bought it for dual purpose- for my kid to attend online class and for me - on office calls and listening to songs. It serves the purpose perfectly.

In addition, it provides great sound quality with bass and the built quality looks good.

The only issue I found now was the sound audible outside when the volume is kept high which is expected",5
359,Better than Sony Red Headphones With Mic,"I love it. The app was showing it would come on 9pm but the delivery was there 5 hours early. When I first tried these headphones, there were speakers on the round thingy. I thought they were speakers but my mother it's just for design but she tried it, I went closer and could hear which song she was listening. I was so happy. Then I thought these were better than the Sony red headphones with mic.
Delivery - 5 stars
Sound quality - 5 stars
Noise cancellation - 5 stars
Bass quality - 5 stars",5
360,Amazing Sound and Bass but...,"The product is really good. Great Audio quality, good bass are some its pros. The noise cancellation, however, is not that good.

However, there are two things that I didn't like about this one. The first is that It is a bit tight out of the box (as most of the reviews tell) and it starts hurting your ears after long usage.
The Second is that the extension part, when extended, is sharp and if you are one of those who tend to put their headphones around their neck when not using, believe me, the sharp edges WILL CAUSE IRRITATION.

Other than that, this is a great deal and you should definitely go for it if the cons aren't big for you.",4
361,Never buy.,"This is very bad product. It heats. It create health issues to me.
After using this, I am getting headchce for 1 week continuously.
I got dizziness issue continuously.
If you want all the problems, you are at right place. Choice is yours.",1
362,Best in this price segment.,"Yes they serve what they say, extraaaa bass.
But this makes other sounds like middle and treble look a little dull so you may have to adjust your equalizer.
The fitting seems fine to me and doesn't seem to cause any pain, they are comfortable actually.
If you find some stares or judgemental looks then you should know to lower your volume as the sound leak is high in these headphones.
Rest is satisfactory and I think it's worth the price.",5
363,Mic quality is not good,The mic is not sensitive enough to sense the sound when the mic is hanging in its natural position. You will need to hold the mic ner your mouth so that the other person can hear you properly. Very difficult when you are on official calls and one hand is busy holding the mic only,2
364,Value for money,Best for gaming purpose. I used it for playing pubg. I can clearly hear enemy's footsteps from 50-70 meters away. But at starting the headphones feel tight and your ears start to pain after 1 hour using them. But eventually they become lose and you don't feel the pain.,5
365,Recommended for work and Listening to Music. Above Average.,"I'll give an above average rating for the product after 1 month use. The length of the wire is longer than expected, which makes it hard to carry around. Except the length of the wire, the product is great. I use it to connect to system and mobile for work and music respectively. Good product with sound quality and bass. Noise cancellation needs a little improvement.",4
366,Please Change this product,"Sound quality great but 3.5mm audio jack malfunction.not working properly.Repeated voice is more frequent.phone silent automatically.The spring which is 3.5 mj, it makes a mistake twice and now the voice is more frequent.This problem is coming after 15 days.And now I can not even return it.",5
367,Bad quality go for Sony Mdr or Jbl instead of this shit,After one Year....Headphone jack Stop working it's not recognize the mic Bad quality I can't return bcoz it's been 1 year 4 days so not in warranty and customer support is also so so so bad,1
368,Value for money 💵,"As I was not expecting a super high quality sound, I am satisfied with what this product have got.
I’ll say that people are fool who are paying ₹700 for Headphones and expecting sound like ₹17000 Headphones. Common Guys, be real like this Headphones.

Honestly you can’t get anything better than this at this price tag of ₹700

Thanks.",5
369,Highly recommended,Fully satisfied. I purchased three of this and one Boat bluetooth headset. I also have one wired earplug from the same brand. So far no issues with any. I will highly recommend Boat for those who are looking for best quality in budget range. Thanks boAt 😊,5
370,Amazing.....value for money,"Its a very good product at this price range ....
I am writing this review after 18 months from purchase ... It worked for 18 months and that's very good at this price of 800 only ...
It is very light weight .... Easy to carry ... Built quality is very amazing .... Sound quality is amazing ....bass quality is amazing .....overall this product is very amazing I would buy it once again if needed ......",5
371,Ok,"Product was great
But after 2 years of use it showed defect. its left right ear stopped working because i used a chinese feature phone with it. So please use it with good quality smartphones",4
372,Bad cable,"Have to deal with wired headsets very carefully. On the contrary I had bought the Amazon Basics on ears headphone 3yrs ago and still going strong, no cable issues except that the sponge covers come off ...

Boat headphones have lost it in cable department",2
373,Good Headphone,"Good Headphone. New White color looks very stylish but will become dirty, but looks great now. Have a JBL 250si also. But JBL lacks the deep bass of this Boat headphone. Only one area where it could have been better is that the high frequencies could have been more clearer. But overall at Rs.799, great buy from Amazon. Value for money.",4
374,Till 1 year OK after 1 year 🤐,Honestly I used it for about 18 months now it stopped working. If you are a rough and tough user beware then bcoz Jack areas where wire connect can get problems. Everything is fine music or videos but yes call problems are there people sometimes complain that voice is not audible when I was doing whatsapp calls. But if you ask me its good product to take but keep in mind after 1 year alarming bells will start playing bcoz it can stop any time.,5
375,Boat super excellent,"Overall boat headphone is good at this price point.....bass,sound,trouble excellent and durable on ears I had tried for more than 1 hour it's not pain in ears...I am also using boat 225 more than 2 years it's still working excellent...so if u wasn't wired headphone than blind go for it I got at 550only it's best deal at this price",4
376,Very average!,"The quality of the product is very average but for this price its ok.. After the use of 1 day.. It one side of the product stopped working, it kinda gave me a shock but after some time it was normal.. I been a boat customer of past 3 yrs and this is my tip for u incase u r purchasing... Keep the warranty card n invoice receipt somewer safe because it never last for a year!!!",3
377,Good sound but cord may cause problem,"The product has very good sound quality and value for money. However, if you spectacles then the headphones may cause some pain behind earlobes (but this may happen with any of similar over-the-ear headphones). One problem I observed is with the cord; it stains clothing when coming in close contact for long time. Especially if you don't like hanging cord and have habit to tuck the hanging cord inside you shirt, then the cord stains inside of shirt and the inner-wear.",5
378,Rather than Boat go for a different brand for this price range!!!!,"Pros-
Cheap headphone with good audio quality under this price range🤗

Cons-
1.Bass is not that deep.😑
2.This is a weird one- Due to very slight movement sometimes the headphone jack gets disturbed and suddenly Google home pops up out of nowhere when using it on mobile. And this occurs almost every time. I need to be very careful while connecting headphone to mobile so as not to disturb the headphone jack😑",2
379,Issues in product within 2 weeks of purchase,It was delivered on 8th Sept-2020 & I started using it from 9th. No issues for 1st two weeks but from 3rd week suddenly the microphone started giving me trouble. Now the next person can barely hear me. I need to take it to the service center in COVID situation.,2
380,A happy customer!,"The best headphones I have ever bought so far! It's easy on the ears, reduces noise and great sound. It's especially better than earphones for young children doing their online classes or music.

Extremely happy with the product.",5
381,Sound quality is perfect but not the comfort.,I am using this for now 1 year now this headphones can handle rough use. Sound quality in excellent bass is good noise cancellation is also good for loud and punchy music this are best. But headphones don't offer comfort after 1 hour of continue usage my ears start to hurt the cushioning is not that soft. If u r loud and punchy music lover these r for u but if you watch movies then you should go for more comfortable headphones.,3
382,"Not bad , but can be improved","One bad thing is it's hurn on head, as all the caution is provided on the top instead of in the bottom , which touch head .

Another bad is not tight enough on head to do some jumping excercises.

Good part is, it's cheap and good for listening music and attending meetings .",4
383,Excellent product 👌👍,"Excellent product 👍

384,MIC NOT WORKING... HOW DO I RETURN OR EXCHANGE IT?,"I ordered this product on 4th January 2021. In less than 3 months the mic stopped working. Now when I am trying to return this product, it says the return window closed on 12th January 2021. It said 1 year warranty. So how do I return it or exchange it.",1
385,Very comfortable,"Lovely headphones.
Noise cancellation and comfortable for ears.
Ordered it for WFH purpose because of the long meetings and calls, Totally worth it.
Thanks!!!",5
386,Best for the bucks,This is worth the money spent. I bought these as the mic in my old one stopped working (different brand) and it was not prime eligible on amazon. I am thankful for that because this is much better than my old one. Where I had to keep 100% volume in my old one I need only 65% on this one and the mic clarity has been appreciated by others,5
387,Long Hour Office purpose headphones,"Sound Quality- Good. Good for daily calling. Office purpose headphones.
Noise Cancellation- Good. Lower the outer noise upto 10 dB
Bass quality- Good. Happy that they are not those extra extra bass type headphones. Good for long hours.
As they are headphones so they create pain on the outer side of the ear. However it become normal with the time.",4
388,OP Purchase,"Best One from the Boat.
Very much durable at a reasonable price.
I am using Boat Rockerz 450, Bassheads 225, Boat 102 earphones, Boat speakers and this product
They all are just value for money",5
389,Nice and affordable,"This headphone is good and is at affordable price
It has nice bass quality and it gives a feeling of club
But the only problem with it is very loose
It may be that my face is small but I have purchased many headphones but they weren't loose but this one is very loose which is the only demerit . Otherwise this one is good and affordable.",3
390,Fair product for the price,"Best product for the price. No noise cancellation. Bass is good , sound is clear, but not suitable for long hours, not suitable for rough use, cable quality is good. Definitely recommend to buy",4
391,Please Dont Buy....,"Product is not upto the mark, i have purchased this for my regular office calls. Audio quality is good but i am getting ear pain and it will be there for some time after removing the headset..

Suggestion: Please check the return policy and buy the product because the seller from whom i have bought dont accept returns but accepts replacement.",1
392,Great investment.,"I got this for 899 and this was the best investment that I made ever for headphones. I don't know why people here are saying they can't wear it for more than 1-2 mins but I wear it for at 7-8 hrs a day and it is super comfy. Also to mention sound quality and bass are awesome, only one downside that the noise cancellation is not very good, which is not an issue for me.",5
393,Poor quality mic,"Within a month of buying this product, the mic stopped working. The other end cannot hear me at all although the speaker is working well. This is now useless as I needed this to take online calls for WFH. What's the use of good sound quality / good noise cancellation / bass qua;lity if you cannot use it for the main purpose you buy this for.",1
394,As per the above if there will be a exchanged offer will come please reach out to me,"It is not comfortable for the ears
We took it coz of it's headphones type but it would not have soft to the ears and so much painful, I didn't use except 2-3 times as purchased newly, I wish that if I may possible to cancel it and purchased another product of boat if the company would really want or have a genuine intension to help and give the satisfaction to the customers",1
395,Don't make this mistake,"The below review was just the first impression that we all have of hinese products....this was a waste of money, even when i opted for replacement, they gave me a defected product....this boar will drown soon!!!!!!

Awesomeones with superb sound quality and bass....even at highest volume the sound is clear....design is very attractive and voice calling is also clear (mic quality)

Only a little concern is that it becomes a bit uncomfortable after wearing it continuously for more than 20-30 minutes...overall nice product and must buy",1
396,Excellent product,The quality of product is great at this price. Sound quality is also really good. If you are looking for a low cost and good quality headset you can definitely for this product.,5
397,ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCT FOR YOUR LONG LASTING USE.,Very helpful can easily hear the words crystal clear. Long enough wire to move here and there . One of the best wired headphone . If you thinking to buy a great and long lasting wired headphone I think you should definitely go for this as it is the best product and I am still having the same amazing experience which I had on the first time.,5
398,Okay product but could have been better,Sound Quality is not good if you want it for listening music or watching movie...but it is okay for attending online calls for those professional or students who would like to use it frequently for online meeting or training purpose.,4
399,"Music Lovers Dont Go for it, Call or Conference Call office use worth it","1.Its not for music lovers
2.Bass is missing
3.Mic works great so office guys can use it for calling purpose or listening to conference calls make pleasant.
4.Head rest material is so thin that even with your casual hard grip can shatter.
5.Plastic material is cheap",3
400,Ear pain,This headphone are best and have very good bass but it's not for watching movies or songs or long yt vedios .this headphones are so uncomfortable.and if u wear them for 1hour Ur ear will start paining and howl day Ur ear will in pain.so uncomfortable headphones plzz don't by it🙏and there is no return policy just don't buy it,1
401,At ₹599 go for it,"1.its comfortable
2.sound has good bass
3.bought only for pubg and movie watching,mic is on our left side so u HV to speak little louder
4.handle with care
I purchased at ₹599
It's value for money
Earlier I bought boat 400 at ₹1499 later it was available at ₹999 ,but I returned it as it was not comfortable,ur earlobe will pain after using 30+min so comfort level of boat 900 I like more than boat 400,",4
402,Good product.,"For the price the sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality is good. Its not the best and I believe that it can be made better but still its value for money. I like the product. Its durable and has quality. I bought the product for my sister and she has been using the product for almost 3 months now and she is happy.",5
403,Do Not Buy This,Don't Buy this. Why I am saying this because the head band is very tight and it causes pain in ear after just 10-15 mins of usage and believe me this sole factor is enough to not to buy this you will not be able to enjoy the music no matter the sound quality. And worst of all you cannot even return it only replace it which is very bad as a consumer.,1
404,Not comfortable to wear.,I found these headphones very uncomfortable to wear. I was using Sony headphones earlier. So thought of giving Boat a try. But my regretting buying them.,3
405,Cushions r perfect...wll ache after long use,Perfect product for all comaptible devices.....the aux jack with spring wiring protection is a plus point....its a hardy and premium looking headphone......only con is it wll pain after 1:30 hrs if u r a long time listening music lover......except that everything is perfect in this price range.....cushions r of good quality nd the whole profuct is foldable which makes it eaay to carry,5
406,Missing Accessories,"Product is okay but accessories mentioned in Amazon website was not provided and Amazon asking to return instead of replacement or providing misssing accessories.
Since it was ordered for WFH calls nmeetings etc so can't return.",4
407,Not up to the mark,I have used boAt Bassheads 162 earbuds for a year and will say that the sound quality of this one is nowhere near to it. Sounds muffled and the bass is not that strong. Build quality is good and should last longer if used carefully which is the case with any other headphones.,3
408,Bass Lovers and Ok Comfort,Best for bass heads...good sound staging...decent mids and vocals....one main problem is comfort...u get pain very soon within 1 hr. Also build quality is not that good for long term. And cushion both material and comfort is below average. But i bought for 450rs effective price...so Best value for money,4
409,I used it for almost 2 years,"Honestly I have to tell that it is the best headphones under budget. Bass is too good. Sound quality awesome. But the only problem is it's not durable. U have to use it with lot care. I have the habit of sleeping while listening to music so due to this it broke.. the bendable part came out but still it was working fine until finally the jack got destroy recently.

So overall it is the best headphone if u use it with care.",3
410,Exceptionally Unexpected Quality,"Yes, that's what I got. I ordered this headphone to work on videos for editing, and it is serving the purpose very nicely, in an amazing way. There are some reviews that say that it is tight. That is true, but it is required for the quality that it offers.",5
411,Best sound quality,"Speaker quality is very good for listening songs, good amount of bass, good passive noise cancellation, giving 4 starts just because it’s become uncomfortable to use after 1-2 hrs of usage. Don’t use this for office calls usages.",4
412,Too much fragile !😐,Build quality is too bad the screw on the left side of the headphones fell down after few minutes of use....I have to return it due to this problem ...hoping that they will refund the money ...if they had the replacement options the I would have done that but they don't have replacement only refund so...if you are fold it on use roughly it gonna damage easily,1
413,Best in this price,"These headphones are just amazing. Boat never disappoints. The sound and bass quality is great for the price, also it provides amazing noice cancellation. Totally recommend it. Don't give a second thought and just buy it.",5
414,Great bass for this price range..,"Awesome bass and looks classy in white. Using it continuously for 2 months and then writing a review.
Best deal in this price range.. this is my first boat product and happy that it's perfect..",5
415,"Bad quality, earbuds got damaged after 5 months mild use. Go with Philips or Sony","I bought boAt Stone Grenade 5W Bluetooth Speaker(Charcoal Black) and boAt Bassheads 900 On Ear Wired Headphones(Carbon Black), both sound quality is average, headset's earbuds got damages in 5 months use. Please go with some standard one like sony or Philips. I have one 7 years Sony, still mint condition.",1
416,Honest and short review,"My first impression
I didn't like the ear pads. They are uncomfortable and tight.
I read such similar reviews and I am experiencing the same.
I started listening songs and liked the bass effect and overall sound effects.
OVERALL GOOD.",4
417,This is a superb deal at this price.,This is a superb deal at this price in a festive season. Ergonomically designed to suit any ear. It is an on-ear headphone. Sound quality is pleasant. Ear cushions are great. Bass quality could have been better along with high frequency. wire has been taken care with armor guard to prevent bending. You can go for it. Headphone will not de-satisfy you. I have checked the microphone also. It doesn't show any distortion. Easy to receive and end the call with one touch button. I am satisfied.,5
418,Bass awesome,"Bass is awesome
Noise cancellation is not upto mark
Good for music. The metal guard at the 3.5mm connector is good. It shall protect the breakage which normally occurs near the connector.",4
419,Affordable.... Best u can get,What most I liked was the mic quality. It is perfect as working for home. So my main reason was for work for gamming it would be grt too.. the sound quality is also grt. Rest for music i have no idea as not a music person. I am satisfied with the product as per my requirements. The only thing i didn't like was the cable as it's thick.,5
420,Not comfortable to ears,"#read whole review

No doubtly sound is very very premium quality. And wire is also very good. Most highlighting part is its super base.....fabulous base.....#but not comfortable in wearing. It will cause your ear pain just after wearing it for 4-5 mins. It is not only with me it happened with everyone who weared it in my home.",5
421,Poor audio,Poor connector - need to toggle the connector jack repeatedly. Okay at low volumes but too much noise at higher volumes. Only positive is that it's cheap,2
422,People complaining of static noise,"The headphone's wire is very loosely attached to the pin. When you move while speaking on phone, the other party hears an irritating krrrrr krrrrr krrrrr sound continuously. Faced this problem in a brand new Boat headphone. Now forced to throw it away.",1
423,Quality one for a reasonable price,Nice product had a good voice experience with it.It also has a warranty card and a warranty which lasts for one year and enabling it is so simple.Loved it.Some people says that it causes earpain but to me it is a perfect fit one.,5
424,2 years of daily use.,"Awesome headphones.
1. U like bass go for it. 9/10 (indian thing)
2. Sound clearity 9/10.
3. Extra protection at connector.
4. Easily portable in compact form.
5. Built quality 8/10 ... watch out for the point where mic is connected. Rest flexible and sturdy.
6. Your friends wouldn't believe u got these for 799/699.

Reviewing after rough , everyday use for 2years.",5
425,Boat Bassheads 900,"So it's been more than a year since i bought this great value for money headphones.
After using it for so long, I'll state the Pros and Cons for this product.
Pros:
Sound Quality and Bass are on point
Sturdy Build Quality,It's build to last
Easy to handle and carry.

Cons:
The only con i found associated with bassheads 900 is that it's not suitable for long periods of usage. As after an hour my ears start to hurt.",5
426,Pocket friendly product,"It’s been one year now that I am using this headphone. Good product. I have watched movies, I have taken long calls- this headphone gives my ear comfort in these long ours. Exactly what I wanted. So you can go for it. Pocket friendly",5
427,Kaam chalau ...,It's good if u are buying due to your budget ... it's like kaam chalau product ... means to show that u have a premium company's headphones... it came with some few very little scratches... but not a problem ... it's not visible that much ... I say you to look more varieties ... if it's getting fit to your budget then go for it ... it's not tht much worse ... but it's good 👍🏿👍🏿,4
428,Best for music...but not for gaming,"Better build quality than compared with sony,,,,but the noise cancellation is not at all good ,,the outer sounds cc an easily enter ur ears,,,and it will fix on ur ear...it presses ur ear more than a normal headphone....and also it is not at all good for gaming .....and for pubg other games can't get any more advantage through this headphones 900......but more better for music lovers.....",5
429,Average product need to correct many cons,"Pros: look good,
Sound bass is perfect
Cons:
Noice cancellation not perfect
Ear get pain not because of sound, just because of design. Too much stress applies both ears.

Need to correct ear pain it should more flexible over head.",3
430,Must have item specially in this price segment . Super bass . Worth buying.,"Super and balanced bass . No distortion even at high volume . Vocals are clear and crisp no issues with that . Tribbles are ok . So over all it's a worth buying . Only issues I discovered about its prasticy feel and cracky sounds but it's for budget . Cables are good , long and durable . The jack is different and has a spring for bend prevention . The cushions are so soft and comfortable . You can easily be able to listen music more than an hour .",4
431,The Worst headphones at this price point,"These are the worst headphones Ever , your money would go down the drain after 3 - 4 months of usage its creating a lot of problems it even stops working at sometimes , not happy with the performance .😔 even the noice cancelling is not that great",1
432,Good Product,"Good product at its price range.
Good quality
Nice and occupies less space to carry
Overall good product. If, usb is available for the same product, it will be excellent in its price range",4
433,"Only good for Listening purpose, Not good for Call or communication","I purchased this for my office call purpose. But it's mic quality is very low. the Front person cant here your voice until and unless you keep mic towards your mouth by hand. So If you want only to listen music get this, else go for any other option. For laptop users it's of no use. Don't buy this.",2
434,Good Value For Money Product,"Considering the price the sound quality is good. Even the head adjustment is quite good and may fit to all kinds of people. Another useful thing is the spring at the 3.5mm jack, it will prevent from breaking the wire.",4
435,Great headphones at the price point.,"Great headphones at the price point. Even the microphone is good. It stays closer to the mouth and it does not fall back on the face. Overall a very good product.

The head bands are little tight, but over use, it won't bother you.",5
436,Not good bad durability,Stopped working within a month and a half. Got it replaced from the manufacturer. Even the replacement stopped working!,1
437,Worth the money,"Very good quality headphones. Sounds like we are sitting in theatre. Soft sound feels very relaxed listening songs with this Boat Headphones.

Worth the money, super quality.",5
438,"Durable, great sound quality and a steal!","The bass is nice and well balanced. The headphones are a steal at ₹499 for me. They work we but can pinch a user on the ears after 2 hours of continuous usage. The fitting could have beeh better.
Pros :
1. Great build quality on the 3.5mm jack and overall sound quality on the headphones is pretty good for the price!
2. Great treble and rock music playback is awesome.
3. A steal at the price, VFM 10/10

Cons:
1. A metallic built headphone unit would have been better. The plastic makes it basic.
2. Not very comfortable to wear.
3. Bass isn't the best. 7/10
Sound quality: 7.5/10
VFM: 9/10",4
439,Simple and elegant headphones,A simple and elegant headphones which are very light and can be easily used whole day while you are attending virtual calls that has become necessity in post CVOID-19 situation.

Interms of voice and mic are good quality.",3
442,Disaapointed with the quality,"Having used the very good earphones from BOAT, I went for this headset, but turned out to be a disaster. Apart from the high volume, it highly lacks in bass.",1
443,One of the best ever wired headset.,This product is marvelous. I'm writing this after using it for 3 days. It's sound quality is just awesome. This is basically for those who want a bombastic sound without disturbing others. Boat has made an awesome product and it's not less than other top brands. Also it costs less hence everyone can use it.,5
444,Smart buy,"in medium volume, u can feel the smoothness of the songs where in high, yu can experience the total audio of the movies. U can feel the discrimination of the sound as well as the place of the sound.",4
445,Best sound quality under 1000Rs.,Sound quality is best under 1000 range. Extremely satisfied with the sound quality. Bass and treble are also great. But Not that very much comfortable. Not recommended using for long hours. The rexine used is that not much great.,5
446,Best Headphone,"Absolutely love this product. The sound quality is so awesome. I don't know how it is possible to provide this product at such a low cost, because I have used headphones of many brands and those at a price 2 or 3 or 4 times of this does not provide this level of bass. Thanks Boat for this amazing product..!!",5
447,Not at all durable product.,I have bought this headphone for my daughter so that she can use it for her online classes. The sound quality was quite good. It just worked fine for 5 months. Very disappointed with the longevity of the product.,5
448,Poor Quality. Footpath Item Better than this,Poor Quality. Footpath Item Better than this. Pin Broken after first insert itself. First time in my life stereo pin gone. The worst part is my phone struck other half. I need to go to service center for this. Phone got damaged due to this. Refund is not initiated even after one week also.,1
449,Quality and my experience,"The warranty is useless because. I as a user I can give you warranty of more than two years
Many YouTuber were saying In video that this are tight but,
in my experience I never fell any pain. I use them for heavy bass and heavy gaming.
At last:- At this time
You will not get better then this Headphones
In this price range",5
450,Good sounding headphones.,"Foldable, compact & sturdy as well. Let's hope it lasts longer than the 5 months the previous headphone lasted.
Slightly Expensive.",4
451,Sound and Bass quality is awesome.,"Awesome sound and bass quality. Only one disadvantage in the product that the handset is somewhere loose. Overall it is quite good, if you're looking for study and listening song.
Boat always provide modern look, you don't have to worry about wire because it provide only one wire in the right side with 1m in length.",4
452,"Good buy,value for money but sound quality is not the best",It's my second purchase of the same product. The fist was two years ago. The sound was awesome... This time the sound quality doesn't match the first purchase.,3
453,Ok for daily use.,"Use for online interactions. Tried for music as well. Sound quality on the good. However have bose earphones too, so nothing compared to that kind of sound quality. Ok for daily use.",3
454,boAT Bassheads 900 - Amazing Headphones,"Amazing headphones. Sound quality is very good when you are watching movie or listening song. Bass is impressive.

455,"Its got mostly everything like Noise canceling , hard bass , good sound its can be use for gaming",The product is good and the sound quality and the bass just awesome But headphones are quite tight its a good thing because if its not tight its will fall off and noise canceling will not work well . But after sometimes its started pain in my ears but I think it will lose after some. Overall its worth it for its price. (I got it in 70% off price so for me its totally worth it),4
456,Value for money,"Good product, definitely a good deal to gun for. Just the cushioning would have been better as it develops ear pain while using it for a longer duration. Rest the packaging can be improved by providing the case. Hopefully the product should be a good one.",4
457,"Good quality, built and sound, super wire quality too.","Good sound quality, excellent wire quality and good built quality, cord connector is of metal so no twist and damage to it is possible.

The paint of one side of the headset was falling apart after a week while the other side showed no such problems. Overall the pdct is good.",4
463,Beautiful sound quality for it's price.,"I bought this about 6 months ago. The sound quality exceeds expectations at this price, I bought it for Rs.699 on offer. The bass is great, the build quality is pretty good, it's very light weight and foldable. I like the mic placement it's very close to the headphones so you don't have to lift it up to your mouth when you use it, mic quality could be better. It's slightly painful on the ear with prolonged use of more than one or two hours, but that's my complaint with most on ear headphones. Overall great product for it's price.",5
464,Expectedly Unexpected,Boat provides us with the best products at a reasonable rate. I bought them just for my evening walks but now i think I'm gonna switch to them. Only flaw is that the cushions are not much comfortable. I was confused between these and Skullcandy anti headphones. But i ended up buying them because of the microphone. I don't think this isn't worth it.,4
465,Damaged product received,"Received a damaged product.
I have rated this product 1 star because 0 is not available.😡😡😡

I recommend this product for those people who want high quality bass & sound headphones in cheaper price.",5
468,Microphone stopped ; but sound amazing,At first I thought it was so good and would at least come for a year but after 10 days ; the microphone stopped working. Now that I can't return it I am using it to listen music or watch YouTube but the sound quality is amazing,1

471,BoAt products are worst.,"Lower and poor quality, I have wastet Rs 3,000 on 4 BoAt products. All of them stop working before warranty period.
There is no after sale service. Once its stop , It Stop....

Dont buy . Its Chinese product worst product and waste of money",1
472,Sound leakage outside and Mic quality is bad,"Bass is not quality rather just over bust, sound leaks out not good in silent places where outsiders can hear what you are listening. Also not good for calling as mic quality is very bad and unusable.",2
473,Didn't expected robust and sturdy quality in this price range,"Build quality is Good, Sony was my choice before purchasing Boat, however i'm satisfied with the product. It hurts your ears for sure, if you've big head please ignore this for purchase. I've got headache after listening to songs in high volumes. Overall good product, as the model was introduced in 2017 cant expect up-to date features.",3
474,Good headset in low price,"Intial impression:Sound quality is good
As these are on ear headphones,the company should focus on improving the quality of cushion on these next generation headphones as they are hurting the ears
After 1 year usage: replaced product after 7 months and boat sent me a brand new one as the jack stopped to work in the previous one. Replace unit worked well for 5 months after that headset started to breaking...
Finally...
Sound quality-good
Built quality-bad
Value for money-yes
If you're a normal user and want to buy a on ear headset in budget than go for it",4
475,substandard plastic and materials are used,"I purchased this headphone in july 2019 although sound quality is good but were local materials are used ,it started wearing and plastic parts ( very local quality) started to break even in regular use , it was so disappointing experience for me that how such a quality brand is so ignoring of materials , and i found here no option to replace it even My produ t is in warrenty period.",2
476,Best Headphone In This Price.,This is my 1 year experience with this headphone. I didn't face any issue in 1 year. All things are working properly. It is the best headphone offers in very low price with great sound quality. It has supper extra bass and in-line mic. It is a foldable headphone. It's cushion is soft. Headphone vibrates at high bass sound. Ear pains after using for long time.,5
477,bOAt basshead 900 Head Phone Pains Ear Lobble,After wearing 1 hr or more there is pain in ear lobble. It means it's ear cushions are poor so overall product rating poor. Only 7-days review time is very less ...probably they know the issues so review time placed very less.,1
478,Worst headphone for meetings,"Noise cancellation is the worst
Also the headphone wont work everytime unless you rotate the pin/plug.
Bass and sound is good but it doesnt matter as the noise cancellation is worst.",1
479,Good,Second time I got this. Last time it lasted for more than a year and that too it broke coz of mishandling by my son. Sound quality is very good. In fact I have ordered 3 of this,5
480,It is good if you use only to listen to music or voice,"I feel this product is OK if you use it for just listening. The mic quality is poor, I got issues in many calls that I had attended. Other side of people complained about my voice being very low. Otherwise this is a good product, bass is also OK. I liked its light weight.",3
481,Good product and value for money,This is an awesome product. Sound quality and bass quality is good. I continuously using this one without any issues for 3-4 hours in a day. Noise cancellation is not there but with this price we cant expect that. Anyway,5
482,Light and small,"The first thing that strikes you is how light this product is, very impressive. The sound quality is good considering it's price, but you get what you have paid for. The only drawback I see, is the size of the earphone loves, it is small even for someone who has tiny earlobes like me. With time it kind of irritates due to the pressure it puts on your ears, especially if you wear specs",3
483,Mic is not working after a month,"My headset purchased 1 month back and now mic is not working (only audio working). Support number is not operational and it shows company it self as low standard. To visit service center, it may cost more than product price..very disappointed.. pathetic quality.",1
484,It's not a bad one,"I bought this one for my online studies,and i am satisfied with its performance . It's a good product in this money range. But noise cancellation is very bad,worst experience from notice cancellation. One who near to us can also hear the sound . The quality is very good . I am writing this after using it for last 5 mouths.",4

I had ordered at 799 and next day it was 749 , cancelled old and purchased at 749.",4
488,Basshead.,"These headphones have good bass and sound quality at lower to medium volume.
The treble is decent; the vocals are understandable. A point to note though is, these headphones may get uncomfortable during extended use.
Casual listening to songs with heavy bass is what these headphones are made for.",3
489,Boat headphone 900 is better,"No complaint about build quality 5/5 , wire and headphone jack.... Sound quality is better , but main problem is pain its tight and pain is so much ...sound , mic quality is better like 200 ruppes headphone, but yahh bass quality is best , Anyone doesn't use more than about 2 hours it causes pain to ear
Finally , please Improve sounds quality and please fix the pain issue",3

This is not ANC product.
For day to day voice calling and music",5
492,Worth it.,"Bought it in Amazon Navratri sale at 699! This is the best thing in this price range. A Budget headphone like this should have two quality, sound and comfort, and it has both of them. Looks good too!! One thing, a wider over the head band would look even more beautiful but anyways, it does the job.
Note: Buy only from trusted seller like Appario or cloudtail.",4

496,Poor quality.. Don't buy,One of the speakers stopped working in exactly 2 weeks. No visible damage anywhere on the product. It is a defective product.,1
497,Best one in audio,"Well i have purchased so many Bluetooth headsets ( rs1200-3000) but they can't perform like this truly,sound quality is awesome on the mark and bass is also good if u r not like bass u can manage from phone generally, but if u love music no doubt go for it built quality is also fentastic .I am sure no one will disappoint .",5
498,Nice headphones,"Sound quality of this product is good and it has a nice bass audio quality, but 1 thing I don't like about this product is that it stops working on one side after a period of 6 month of purchasing this headphones, though there is a warranty card attached with this product which is for a period of 1 year and still there is no repair service is available.",3
499,Hold on just read my review once....,The built quality is awesome I don't know how many times i was scarred that i screwed with the wire but noo the headphones are super strong and flexible Music quality is also good but if u sit in an library and want to listen to hard rock or hip hop or any loud music the music will be heared by the whole library so that's one drawback,5
500,Just under 3 weeks time it stopped working,"just like any other cheap china product just under 3 weeks time it stopped working

difference to other products is boAt has made In India label and ADs",1
501,Not much quality,"Six months of usage. Never dropped it once. Despite all the care it broke. The design was too tight, caused ear pain. Sound quality was good but due to flawed design unable to use for longer period.",2
502,Bad build design,"The point connecting to ear piece is thin and narrow ,if u see other brands it is broad and strong, so it will break after continuous use. Too much of bass. Not suitable for high pitch songs. Build quality plastic is weak. Product broke within an year after continuous usage.",1
503,waste of money !,"I previously used Sony headphone which i bought 7 year ago for Rs.1290 so when i listen to this boat product, i notice the quality difference. Sound is not rich and clear like Sony & Base is too much which is not necessary we can adjust it with graphic equilizer. also you can not wear this for more than half an hour because ears starting to hurt.",2
504,This product is not suggested for rugged use.,"Quality of cable is very Poor quality as it wear out very quickly and cracks were seen on it not even a month since I have purchased it.
It's above the ear mechanism at right ear swivel cup is broken very quickly.",1

509,Good quality,I liked the sound quality and the noise cancellation very much but there is just one problem that my ears hurt after Wear in for even 10 minutes. It is not that it is tight but I don't know why but my ears hurts. And other specifications are very good.,4
510,Best of best till now.,"Almost 3 years ago bought this, and still using as it is jus little bit of cushioning leather getting torn, else all good.

514,Take care of the price!,"This is a wonderful wired headphones however make sure you buy it around the range of 600-750.. because if you are buying it of around 1K by any chance, you can in stead get a wireless one!
But yes if you are buying a WIRED ONE - THIS IS AMAZING!",5
515,Worst experience,"No issue with the product itself. I have issue with the service. I returned the product and asked for replacement because there was some rattling sound coming from mic. The took the product but never a replacement. I dropped mails after mails but no response. Now writing review after 7 months, still did not receive the replacement.",1
516,Great Budget Headphones,"I bought these headphones just for secondary usage. I hadn't any much expectations from them..
But boy do these headphones surprised me.
The sound quality is very great in the price segment and the bass is just awesome.
Just go for it if you can't go for higher segment. You won't regret it.

PS- The build quality is good too, but don't expect to smash em and be able tl use them again.",5
517,NOT SATISFACTORY IN MY SET,SORRY TO SAY SOUND QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD IN MY SET. NOISE DISTURBANCE IS THERE IN MY SET. MAY BE GOOD FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS. MY SET IS NOT GOOD . WHILE SINGING ONE CANNOT CONCENTRATE DUE TO NOISE DISTURBANCE. THANKS,2
518,Poor build quality - 1yr use review,"Very poor quality. Didn't last more than a year. Earpads started peeling, wire snapped at plugin.
Overall sound quality is good but build quality is extremely poor. Unless you want to by new headphone every year.",2
519,Honest review,Superb product and honestly i didn't find any sound quality difference in higher brands like sony and the sound quality is same as sony headset and also the cable is long enough and i bought white colour which is a pure white and cables are broad which may last for long time,5
520,Sexy,If you want to play pub g mobile it's not for that because it crates a sound that disturbs other friends on other side otherwise its just awesome sound ans bass are awesome and it's sound leak proof as well you can't hear anything outside after wearing this,5
521,PLEASE DON'T BUY. Honest review with pros and cons,Extremely uncomfortable on the ears. Please don't buy. There's no return option. Only replacement with the exact same item. Sound quality and noise cancellation is really good but cannot be worn for more than 15 minutes without extreme pain in the upper ears.,1
522,Best headphone with bass and good service.,"Writing this review after 10 months, Awesome bass effect and the quality of headphone is really good, after 10 months one side speaker was gone and I claimed for warranty and they replaced with the new one. Best service by boat really happy with the service and product.",5
523,Don't believe me try to get this product,"One of the good better best experience with Amazon .most beautiful is the packaging.It is very secure packaging.I can't believe it,the bass is awesome.noise cancelation button is up to mark.just go for it.But as u Know every product has some disadvantage so,after turning full volume it starts vibrating but good experience,even writing this review I am listening badtameez Dil in it",5
524,PAISA VASOOL QUALITY...,"Sounds great,bass great,noise cancellation great,BUILD QUALITY good......After using it very roughly for 11 months,its 1 speaker went off after 2 month the headphones broke.....BUT FULL PAISA VASOOL QUALITY..it gives you what it promises,Believe Me i have extremely used it roughly but it has survived for much longer time than I thought..Hatss off to the manufacturers...Now I m thinking of buying rockerz 400....",5
525,"VFM but is it a new, original package?","Pros
1. 5 feet cable
2. The 3.5 mm connector has a metal grip.
3. Decent bass though the trebles are a bit subdued.
CONS.
The package was all open. No signs of any of the manufacturer's sealed package.
Or is this a renewed product?",4
526,Must read,"The worst product ever!
Though it's sound quality is good , it's a waste of money as we can't keep it on our ears for more than few minutes. It causes a lot of ear pain and headache",1
527,Worth the purchase without pinching your pocket,"Best product with the lowest price. Exceptional sound quality with noise cancellation and excellent bass. Initially, I was reluctant to place the order. However, it surpassed my expectations.",5
528,Superb in this range,"Today my headphones have completed one year. I have noticed two problems-
1) the wire near the 3.5mm pin is covered by a metal spring which has rusted and the earcups which are also metal but the areas were the paint has chipped off rust has come
2) this is not that relevant in starting the headphone was tight due to which it cannot be used for long time but after continuous use it will become more and more comfortable
Rest the sound quality is epic the bass quality is superb .",5
529,very good sound quality with deep bass,"its a very good headphone,bass is extra ordinary,try it with bass boasted songs,its deep! sounds like you heard it from a 1000w subwoofer system.noise cancellation is good.the wire and connection joints are perfect.

however the mic isnt that perfect but managable.

for music,movies its really good",5
530,Good headphones. Go for it!,Noice cancellation is good. Comfortable to wear. The bass is not as much as was expected. It is alike most earphones. Mike is good. The accept/reject/pause/play button responds few microseconds late. But within 1000 bucks this is a great product.,4
531,Tight over the ears and head ache starts in 10mts,"The kind of review I have seen in Amazon, I thought it will be a nice one to use. Sorry to say that , my daughter used it and with in 10mts of usage she got headache. I will always go with my favorite Sony brand in future.
Manufactures needs to ensure the headsets over the ears cannot be this much tight and cannot make head ache with in 10mts of usage. Very bad and sad.",1
532,Fits good but feels discomfort.,The headphone gives a awesome output of sound quality and bass is decent for this price. The build quality is quite decent. However it feels some sort of discomfort on ears after about half an hour of usage. But the quality is ok. the length and the quality of the wire is also good. The headphone is ultimately worth for the amount u pay.,4
533,Pocket's best friend,"Incredibly awesome ❣️ This quality is just OP for a under budget person feel proud to buy this

The only minute problem is that it pains your ears a little after use of 45 minutes of continuous and I don't find this reason appropriable for not giving it 5 stars because it's other features have nullify this con",5
534,Ok ok type.... For this price,Its ok for a full star but in my previous experience with other headset i am not fully satisfied with its performance. And you use continuously for a long time it gives you enough pain because it's tightly sit on your ears..,4
535,Average,"Like the description says, the bass quality is very good but the headphones do not sit comfortably on your ears. Makes it uncomfortable and there is absolutely NO noise cancellation.",3
536,You are gonna regret after buying these.,"I don't know why many people are giving it five stars or telling other people that it's good.
Seriously believe me this is my honest review.
1) very low bass
2) alot of music sound comes out, feels like you are playing song on a speaker.
3) built quality is so cheap.
4) microphone is quite good.",1
537,Uncomfortable O-Cup | Great durability and Sound,"The O type cup though well padded do gives some pain as it presses the upper crus towards the head. An oval cup is suggested (Though oval cup will require high investment)

Otherwise as per price point this is good !!",4
538,Love it❤,"I really like it.....actually I love this headphones ❤❤❤.Sound quality is very good, bass is very good.Actually worth it.",5
539,Nice purchase.,Definitely exceeded my expectations. Good product under 1K. Been using it for 18 months now. Bass is very good for the price range. Max volume is quite loud too. Overall another nice product from Boat. Gotta give them credit for increasing competition.,4
540,Nice sound but..,Sound with awesome bass but the comfortability lacks a bit. We can't use for a long duration as the the spring compression between the ears are a bit to hard and it hurts after certain point like or maybe after 45 minutes of continues use. Overall it's good.,4
541,Amazing Sound Quality,"Very good sound quality, perfect for long use, nice sound cancellation & amazing bass effect, its come with attached mic its plus point. very happy with sound quality.",5
542,Stopped working within 14 days.,"Pls don’t go for this, one side of the headphones stopped working within 14 days and not sure if it can be exchanged or returned. Waste if money! We only used it for online studies.",1
543,It deserves 5 starts but I am giving 4 just because,"Everything in this headset is alright whether it's sound quality,bass quality, built quality,etc...just one thing that's not good is that, it's a bit sharp, not the ear(cushion) part but the plastic part...you can't wear it around your neck for too long because of the sharpness of its plastic that goes around your neck when you wear it on your neck... rather than this everything else of this headset is recommended to anyone who what's value for money...👍",4
544,Overall just ok no big deal!!,I like the build quality it is good. But in the case of sound quality the vocals aee good but bass is very low compared to Boat 400 series overall just ok. The headset is not too tight so its easy to wear for long hours.,3
545,Doesnt last,"I bought boAt BassHeads 900 On-Ear Wired Headphone in Dec 2018, these only lasted till March 2020, with internal wiring issues and the ear-pads crumbling.",1

Overall quality is best according to the price of the product",4
549,Not as expected,Its not as per my expectation and my ears started paining after using this for 1 hr.. Really heavy and not good to use..,2
550,Boat headphone with mic is excellent in quality,"Full HD Sound quality is excellent, Bass is excellent, HD mic quality is morethan excellent ,noise cancellation is too good, looks too good ,it's pearl white in colour.
I acknowledge it's quality.",5
551,Good quality product in reasonable price.,"Nice sound quality and range. Quite comfortable, affordable on price. Could be more comfortable if size of ear sets can be increased in diameter. If you keep it on for long duration it starts to uncomfort you ear muscles. Overall pretty good.",4
552,BUY WITHOUT A DOUBT,"SO HERE IS A FULL REVIEW OF THE PRODUCT HOPE IT MIGHT HELP YOU.....
THE FIRST THINK IS

BASS...... IT'S THAT MUCH YOU EXPECT BY SEEING IT'S NAME AS BASS HEAD IT IS OK YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED...

553,Amazing product,"Amazing product from boAt, lite weight and simple design, awesome quality durable plastic great fit for the ears.
After 2 years of usage the cable is broken in to two peaces so that's it I think after 2 years the life span of cable start losing its function to hold the entire thing a part.",5
554,Just go for it.,"Fabulous product at a great price. The sound and bass qualities of the headphone are simply superb. Though it lags a little in case of noise cancellation, it is just OK in this respect only. Worth buying every penny.",5
555,Awesome product 🔥🔥🔥,"Although, delivery was late,but it was over covered by the quality and experience of using it 😎😎.
I loved it very much bass is superb,noise cancellation is also good, firstly it is a bit tight on the ears but later it is fine,pubg experience is superb all footsteps are clearly heard.🔥🔥🤘🤘 Best for everything 😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥",5
556,Worst customer support.,"I order this headphone 🎧 and within 6 day, the right ear stop5 working.
Then I went customer service center and got another. The new one was also is not working.
They don't reply on emails.
It's the worst product I ever got.",1
557,It used to be great,"I bought this headset 3 years and still working fine. Recently my brother needed a headset, so I bought the same model to him.
Everything is up to the mark except on thing, the sound quality feels little bassy and flat.
The old headset which I'm sound better than the new one.
Other than this is a great headset.",4
558,Complete waste of money and bad product,The product is not working and gives a very disturbing sound.. don't buy it.. complete. Waste of money.. i bought it to gift someone and it was a complete embarrassing moment for me when my friend complaint about it.. would never buy it.. it stopped working since last 2 months.. i bought it in January 2019,1

560,faulty,"After month, this g=headphone start giving problem.
It automatically change volume settings, this happen with Phone as well as PC :(",1
561,BEST HEADPHONE under Rs.1000/-,Overall the product is very good. It is probably the best headphone at this price. The sound quality and build quality along with the built-in-mic are all fabulous. But the sound upper range is only 16000Hz against their claimed upper range of 20000Hz. Else arre all good. Even at high volume there is no shatter of sound...it remains clear with high bass.,4
562,Superb headset,"I loved the product. It's really awesome. I love to listen through this headset. I thoroughly enjoy every individual instrument sounds through this.

One negative point I noticed is - boat could have used bit better material. In future, there may be chance of breaking.",5
563,"Great sound quality, but not as comfortable!","The sound quality is great! But these headphones are not as comfortable as you can imagine. I had a pair of JBL headphones for 2500; Compared to those, these almost make my ears pain. It's not a perfect fit, because there's a little gap just below the ear. Elaborating on the sound quality, the bass and treble is just perfect!",3
564,GOOD ONE,NICE ONE.. but the sound becoming an alert for others by sitting near by me.. Thats the main problem.. Rest of these its a good one.. For its prize we should try this.. No problm..,4
565,Buy it .,Have been using it for a month . I have been using it intensly to listen to music and lectures online . It's very reliable . Very comfortable . Great value for money . Will keep buying this brand in future also.,5
566,Satisfied as per price,"So far so good, the sound quality is good,
Feels comfortable when we use for long time,
I generally use it for daily meetings and session of online, the con is only one that it captures all voice clearly but along with it, it also captures ambient noise and low pitch voice.",4
567,Get rid what other are saying.. 😅,This a very good product... And really appreciatable as it meets all my expectation... Sound quality is extremely good.. Base also... And if you use it you will not notice what other are saying. 🤓,5
568,Worth product as per price,"I bought this boat 900 headphone the sound quality and bass quality is awesome but one thing is that about noise cancellation is little bit less but overall as per the price this product is worth.
And the material quality of headphone is good light weight about headphone jack that is also premium quality, wire quality also good i mean overall this headphone is good.",5
569,Comfortability varies from person to person,"For me the headphone clamping force is perfect, I so many people are complaining about the high clamping force. For me it's perfect. Sound quality is really good. Really good bass, the bass will not hurt your ears. Wire equality is also really good, I got it in a sale for 599 rupees. Best in that price range",5
570,Good product for 2 months.,"Like the sound quality and built quality. But it worked for 2 months only. Microphone stopped working and volumes fluctuating automatically.

Product price is reasonable but 2 months validity for that price is way too expensive.",1
571,Massive Bass,"Fantastic headphones for 750 bucks. Beats JBL phones costing 2000 plus cause I have both. Solid bass, good Hi frequencies and acceptable mid range. Best in this and higher price range. Great build quality and aesthetically superb. Must buy.",5
572,Sound quality is very nice,"I like very much this product and buy 5 times and also refer to my some friends and they buy it.
It's very good quality with sound and bass in this range.
I had used two headphones in this range Sony and Philips but use the first time this no need to see any other brand headphones in this range.",5
573,"Even in 50% volume , sound willeak","I want to give 4 stars for its bass but
The major problem is the sound is leaking out .even if there is 50% volume the sound leaks out.
So others can hear what we are hearing.
If u want Privacy .then dont buy this product .i am really disappointed for this.
This is my first review.
I want you guys to know about this issue .",2
574,Its just ok ok,Not that great head phone. It is just an ok ok with the price point. Doesn't fit on the head properly. Noise cancellation is not that great.,3

579,"Nice headset, poor mike","The only issue with the headset is that, it's microphone (Mike) is far away and it's audio hole is located in the opposite direction, making it very hard for the person to hear our voice when we speak.
Apart from that, it is the best.",3
580,"Nice Bass Quality, dont overuse for long hrs","Bass Quality is good and nice to take calls on both smartphone and laptop, incase someone ears are sensitive it is recommended to listen in low volume as hearing with high volume may cause irritation also end up with headache.",4
581,Good product in reasonable price.,"Changing review 1star to 4 star now. Ears were hurting but when I read reviews, I also applied that and put a book between headphone for 2 days and now it is ok.",4
582,Good but not the best.,"The Headphones are good, with great sound quality but very uncomfortable. Head starts paining after longer use. The noise cancellation is almost zero, you can even hear far away noises clearly.
Overall good for general purpose use but won't recommend for meets or office use.",4

Really it sounds nice ....haha..
Audio is very good. Specially it's for bass lovers.
I purchased boAt Headphone for the second time after satisfaction of boAt product (boAt 225 earphone )for 1 year.
The wire is about 2 meter and quality of wire is good. Good thing is that ,wire is only one side of the headphone speaker.",4
585,THE BEAST!!!!!!,"No other headphones can beat this either in terms of bass or in terms of sound quality even headphones for price range of 18 to 20k is not worth like this, I'm really satisfied with all the performance of this specially specially for bass really awesome product....",5

For pubg players this headphone is good, foots comes clearly. Mic is also fine can talk easily.",4
587,Value for money.,"Sound quality is great and the bass is decent. But the noise cancellation is not good, if you play a song at high volume then the people around you can hear the song as well. I got it for 598 INR in GIF sale. So I think nothing else I can say.",5
588,Cheap and best,"Sound quality is nice, clear and crisp. Noise cancellation is good when indoors and works well if on high volume outdoors. A good pair for gaming on mobile devices, it's the best you can get cheaply, feels good while gaming just the pads aren't that comfortable, upper part of ears starts hurting a bit after 3 to 4 hours of Continuous usage.",4

That's why I decided to return it back.",4

596,Very good headpone with Poor Noise cancellation,"Amazing sound quality. with betterclarity...

One big problem is Noise cancellation during call. Receiver will hear noise whenever microphone is moving.
Need to hold and speak for better clarity.

Hopefully designers see it and correct the same..",3
597,Good one,Decent headphones for the price. I’ve used it for calls and listening to audio without any noticeable discomfort. Noise cancellation is decent.,5

599,Best in Rs.799 price range,"I have purchased this after a week long research. I wanted something less costly but comfortable. Probably best headset in Rs. 799 range. This has mic also. Do not compare it with JBL T450 or T500 which will cost Rs. 1900+. Sound quality is great but little harsh at full sound. Bass is great. Truly value for money. Build quality and durability at par with JBL.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase",4
600,It work for 2 year really good product and long lasting.,"After 2 year of use today its one side is not working, its awsome product, i really happy with this product. Quilaty of material are really good and long lasting.
Now i am looking for new earphones but this time also only boat brand , i trusted on boat brand.",5
601,Headphones stopped working within 2 months,"When I bought it, I was quite satisfied with it for a month or two after that the left side started giving distorted audio. Then the left side stopped working. Same happened with the right side & return window was closed within 7 days of the purchase. So, my money is wasted . DO NOT BUY!!",1
602,Amazing product,I have been using these regularly for almost a year now for my online classes(almost for 10 hrs daily) it's amazing especially the price range it comes in the only defect I find now after such a long use that the wire is now getting a bit worn out ....... it's a must option specially for regular users,5
603,Good product,"Good product, and good design, serving good sound quality. Material is also good. Only defeated I found is the ear piece could be little more big, which can give more comfort for long time usage",4
604,"Under Warranty, not Working already",I bought it in July and now in Feb it stopped working when I checked for Warranty they ask me to come to Service Center to get it repaired. Not the kind of service a customer expects,1
605,Good One,"Very good sound clarity.
Light weight.
I give 4 star because of its wire.
It's not moveable.",4
606,Good Sound but Not for calling,"Just got these headphones, the sound is awesome but I am not a heavy listener. Brought this for office calls but there is NO NOISE CANCELLATION, You can hear Fan voice and other disturbance. The wire is too long. But ultimately not good for calling, so my rating will be 3/5. Got it for Rs 799.",3
607,Good Sound and looking,"The product is very good sound and elegant in design, the only drawback is the size is small due to ear get pain..",3
608,Lacks clarity,"The main thing,the sound, is not that good, I mean it lacks clarity. Build quality is okay but a cx 180 sounds waaayyyyy better than this one which is I still use as my primary headphone/earphone.

Update: You get used to it and it's okay if you are paying 599 for it. I mean wire looks sturdy and the headphone is comfy as well. I'm still not satusfied with the sound but good product if you consider the price and the build.",4
609,Good in all respect.,"The product is very good. The first one somehow became out of service after use of five months of its purchase. As and when reported to the company, promptly and hasslefreely they replaced it by a fresh one. Thanks to them. I am happy with the product and more happy with their after sale service. This is a sweet experience in my life.",4
610,Good Product,"This is Good Headphone as it have good Mic, Sound Clearity......I use it for Office Work and Listening Music, Movies......It is great specially for WFH Peoples now a days for Attending Online Meetings, Kids Classes",4
611,If you have the money go for something else,If you are smart you wont buy this and please dont listen to your friends that this is a good headphone... Believe me its not... It does not connect well with a few device and the slightest touch on the jack will disturb the audio.,2
612,ACE OF BASS,"Well! when it comes to bass, the boat bass heads are one of a kind headphones delivering thumping bass.
It gives all the kind of deep bass, bass drop which a bass lover definitely likes.
Also it provides a good quality of noise cancellation which quite effectively isolates you from your surroundings and submerges you in the world of music.",5
613,Nice headphones for fun,"I used it on a daily basis while cycling. The great sound quality in such a budget, sometime BASS lack on high volume, but I manage by reducing the volume a bit. Well, it's also risky to listen at such a high volume with huge bass.",5
614,Sound quality is not good doesn't support Casio keyboard CTK 7300IN,"This item is not supporting to Casio keyboard CTK7300IN actually I bought it for said keyboard.
But previously I bought the cordless Bluetooth headphones which support the same with good quality sound.",1
615,A quality product to listen music with DOLBY DIGITAL BASS AND SURROUNDING SOUND QUALITY.,I USE THIS PRODUCT FOR LISTING MUSIC AND FEEL A AWESOME AUDIO QUALITY WITH HIGH AND DOLBY DIGITAL BASS AND SURROUNDING SOUND QUALITY. I JUST LOVED IT.,5
616,Not for the person with large Ears and though sounds good,"Not up to the mark, the ear cuff is very small. We can't use it more than one hour.. It pains.. But it sounds good for the price and bass is empty...",3
617,Awesome product,"This product is awesome, i use this product on dailbasis ,while travelling in a metro , it is easy to use and the sound quality is awesome,but 1 should know that the bass is heavy too, I m a basa lover with sound quality , so this product is perfect for me",5
618,3/5,"The size of the product is too small, over all material quality is good but if they would made the cushioning some more it would have a good product, sound quality is not that much you can expect a standard sound , same as in the case of bass, you can not bare this up to 45 minutes continuously because of heat will generate inside the cushion.",3
619,Bloody bloody brilliant!,"These reached me in perfect packaged condition and the experience is way, way beyond the price I paid. I love these and would be swearing by BOAT for quite some time now. Kudos!",5
620,Ok,Bass is not upto the mark,4
621,#Awesome headphone!!! Boatheads!,"The headphone is just perfect really good just go for it and bass, sound quality very good just awesome",5
622,SIMPLY BEST,"Probably more than what u can ask for 600 bucks that too with a brand. Durability & material quality is top in it's class. Superb, just to say...Go for it without a second thought. Base is super boom.",5
623,Worst we can get..,This is a very bad product... Very sharp bass... Which is not comfortable for ears... And it does not has good quality sound.. And When I asked them for return they denied.. Please don't go for it... It is just waste of money.. They cheated me.. Please you peaple.. Please be aware of this product,1
624,NO BASS...ONLY NOISE,"Honest review.. I bought this headphone after reading the positive reviews of past buyers.
But when I used it for the 1st time, I was immediately disappointed. there was no BASS at all..
The sound was noisy, sharp and cracky, more like metalic sound.
I returned the item back to amazon.",1
625,Value for money,"The headset gives you a premium feel at this price point. The Music is sweet to ears, increase the volume and it start thumping :-). The chord does't tangle and the folding feature gives added advantage to keep it safe and in small places.. Recommenced buy",4
626,Instead go 4 another one.,"This was good headset when i bought it. It had good sound quality, good deep bass and was light weight. But after 6-7 months it stopped working. Left side of the headset stopped working. I don't recommend to buy this. Instead go 4 another headset.",1
627,Better but not comfortable over ears,The sound quality and all other are very good but I am feeling pain with my ears if I use it for long time. The cushion is not comfortable for the ears with this headset. I am writing this after using for 2 weeks.,3
628,"The best wired headset, value for money",This is the best wired headset I have ever used.Product is very useful and it is also a value for money product.High bass sterio type audio give me a super movie experience.,5
629,This boat wired headphone is also good.,"This boat wired headphone is also good. Amazing sound quality , in this price. Build quality is good . Headband is made of steel frame.very soft cushion is used to make this headphone. But it's bass quality is not good , no extra bass, but it's sound quality is creastal clear, instruments seperation is good. It's noise cancellation is not very good.",4
630,sound quality good BUT NOT RECOMMENDED For people with big heads!!! ^_^,really good sound quality! BUT using the headphones for more than 20 mins results in aching ears...its because the ear pads are not soft and headphones are tight!!! NOT recommended for people with bigger shaped heads !!,4
631,One of the worst headphones,The product is as per the price. Not reliable. The sound quality is poor. When a plug it in it automatically opens the music app in mac. It stops the video abruptly then it starts/stops/starts/stop/ even if there is light movement in the wire. Totally unusable. Same thing happens when plugged in mobile as well. It opens Google assistant automatically. Very hard to use and useless. Do not buy.,1
632,This is a very good Headphone At a affordable Price!,"These headphones are awesome.. I'm writing this review after around 6 months and it is still awesome and in one piece.. I dropped it many times but nothing broke.. It's sound quality is very good, it's very comfortable and the ear cushions are Lso very soft... I will recommend u to buys this headphone.. 👍",5

Budget head phone.
Please ignore negative comments, recommend go for it. Just drawback is that volume control button is not available.",4
635,सोनी के हेडफ़ोन इनसे ज्यादा आराम दायक थे।,"इनको पहनने के बाद कानों में दर्द होने लगता है, आवाज भी घटिया है। इससे ज्यादा सही तो सोनी के 650 वाले हेडफ़ोन थे, आवज कुछ दिनों में धीमी हो गयी थी लेकिन कानों में दर्द तो नही होता था।",1
636,A big no.,"It's very difficult to carry around and the wire is too long. Sound quality is ok.
Update: Stopped working within a year. It was still in warranty so I contacted boat. I expected I'd be getting a replacement or at least the product would be repaired, but after 20 days of waiting, they gave me back the same headphones without even properly repairing. It stopped working again in a week.
DO NOT BUY.",3
637,Decent sound and build qyality.,"Sound quality is good and bass is also good at this price point , Seriously you cant expect anything more with this price range i got it for 599 and i am very happy with the product . Mic also working fine not an issue . Mostly i use these headphones with my office PC and i am totally satisfied with them. If you want a wired headphone with mic within 600-1000 rs then blindl go for this.",4
638,microphone noise and bass,"It's awesome. Good thing here is most of time in boat product the microphone are not good but the microphone of this good and clear voice catcher.
And about the noise cancellion is good.
But when the quality of sound is low or mobile signal is low while we calling than the noise is there.
The best highlights of this product is bass which it has. You may compare it with Sony headphones bass system.",5
639,Hmm meha maybe,I had jbl t500 ear phone was flaking off. So wanteds to change. Not as good. Not as comfy. But price point is good well tats wat u get for wat u pay,3
640,Mic not working after a year. I'm a regular user. Noise cancellation is awesome.,Became useless in 1.5 years. Mic is gone. Also it spoiled my phone jack. But I enjoyed in the beginning. Better go for philips or sony.,3
641,Can't use after 10 days as one side speaker wasn't working and broken wire on replacement unit,"Purchased this item in 22june2021. Within 10 days, one side of headphone was not working and sent for replacement. Received the replacement unit after a week. The received unit broken on the same day received. Spent Rs799, but can't use after 10 days. Very disappointed",1
642,"Cheap quality of ear pads, good sound quality","At this price point, you'd think there is a catch. And there is.

The pads have cheap covering on them that starts to wear off barely a few months into using it. The wire is surprisingly dirtphilic and looks awful after a few uses(especially if you buy the white variant which I had).",2
643,Uncomfortable for Ears,"Overall Average Product 🎧

Sound is Better but Not Comfortable ! Can't use more than 20 Minutes 🤐 Sustainable product ... Nice Look .... Good Audio Quality 👌",4
644,BOOM HEADPHONE,One of the best headphone for this price point. I like every-thing especially 3.5mm jack on it's wire. Every time my earphone broke from 3.5mm jack but it have a extra spring between on 3.5mm and wire.,5
645,Great quality headphones,"Great headphones at this price point. The sound is very good, bass is also good. The built quality of the headphones is also sturdy and looks premium.",5
646,Descent but ear cushion quality needs to be improved,This review is after 1.5 yrs of use. The product is of descent quality. Sound clarity as well as mic is descent. After 1.5 yrs of use the bad thing was ear cushions of the headset started to get tear. Probably it's not a good one to use in sweating condition.,3
647,Value for money,"Its is one of the most value for money product . It's sound quality is very good . Clear & deep bass with amazing noise cancellation . Very light in weight . But you can't use it more than 1 1/2 hour . The quality of the cord is also very good .But it's only cons is that BOAT does not give good service to their consumers , it means that if it is damaged within the warranty BOAT might not replace or repair the product .",5
648,"Overall good experience with punchy base,","Bass quality 8/10
Sound quality 7/10
Noise cancellation 5/10
Overall good experience but this on ear headphones very uncomfortable to start with, if budget is not an issue than try to go for over ear headphones for long time usage",4
649,Not comfortable,"Very normal headphone. You can buy more good quality headphones offline for same price.
Even with bluetooth. Sound is ok but they are not comfortable, you can't use than more than 30 minutes continuously.",3
650,Received used product,"RECEIVED USED PRODUCT..Whenever you send the product to customer, kindly send new product..Otherwise, you will loose your reputation and goodwill in the market..product was also not sealed packed...",1
651,Best product under 700rs but small.,Very nice product at this price. The sound quality and the bass is best. The only problem is that with very high bass. And the noise cancellation is not good. The ear cups are small. Otherwise the product is best at this range.,5
652,Not as expected,I think it is first copy kind of product. Sound quality and material isn't as expected. Little bit confused after purchase. So hard that cause earache in 10 min,1
653,Value for money,"• Sound quality - fine

• microphone - pretty okay
Overall this product is worth buying and satisfying for this price.
I am using these headphones for couple weeks now and I've had good experience overall.",4
654,Nice product,It's excellent headphones in this price range. The bass is very good. You can use it for games as well as videos and u will have no problem hearing any of the small sounds. It's a bit tight on your ears but that will loosen up after using it for a while.,4
655,Good value,"The earpieces can hurt a little after wearing for extended periods, like attending meetings.
The in-built mic is good, and the other party did not feel any difference from normal conversation w/o mic.",4
656,Decent buy,"Good product in this range.
Bass is amazing, sound quality is decent, noise cancellation is poor almost non existent as you can see these are not noise cancellation headphones.
Good buy.",4
657,Very Impressed,Using it every single day after i bought it. Totally impressed especially on the price - performance. The connector is metallic with a metallic extension which is good.,5
658,Noise disturbance,It's good for the price range it's being sold that is sub 1000 range ONLY except for the noise you get to hear along as disturbance faintly. I hope not all headphone has this issue but if you have than consider returning it,3
659,Worth Buying !!,"This is the headphone i was looking for a very long time. Fully satisfied when received.
Bought it on October 2018 and it is November now and yet faced no issues till.

I was really thinking a lot before buying it, but not I'm very much satisfied with it. Worth the money.",5
663,Value for Money,"Considering the price of the product ,
It gives full value of money spent. Do not expect more.",4
664,Spend Extra bucks and buy a good one,"Just because its cheaper , don't go for it .

The bass gives very dizzy disturbing noise. The Metal jack will give some shocks at times.

Noise cancellation is only because of its structure,over the ear, there is nothing more into it.

Design isn't well, sweats a lot at ears .

Plastic is very poor quality , just a little more strength to expand the headphones to keep on ears, the plastic breaks",1
665,Definetly go 4 it ...,"Used more than 2 years but it still feels the same , u m talking about sound quality ... the shiny black cover will pilled off after 1 year but it has nothing to do with sound quality and durability... Go 4 It...",5

Microphone either works or speakers. cannot use headphones for calling purpose. Your voice is not delivered to other end with this headphones. Now I don't have option for replacement or return.",2

670,No noice cancellation,Not noice cancellation at all. Good in quite enviornment. Quality is as oer saling price. Don't ve attracted by MRP and discounts. If you are paying 700 it is good.,1

677,Great Product in such low price. Must buy if you really looking for Headphones!!,My first song I played after putting the headphones was AANKH UTHI MOHHABAT ME..It was like closing my eyes and feeling the theatre seat and theatrical song even sitting at home in this Lockdown. Such great sound. Thanks to Amazon for faster delivery even in this pandemic.,5
678,Unsatisfactory performance and product,Found the headphones broken after delivery. Although the sound wasn't bad. But i found something shaky inside one of the earcups. And the headphone is very delicate and doesn't look too good as well,1
679,"Good Product, but has one disadvantage.","It is a very good product. It has good sound quality. It gives a decent gaming experience.
But it causes pain on the ear lobes if used continuously for hours because of the pressure caused by the steel used in it.
Overall it is worth buying if the disadvantage is neglected.",4

688,Just bass,"Music seems compressed and less quality when you listen thru it. It hass very poor high frequency response and a little bump in low mid frequencies that's why music sounds muffled and not clear sharp. Musical punch is also missing. The only thing i liked about it is, its built. Seems like it will work atleast one year.",3

Good for other systems. We are use in computer . Good sound.",4

In only 30days its wire got loose and could not able to connect with phone.
The sound quality is good but in only 30 days it is nt wrking",1
693,Excellent value for money: bass is high,"Quite solid build, what I particularly liked was the metal and springs around the jack. Normally this area goes bad very quickly, so a design that promotes long life in this throw away/disposable world is very welcome",5
694,Worst experience and fake product given,Product is not working properly.... mic is not working... replacement done but its not delivered to me and return to you... fake product delivered to me ..worst experience i ever had with amazon and you especially...,1

701,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G,"Really good headphones, perfect for video calls, music, and some gaming. You'll develop ear pain on the first day of use, but you'll adapt to it the next day. Good bass and nice clarity. I enjoy the bass. It's not noise-canceling, but still, does the job quite good. You can go for this if your budget is around 900.",5
702,Awesome experience,"I bought this deal for 700/- during great Indian sale. It truly changed the perspective of listening to music. It's mind blowing experience to listen music and watching movies. Guys just go for it, don't think u won't get this deal in this price.",5
703,"go fot it. great built quality, goob sound and premium material.",i got dis product for 600 and i was confused between jbl n dis n now no regrets at all. go for it guys and the built quality is very good n good bass aswell i strongly recommend this product n this is my honest review just buy this. ppl say it fits tightly but no it is not that tight but i feel its kind of loose fit. it would be nice if it was more tight n due to dat noise isolation is not that good. overall its a good deal grab them u'll surely love it.,5
704,"Worst product, 3 month life","Bought on 23 August, after about using it for 2 months and 2-3 weeks, it suddenly stopped working at all. Philips/Sony/
JBL are much better, durable and long lasting.",1
705,Mind blowing awesome headphones...,"I have been using boat headphone since one week and it is Very nice look & awesome and it's worth of money. Sound quality is very clearly. Also bass is a really good 👌 with that also hed a microphone which sounds very Good.
Wire is also long and quality is great. I love it.",5
706,build quality is not good.........,this headphone support all 3.5 audio jack. i faced an issue in this. After two month use I see that it's speaker back panel I found some rust I think It made from cheap quality iron material.,4
707,Bass Sound quality not that great 😒,"After using iphone headset may b the bass sound what i expect from specification was not upto mark , looks and cable safety holder is good .",3
708,Material quality not good,Don't buy. Stopped working after one year... Very low quality materials used. Very tight on ears. Can't wear it more than 5 minutes...,1
709,Value for money,Ordered this in January and it's been 5 months since the headphones are working very nicely. Have not faced any difficulties since then. The sound quality is just on par. Go for it as worth every penny!!,5
710,Good value for money,I bought these for recording songs and these serve the purpose just well. Excellent recording quality. The bass is also decent. Only con is that my ears start paining after about an hour of usage.,4
711,"Amazing sound quality, but headphones are comparatively small in size","The headphones have amazing sound quality, they are definitely worth the price.
The only drawback that I have been observing is the ear pad and the size.
It does not cover entire ear, since the size is comparatively small. You cannot use them continuously for a long time as your ear cartilage might start paining.",3
712,Bad product,Very bad product. The voice is altered and is not clear at all. Unable to take any meetings with this headphones as you wont understand what the other person is speaking. Complete waste of money.,1
713,Not for gamers and build quality.,If you are going to buy this headphone for your regular 2-3hours gaming then its not a great choice..this headphone is for listing music watching movies..if you keep the headphone at neck and work around then it hurts the nech it is the only issue with its build quality and its really light weight..sound quality is great and bass is Op..go for it if you are a casual user..,4
714,"Technically sound quality is up to the mark, But handling with care is important","Sound quality is good at this price range ,good extra bass, good noise cancellation, overall technically good
But handling with care is important, the foldable part is weak and 70 % chance for it will break in rough use , So handle with care",4
715,Disappointed:(,Didn't like it at all. Starting one month it was working fine but later suddenly stopped working and I couldn't repair it through online as well. Really a waste of money and I'm feeling very bad that I ordered this set thinking it would be great!,1
716,Nice quality but tight,"Nice build quality but very tight on ears... It starts hurting after 10 min of use.. if you can make them loose by some ""jugaad"" , then they will be perfect... But i do not recommend this to men.. They will be tight for you guys anyway",3
717,Totally Worth it!,"A good product, but doesn't cancel noise completely!! As a student i Enjoy my music thoroughly And Am happy to have bought this! Sometimes it starts sliding off my head but Quite compatible!",4
718,"Comfortable to wear, good clean sound",This is early days as bought it just during Diwali sale. So far there is nothing to complain about. I use it more for movies on laptop than for phone music.,4
719,Premium Bass quality,I'm using this product since past 3 month and I won't hesitate to say that this headset still Awesome and the Headset has Superb base and clear and loud vocals than a normal EARPHONE .... But i got a problem in my Right speaker which is lower bass than the Left one... Otherwise this is a best under 799/-,4
720,Not the best,U can use it for 1 year if you handle it well.. Cheap plastics and poor built ruined this product.. And it's also a lot bigger compare to other market products.. So I dont prefer this to anyone,2
721,Product is good,"Product is good, but packing condition was very poor, anyone can takeout and replace another,
For few things Amazon loosing customers.
Should be improve basic things like packing, .🤗",4
722,Good one for online classes,Good one for online classes. Very useful and good to use. But not that great for music. White is very good to look .,4
723,Awesome product for boAt,"Really its sound quality is very nice I really like this product this is the best in this price range and it's also provide very good frequency of bass I am using it from 1 week , really if you like bass like me you will really love it, if your frist choice is bass it you no need to think, just buy it",5
724,Buy Bindass...,Nice headphones. Quality of sound is fine. Material also good. Light weight as claimed. You can hang it on ears for couple of hours without any trouble. I am going to order black color also. If you are thinking to buy it just have it.,4
725,Boat bass-headphone .,"Nice basic headphones , not a great headphones with amezing sound but definitely a good headphones at this price . Built quality is good and decent of plastic, quite comfortable .you can wear them for 3 4 hours.",4
726,Earphone hardware quality,"I got one for my daily needs(work from home), it was working fine until yesterday. Today found the right side ear peice is lose and getting disengaged. Have requested for replacement/refund, let's see what it comes.",2
727,"Nice product, Value for the money.","Good product, nice sound and bass. lite in weight. Noise cancellation is average but when the music volume is max than you can barely hear something from outside. The hardware quality of this product is okay (not awesome). But in this price this quality is good.",4
728,Value for money,Worth the money. It does put quite a bit of pressure on the ears. So it hurts if you use it for long periods of time. The sound quality is good.,4
729,With more bass and clear sound,"Nice headset. Suggest to buy.
If WFH and want to take calls, think twice, as Bass will be more..otherwise fantastic for music lovers who love high volume..",5
730,Bad choice,So I had bought the same exact thing from Myntra a year back the same model same color but I truly believe that then old one is better that's why I thought of buying the same thing but this new one is just no good the mic is way too different the sound quality is poor sad..... Money wasted.,1
731,Not comfortable on my ear,"Not at all comfortable gives me pain when i use this

everything else is good",2
732,Sound Ok but Mic Is Bad,"The sound output is acceptable.
However mic is not good. Receivers complaint lot of noise.
The headphone feel tighter after 30 min so not for long use.
It just solve purpose for a while",3
733,Good headphone but would be better,If vocals would be more clear than it would be a perfect product. Nice bass Overall its a nice product. After 4 days use it is not comfortable with ears It will give you headache after 30 min use,3
734,Value for Money,One of the best headphones for this rate. Full Value for money. Foldable also which makes storage/packing easy. Soft cushion in the ear piece.,5
735,Value for money headphones,I bought this Boat Bassheads headphone last month and it certainly did not disappoint me with its performance. The noise cancellation is very good and the sound quality is also good for its price range. This a value for money product and recommend this product.,4
736,Fabulous product!!,"I'm very satisfied with this product. It fits comfortably, the sound quality is exquisite for this price range. Definitely worth buying, thanks to Amazon for highlighting this headphone in the suggestion pane. Cheers!!",4
737,Does the job,"I am not expecting it to be a great device, I bought it for my child to attend online classes. Good, but bit heavy on the head.",4
738,No warranty provided,Worst thing is the headphones are very tight on ears which can cause severe pain to the ears...after use of 3 months it has been dead and no warranty or help is provided from the company,3
739,Amazing headphones,Sounds wise great but are a little bulky on the year. The cord is really long so that's really a relief esp. for laptop.,5
740,#Quality not good but sound 👌,"It's sound is very good But its parts become very loose in 4days only.If it broken we cant repair it anywhere so Be carefull while using and think once before buying.By suggestion is to buy Bluetooth headset not this wired. Not satisfied by this product because not as much as expected quality.so I returned it.
To handle this we have to take more care on it.",2
741,Very good purchase experience!,"True to boats' reputation. My entire family is all vying with each other to use it. 😁 Hence, planning on buying another one",5
742,Needs to improve the quality,"Though the sound quality is best it's the comfort that kills the product review...
It irritates if use for more than 1 hr...
And eventually cushion will fade it will start hurting you ear even more",3
743,awesome product from BOAT ...Must buy friends,"Awesome product from BOAT at this low price
Good bass and fine sound quality
Also noise cancellation is great.
Compatible and good design
Enjoys using it.
Must recommend you to buy it.",5
744,Do not buy. Worthless,"Pathetic product. Do not go by the 5 stars ratings. This headphone is not durable at all. In 3 months the 3rd class plastic body comes falling lose. A lot of distortion while making or receiving calls. A gloated bass sound.

Not at all worth buying this one.

A big thumbs down.",1
745,Awesome bass headphones,"Best bass headphones money could buy. Boats always are on top of this, they always manufacturs the best product. Great bass, doesn't hurt you ear and use it only for 2-3 hours or your ears will get sweaty",5
746,Not a Comfortable headset,"Person will not be comfortably wear headset more than 30 mins. It will create pain in Ear area.

Not good for Music lovers and work from meeting, because main drawback it's not comfortable.

Note: Sound quality is good. Mic also working fine till now.",3
747,Satisfied,"I rarely give reviews ,, and. I always have second thoughts to buy anything from any online store . I don't usually go for online purchase , since I have lost much of my money buying defect products and have challenges in getting refund.

This product is totally worth the money. Sound quality is awesome , and totally satisfied",5
748,Poor quality headphones,Poor quality headphones... specially comfort wise. Your ears will start paining with 5 mins of use. I would plz don’t fall for good look and reviews. I don’t think so many positive reviews are genuine. There is issue with return policy.,1
749,Amazing Clarity and Bass,Probably the best ones in this range. Never enjoyed music as much as I do using these. Beware that you will not like any other equipments once you start using these.,5
750,Pooring wiring quality,Generally good device but wiring quality is very poor as mic caputres noise of sparking when wiring is disturbed.,1
751,"TRUE , Read once before buy you will Regret after buy","The worst thing i suffer is its size is too small that it won't even cover my ears, after 2hrs of use you will started to feel pain on ear. Not anything like ""EXTRAA Bass"" just more than any cheap earphone.
Pros- tangle-free n long wire.
Cons- u cant even realize 3D sound, just left n right.
Result- u can buy such quality headphone in low price",2
752,Pain,But after sometime we face too much pain on ears due to the pressure,2
753,Best at this price range,"The bass of this headphone feels incredible but is lesser as compared to other headphones, obviously that are available at higher price as compared to this. Hence, I can say that this is one of the best heaphones at this price range. Everything is great. I have been using it for a few days and there is no defections till now. Though I think the treble could be a bit higher which would make this the best at this price.

Hope you liked my review.",5
754,Weightless and serve the purpose for kids,I bought this for my son to attend the class and it definitely served the purpose. It is weightless and good for hearing songs as well. Mic is good and able to take up calls. Not having great noise cancellation but in a closed environment it is doing the purpose.,4
755,Good One,Not expected the haedphone will be very good. Recommended to the people for this price range and quality.,5
756,is it safe for the ears,a little skeptic about head phones affecting the ears and brain function which may be scientifically clarified or suitable disclaimers given please,2
757,Better than i expected,All i can say is these headphones have awesome bass and clear sound.I wasn't expecting this much in 750Rs.If you are looking for cheap and best just go for these.You can't get better than this in this price range.These are as good as a 2000-2500Rs range headphone.A little tight in the starting but who wants loose headphones:),5
758,Just great,"Awesome bass, perfect quality, little bitof noise cancellation (not technically,only practically) and extremely lightweight.
Mine lasted a year and one side stopped working. You can fix it if you solder the little red wire inside though.",4
759,Excellent headphone.,"Comfortable in fitting. Good quality jack, good cushions, nice sounds, clear microphone & thick bold wire.",5
760,Quality plus,"Bit tight for the ears ... Wire length is sufficient ears getting wet after long time use.
Build Quality is good overall average but worth of money",4
761,just amazing product,"really very nice product!!
extra brasss!!
carbon black!!
but the only problem i faced is lack of noise cancellation due to which surrounding noise isn't cancelled otherwise very good product!!",4
762,Very good headphones with mic.....price is also very reasonable,Very much classi product......nice sound....BASS is good......mic is good..... using in WebEx or Zoom session....also on my mobile......,5
763,I love it!,"The bass is just amazing. The build quality is good, I thought it would be just average plastic but it sure is tough and the 3.5mm pin is strong too and they have added a spring at the end of it. I bought it at 599 and at this price it's totally worth it and the sound is clear and amazing.",5
764,Comfortable and sounds great,The headset is lightweight and so comfortable to wear for long time. Sound quality is very decent.,5
765,Pin quality poor,"Giving only 2 star just because of poor pin quality. Pin got broken very quickly. Sound quality, noise cancellation and bass looks fine. But pin is very fragile and broken within 2 months.",2
766,best for pubg in best price range @699,"got in 699 rs ,reviewing after 2 months of use it is best for gaming ,gaming sound is best for pubg like games ,for music its like ok ok",5
767,100% genuine small compact size.,"Value for money as described in the shop list. So, much compact and easy to play with good long wire with touchless mic.",5
768,Waste of money,Worst and useless product ever...waste of money...it automatically shuffles the music by itself and turns off the volume....it is so irritating.,1
769,Dont waste your precious money,"It stopped working after 20 days of use dont buy it guys
first it stopped working on 1side then fully stopped pls dont buy it on any positive review pls dont waste your money",1
770,only for high bass lovers.,"material quality and durability Is best in market but I didn't like the sound quality, as the sound reproduction is not natural. If are a in love with minute details of sound quality definitely it's not for you better go for sony. This is best for college guys for rap and kinda music. High bass at this price is a great advantage for them.",3
771,The overall performance of the headphones is excellent,It is an excellent product worth the money. The performance of the equipment in all respects had been excellent.,5
772,Not good product,"I ordered boat bass 900 wired headphone, the audio quality is not good and there is always noisy sound in the background. The bass quality is not good.",1
773,Bit uncomfortable should buy over ear headphone.,Good but bit uncomfortable but it's natural with on ear headphone it could be use for 1/2 to 1 hours easily but after it would feel uncomfortable if u have to use more than 1 hour u should buy over ear headphone it is available in ranger 1000-1200 and would be best.....,5
774,Okay product. High audio leakage,Decent product at given price but can be avoided. I got it for 799/-. Very high audio leakage and longer usage leads to discomfort over the ears. Cable is longer than you would find in similar products.,3
775,Quality headphones,This is second or third boat headphones and I have found that these are real value for money product. Over all sound quality is very good and do is the bass quality.,3
776,Very good 👌 0p purchase . Very much good.,"Best in low budget . Heavy Bass . Can be used with any devices easily. Good cusion covering . Very quality good sound. Comes with 1 year guarantee .

777,Happy with product,Quite good! Have been enjoying songs day long! Noise cancellation is good to a level . Bass quality spectacular and sound quality good.,5
778,Sound Quality,Okay here's my review after using it for month's. What i like about it is that the sound quality is pretty good for it's price and the headphone jack quality is also very good but the bass quality could have been better. Overall it's a good headphone for it's price.,4
779,Best deal under 500₹,"It's a good deal @500
Sound quality and bass is good but no noise cancellation is available also my ear feels pain after some long time in use.
Because it's tight on ears.
If you found ur answers leave helpful

784,Excellent at this price,"Fantastic from boAt. At this price range, these are one of the best headphones. However only 4 stars because very tight in the beginning slowly its becoming comfortable but very very tight at the start",4
785,Awesome product......just go for it,"I received the product today ......thanks for the fast delivery from Amazon....... Headphone is lightweight,well designed and perfectly build....sound and bass are awesome.....never heard this type of bass and sound in wired headphones ........Thanks to boat for this awesome product.....just loved it",5
786,Bass for bass lovers,Full bass but mid and high frequencies are low. No balanced sound. But you can't expect more at 800 rs. Built quality is average.,4
787,PERFECT UNIQUE BASSHEADS GENUINE (PUBG),These headphones gives a pleasurable experience. The bass level is 4/5 that means very much impressive! The sound is so loud that you won't even hear whats happening around. Just download PowerAmp apk and just listen to favourable songs! Just worth it better than my previous Sennheiser headphones..,4
788,Value for money,"Good voice quality. Mic is also very good.
Music quality is also good.
Best for online classes.",4
789,Good Headphones,Light weighted and good sound. Worth to buy,4
790,Sounds are audible to others too,Sounds good but if somone is near or in the house they can also hear the music,3
791,Theater Experience,"Sound quality of head phones were very good and if you keep full sound you will get a theater experience but only the problem you'll face is ear pain, it push ears back and cause you pain but if you use more than a month continuously you'll be habituated to it and no problem with it",5
792,Bought for 300,"After discounts i finally bought it for just 300 rupee dont wait because i got with a coupon available with me
Wonderfull for the price

Music is decent and not extraordinary",3
793,best headphones for youngsters who need a great combination of sound quality and looks,"i was bit confused before buying this product but it's great ! , it offers passive noise cancelling which means that you would not be able to listen to external sound when volume is set high.
else you could easily hear outdoor sounds . - people talking etc.
it's quite durable and could easily withstand many jolts . ( durability is indeed very important )
best buy under 1k.",5
794,The best headphones ever,"You can blindly go for it!!
You will get next level experience
Built quality is excellent",5
795,its not for bass lovers.,Ontime delivered. the material is good. but it's not for bass lovers. I am really disappointed about bass. I didn't get little bit bass. there is no doubt about the clarity of sound. I got this for 749/-. ok for the price point of view. don't go for bass lovers. just extend your budget and you will get a good one.,4
796,"Defective headphones, no sound output within 3 months of buying","I purchased Boat Bassheads 900 On Ear Wired Headphones (Carbon Black) on 12th January, 2021 through Amazon.

799,Bang for the buck,This headset is really a bang for the buck product. Sound via the headset is great for the price. Only concern is the wire is of low quality and seems it will get damaged easily. Braided cable could have been better.,5
800,Sound comes out,"Sound is good and bass is also good
But when you listen music on full volume the sound comes out and my cousin said you should by speakers instead of this
And on full volume like someone hitting on your ear not familiar with ears I guess",3
801,It's really good.👍,"This is a pretty good product. The sound quality is pretty amazing. My daughter, while taking out the jack from the port, has broken it but it is still functioning properly. So, it is immune to wear and tears. So, you can buy this product without any hesitation.",5

Recommending this to my friends too:)",3
804,Just go with this,"Using from last 20 days ....awesome experience with boat & I can say one of the best wired headphone is this.

Love this.",5

809,Amazing headphones,"Fabulous product
I just loved it's sound quality
Bass is so thumping that could not be compared in this price range
Overall good product nice quality of material
It would cause pain in ear in starting because of the tightness but after a long use it would be comfortable
It's cable is too long and one can enjoy music from far apart
Nice product overall",5

But a bit tight for the ears..",4
816,Good buy. Value for money. Boat quality is good.,"Value for money and most importantly much better than blue tooth headset. This gives ease of quick start. Blue tooth is real headache if u have multiple devices.

About Boat, it is now a trusted brand and online purchase gives rate benefits as well. Worth referring to others.",5
817,3 months and still counting,Very delicate and Lightweight... should use very cautiously... worth the price... have been using for 3 months... Reinforced audio jack pin is a good feature,4

819,Good Sound Quality with Average mic,"Sound quality is nice, but does not have stereo effrcts. Bass is good. Mic quality is poor when you are using this with your laptop. Your voice is not transmitted clearly to opposite person. However you will not face the same issue while using with your cell phone",4

824,Its not just good but its great in this price,"I pay 699 for that and i am truly satisfied
If you are not a music genius then go for it because there are so many headphones are there in ₹5000 and above range for that kind of people who are music genius",5
825,A review,It is good headphone I bought it in sale at 699 bugs and if you want to buy than buy it in sale otherwise it expensive but had good bass and sound quality and it want to buy it at it's original price than also you could buy it it is good but I think little bit expensive,5
826,Its kind of Good,"The sound quality is decent but the headphones are too tight, it pains if you listen 👂 music or anything for more than 10 minutes. But it will soon fit according to head size,
The microphone is also not that good, the voice is very feeble.",3
827,Great for Online Classes and Long Video Calls,"Perfect ""over the ear"" product for long video calls, kids Online Classes. Does not hurt your ear. Mic works nice.
Great product.",5
828,Poor cushioning and hinges.,"I have been using it for last 1 year.
Poor quality of material is used for cushioning and hinges which support rotation.
Just within 6 months, the material which was used for cushioning was coming out.
Apart from that, there are no more issues.",1
829,It's so tight for ear,"It was really so tight for ear i Only used headphones for like 2 hours and then take it off and the pain man i only now the pain
And it's not really comfortable
But the sound quality is good and the bass man really good but the ear pain will kill u",3
830,Very Good Sound Quality for the Price,"Better than many major brands I have listened to. Its a steal for the price, Smooth 'highs', balanced Bass over all enjoyable listening. Try listening to some of Coke Studio's numbers which truly have some high quality recordings, the stereo imaging felt unbelievably awesome.",5
831,Best value of money...,"The product is too good in this price range.
But always keep volume low as it's too loud for ur 👂,they can get damaged ; then don't say the headset is waste 😒 or bad a product.
I will recommend to keep ur volume around(50-70)% ....🙏.....
Go ahead and tap on buy now option if in stock🔥🔥🔥",5
832,Don't expect more,"Not gives effect,some what good, it makes my ear heat, go for another product... Bass low, Treple ok,",3

834,All-rounder 😎👍,Good sound quality 😊. Good Base.Noise cancellation is passive but that is not bad for this price. When volume is increased 20% to upwards noise cancellation is more effective.I will recommend to buy. Only issue I found was thread was torned 2times when I replaced it also.,4
835,Worth it..,"Go for it..Loud sound, bass, mic and great color. All these in a price of 599/-👍🏻👍🏻",5
836,Unbelievable quality..,Great headset...I am really happy..the cost when I bought was around 650 ruppees but the bass n the sound is awesome n I wud definitely recommend it to everyone..,5
837,Too much expensive for the quality it's providing,"Okayish product, I bought it for 700something, I think earphones of boat itself or headphones of Philips would have been better choice with some cash added. The color is peeling off within short period, voice quality is not that good, noise cancellation is somewhat okay, look wise it's good. Overall review it's okay product, don't buy invest your money in some other product it may be fruitful.",2
838,Not good in excess sweat,Everything is very good sound build qulity in this price range...Wire is tick no tension abut pullimg out metal jack holds very good but only problem is its not very good sweat resistance form gets bubbly due to wear in gym,4
839,Worst quality - not recommended!,"Worst quality! Started malfunctioning in less than 3 months. It has become so worse that people can only hear loud, garbled static noise when I speak. Cannot even return now. Money wasted!",1

843,Great product,Great product. Needless to say in this price range these are the best headphones available.,5
844,Good for casual listening of music.,Good earphones with nice sound quality. Bass and treble optimized. Good for listening music / watching movies for an hour or so. There after the pressure on the ears makes it difficult to use.,4
845,Best headset with microphone,"This is the Best headset with a microphone. Good bass, mid and high-frequency output. build quality is very good.",5
846,My review,It is good for a budget option but it has really small ear cushions and using for long time may give you ear pain I would suggest you to have another boat headphones if you can afford them you can go for this if you are stucked on your budget,4
847,Simple and best...,Simple and good headphones. Its good to have decent voice from headphones rather than ear plugs which go deep inside.,5
848,Quilty good,"I bought it because boat after sales service is awesome that's why I bought it from Amazon.
Noise cancellation 2.5/5",4
849,Must Buy,"Incredible sound quality at this price .
Used for conf calls. Amazing clarity.",5
850,An exellent budget headphone,I bought this headset in the sale for 599 and I am happy with its performance to price ratio. Material quality is ok for the price . Sound quality is excellent for this price range and it is also durable. I am using it for past 6 months and I didn’t find any problem in this headphone. So iris an excellent product by boat,5

855,Best one ..go for it in low budget,"Iam writing this review after almost 40 days .I use this product daily for 9 hr during my
traningg and not once I had problem with it.",5
856,Defective Product,"Bought two together, One headset was ok and other one is defective, Mic has some issue and it makes some kind of noise when you talk or when it moves, Amazon denied replacement said contact service centre.
Poor service by Amazon. Other product that i bought from Amazon and Boat product was fine, Amazon should have provided replacement of it.",1
857,Worth it's price,Best sound quality. If you guys want to listen songs then you can definitely go for this one. But if you guys are looking for gaming heaphones then don't buy these because after some time you get pain in ears coz they don't fit on your ears that perfect.,5
858,Nice quality .. value for mone,this is my 2nd Boat headphone .. bought one last year. improved quality .. only -ve point - Sony sells similar model Rs. 50 cheaper,5

862,Cheap product ever,I received the product on 12th july and product is not working from 21st evening onwards. Just after 5pm it got stopped working like some one set the timer in it. The return policy window is also closed by the time we recognised. I cant imagine this kind of cheap product from BOAT/Amazon. Very dis-satisfied.,1
863,Waste of money,Sound Quality is not good as i expected.It's sound like a normal headphone.As compare with sound it's price same as 100 rupee headphone available in market.So don't waste your money to buy it.,1
864,Best product from boat..BUT!!!!,"I am giving my review after 3 months of useage.This one is absolutely a best head phone for this pricerange. It have sturdy construction and material quality is too good. The sound quality is really good and it will deliver good bass effect. But the most dissapointing fact is that whatever you hear (either song or call) through this head phone will be audible very clearly from ouside, even in low volume. This makes me rethink to make a call using this..",3
865,Good sound quality /this is for bass lovers,"This is indeed a pretty good one to buy in the wired segment. Though there are good wireless headphones available sound quality is always better in the wired ones. Bass lovers would love this, it generates and amplifies the bass, also the other minute details of the song are Clear!! Overall decent buy!!",5

1010,Bad connectivity,"Sound quality - 8/10
Battery -8/10
Design -8/10
Call experience -7/10
Box gets loose after 3-4 days
But the real issue is that its facing some connectivity issue...its like for 1 to 2 sec n then suddenly it gets normal again
Connectivity - 4/10 (connecting with iphone 8 plus) even if u cover ur earbud by ur hand it is start disconnecting. Those who r saying connectivity is good please try this step.
Gaming experience in low latency mode is good
Dont buy this for pubg
7/10",2
1011,Worst one don't buy,I got a defected product the left earbud had noise and the charging case had loose contact charging,1
1012,For music lovers only,"The product is well built and sound quality is also good for music lovers. Bass is loud, highs and lows are also well refined. Creates vaccum in ears if instructions given in guide booklet is followed.
Pairing is slowa and not instant. Takes time in connecting with the paired device (5-6 sec).
Bit difficult in taking the buds out of the case because of design flaw.
Call quality is not good anyways. Person at receiving end will not be able to get clear voice. May complaint about mufflled sound comming.
If you keep the buds in your pocket and walk you will hear a sound coming out of the case as the buds are little bit loose inside the case.
Overall, the product is average and is good for listening music but not for calling. Thinking of returning it.",3
1013,An honest review on the product.,"Pros:
1. 10 meters radius coverage.
2. If you use this with zoom meetings, you get normal audio and bass audio. Normal audio is loud, but bass audio is very, very louder and deeper.
3. Charging both case and pods are straightforward and easy.
4. Audio is clear on calls and audio music.
5. Since you get small, medium and large ear buds, you can customise this for your ear. Fits beautifully.

Cons:
1. Right out of the box, after 5 to 10 times using the charging box, it is loose.
2. If you use this to watch videos and movies, you will see lagging. Video will be first and short delay followed by audio.
3. Pods are delicate to handle. Please be careful.
4. No charger or charging cable provided, since I use Xiomi phone, I had the compatible charger, so was not a big issue here.
5. Although Chinese product, it holds its weight in new emerging market but with delicate materials, care should me main focus while handling this.

Since the box was loose, I gave 4 out 5. But, go for it. It's worth the investment. However, since this is my honest reviews, I would leave the decision to purchase entirely on you.

Good Luck, stay safe and have a wonderful day.

Update - 1: The volume dropped by 10% after some uses. When on calls, the voice lags, only sometimes.",4
1014,Bassy within Budget 🤩,"BASSSY within Budget 🤩

Starting from Build. Very light weight. Literally fitting inside ear without hurting. Best fit.👍

Connection Rock Solid, no drops. Best in class.✌️

All plastic but nice finish.🤞

Charging case looks very filmsy should handle with care. It should have been better quality but no complaints.🤞

Sound quality: I am not a audio pile. But as like most people loves to listen music. So based on my view, these buds are really good at bass. I personally like bass so it was good for my use. I watched one movie and few youtube videos, no latency. Good at those times as well.🤩

Overall good bassy budget true wireless headphones. You can buy if your budget is short and expecting good VFM headphones.🤩🤩🤩",5
1015,Major issues with one of the ear buds - stopped working,"Updated review a month’s usage -
- had to exchange the product as the left earbud stopped working within 5 days.
- call quality isn’t that good as experienced during business group meetings, the voice trails off in-between and you loose the conversation
- the earbuds aren’t very comfortable for longer duration usage as it starts hurting
- go for these earphones if only you are on a tight budget of less than 1.5k OR if you want to experiment with a TWE.
- build quality is questionable and I suspect one of the earbuds will stop working anytime
- aside from these negatives, it’s quite decent for the price offered and Bluetooth pairing works smoothly across IOS and android devices

Old review when tested for 3 days - It all comes down to the ‘why’ you need a TWS or truly wireless earphones. If your reason, like mine was for a decent pair of TWS earbuds at a throwaway price of less than 2/3k and the utility I wanted mostly from it was the ability to make phone calls with clarity and without much environmental background noise and also to watch a movie/listen to songs with decent sound quality - then these earbuds are a definite buy. If your need is for earphones with high-very high sound quality for your music/movie watching, then these won’t satisfy you. Aside from the tech specs already the company provides, my personal pro’s and con’s are as such -
Pros
- incredibly cheap pricing for a decent TWS and balanced features at this price
- both earbuds work independently and you can use a single earbud as well
- great phone call quality as I experimented over the last few days. I conducted business calls over a mask and in the outdoors with background noise but the receiver never complained of the sound quality
- great power backup - gives 4 hours constant usage and then the case gives a total of 12hr backup
- it also has Siri/google assistant support
- the case has a lovely matte finish and the earbuds magnetically close into them. The ability to give a premium feel to such cheaply priced earphones is awesome

Cons 1
- build quality - the earbuds in itself gives a cheap plasticky quality but it’s definitely lightweight
- form factor - I would say I am not too happy about the fit of the earbuds into the ears. This could differ from person to person. For me personally the earbuds while they do fit in, they don’t feel safely snug in them for usage during athletic activity like running or working out
- this is asking for much for sure but the button on the earbuds thats used for activating the voice assistant and for play/pause media is quite hard to click and that hurts when one has to do so while wearing it. If only it could have had been touch sensitive.",3
1016,Only buy if your budget is really tight,"Considering its price its okayish but nothing extra ordinary
Treble : 6/10
Bass : 1/10
Overall sound quality 5/10
Battery 7/10
Build quality 8/10
Gaming performance 10/10 no lags in gaming mode
Overall value for money :
50 - 50

1018,Redmi 2C Earbuds is fits comfortably in the Ears.,"Got delivered product in between 12hrs thank you Amazon for such a quick delivery.
Coming to the product.
Considering its budget.

Pros:
* Sleeky design fits comfortably in the Ears
* Very lightweight
* Automatic pairing is a plus point
* Bluetooth 4 or above versions can also view the amount of charge left in Earbuds.
* Comes handy with case, easy to carry.
* Splash proof
* Deliver the sound as crisp and clear.
* If you're a music 🎶 lover with preferable sound at minimal level you can go for it.
* It has decent Bass

Cons:

* Doesn't look as premium as in images
* I feel in the left ear bud sound is producing low compared to right bud, but not everytime, may be it's because of Mono and Stereo channel's or audio drivers depends upon music.
* They should have provided a charging cable with the earbuds, that's ok we can manage with our regular mobile chargers.
For me I got defected product which only worked for 2hrs there after Right earbud stopped working so I placed order for returning the product.

*If you're a Hard Music lover who needs full amount of bass to get blood from the Ears, don't go for it😜.",3
1019,Cheap earphones sound quality,Bad output.. the buds sounds like a cheap earphone..very low bass whlile listening to music & catches the background noise over a call which creates a lot of disturbance.,1
1020,Best true wireless earbuds under 2k,"I've been using this product for the last 2 days and here is my opinion on it.
The battery backup is good. The battery lasts 3-4 hours on regular mode and 2 hours on gaming mode. The build quality is good. The sound is the best under 2k. I've used many earbuds under 2k but this may not have the largest driver but it has the best quality drivers. The only issue I have is that xiaomi did not provide a charging cable in the box. But well done xiaomi.",5
1021,Worth the price,"One of the best true wireless earphones under 2k, even if they overpriced it in India , I would say it’s worth it.
Pros -
1. Vocals sound simply amazing ! Highs , mids , simply awesome !
2. These are really small and very compact, when I got these in my hands I was like daaayyymmmn tis tiny ! The case is very small that I misplaced it somewhere and couldn’t find it
3. The fit is just perfect, you can’t even feel it in your ears
4. Gaming mode - it actually works ! I’ve tried the realme buds air with gaming mode and I’ve got to say these are on point to it. PUBG and COD is just flows very smoothly, giving a lag free gaming experience
5. Connectivity is also amazing

Cons-
1. Built quality, the feel and look extremely cheap, the lid of the case is all wobbly, I think it’s gonna Break
2. Bass, the bass is alright but when listening to some songs it sounds like someone farting,
3. Battery life is just average
4. With gaming mode on the battery gets drained pretty quickly
5. No charging cable in the box, but who doesn’t have a micro usb cable these days ? 😏

At the end, I would recommend this with all my heart.",4
1022,For sound 3/5. For mic 1/5,"Delivery was very fast even during lockdown.
About earbuds, not happy with mic... You cannot even take call with this earbuds.. Your voice does not reach to the mic... I received this eaebuds with faulty mic of one earbud. Only one mic was working.",1
1023,Useless Chinese product,"Edit: 14th October: hence proved cheap Chinese product as the replacement earbuds stopped working after 2 days. PLS STAY AWAY

These are my 1st true bluetooth earphones and I must say they sound impressive.
Got the 1st pair replaced as the right earbud sounded distorted on calls and music. Got the replacement in 24 hrs.
The battery life is decent and they have decent bass however it does justify the price point. The fitting is nice and fits perfectly and does not fall off from the ears. Battery life is acceptable 2.30 to 3 hrs in one charge on high volume while listening to music. I’m sure it will last long if only used for calls. The charging case is also very compact and easily fits the pocket. I had no issues connecting with my iphone 8 plus and my laptop. The range is decent at 10-15 feet post which it looses connection.

Overall its value for money!",1
1024,Pathetic,Sound quality is poor...there is delay in game sound....i read that these are specially for pub g and it really sucks in Pub G...not good for listening music as well...oneplus bullets z aree way better,1
1025,Poor quality product with very poor battery,"Not good enough product features. The quality of product bit cheap.

Cons:
1. Pathetic battery, hardly gives 10-15 min time even after 8 hrs of charging.
2. picking up the earbuds form the case is not easy as they dont pop out and kind of stuck
3. No Charging indicator on the case/earbuds.
4. Connectivity options are very limited, no option to connect to more than 1 device
5. Does not connect automatically.

Pro:
1. Cheap pricing.

There are better products in the same price line.",1
1026,Don't buy.,"Review after 6 days. Left side stopped working after 4 days. Amazon replaced it but the new one also stopped working after 2 hours of usage only. Returned it and getting my money back. Don't go for cheap one. Better to buy something branded and reliable.

Its a good product. But the sound is not that good. Attended few calls and I am not impressed with the call quality. In this price range what can we expect more. However I am still giving a benefit of doubt that it just a few hours I have used and may improve after few days as other headphones or speakers improve. Will give another review after extensive uses.
Great for startup with buds.",1
1027,Don't Buy it,"Update- After using it for the last 25 days...
This has to be the worst product I used ever...please don't buy it...
This product has soooo many flaws...
If I leave out the fact that this is good only aesthetically...there is no good thing about this product...

Firstly,
The sound quality isn't good at all..
400 Bucks MI Earphones has much better sound..
This one is just loud.. not bass.. you will get a headache within 30 mins of continuous usage..
Sound - 4/10

Secondly,
The bluetooth connectivity is very poor.
Mid songs you will face sound drops multiple times.
When you keep the phone in your pocket then also you might face this issue...
Products lot cheaper than this has much better connectivity...the same problem I faced in laptops and tv connectivity...too much sound drop... multiple times...
Connectivity- 1/10

Thirdly,
Not meant to be used during calls...the other side can hardly hear you or they can hear a robotic voice...the battery backup is also a lot less than what they mention
Calling/battery - 2/10- 5/10

Lastly,
This product's only selling point is the way it looks... Nothing other than that
Aesthetics- 8/10

I don't recommend this at all... I know 1800 is a small price for truly wireless but hey I can understand the sound quality but when they can't even offer proper bluetooth connectivity then makes no sense buying this..
Go for wired ones or the wired bluetooth ones...but don't waste your money here on this...",1
1028,Not for gaming !,"Guys if you're buying this for gaming just forget it !!! You can't play the latency is just so high (delay in sound) you can't play any MP or battle royale games!

And for daily usage these are bombs :-) just for it if you just want to use it as an multiplayer bluetooth headset/buds

Battery backup is amazing ! So far so good

Good call quality

Buttons are very clicky
Good sound quality
Very light weight",5
1031,Very poor choice for calls,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 If you are planning to also use it for making calls (phone, whatsapp, hangout etc.), then you would really repent it. You would sound hollow and unclear to the other person, even when there is no background noise. In my test I switched between BT and Phone while talking and it made huge different to the other side. I attached the voice recorded on the other side as a video, you can play see the difference yourself.

Music sounds fine though I didn't do any specific test and wasn't looking for anything extraordinary in that department anyway. In the short test that my son said, he didn't like the music even compared to his existing cheap bluetooth over the ear headset.

The design is not very comfortable, it projects out of the ear and can easily get knocked off (e.g., when you are adjusting your hair, or attending to some itch). I also found the buttons to be too easy to get depressed. I was trying get them into my ear after answering a call and I accidentally pressed the button and the all got disconneted.",2
1032,Average go for wired,"Coming back from Wired earphones,this one seems pathetic in my opinion and I've tried to play PUBG mobile with the gaming mode on and the lag issue doesn't give that optimal feel of gaming and audio quality is okayish in my opinion and the microphone quality is not that great I have to speak a bit louder for the other parties to hear (not for hush ones). Built quality is okay no complaints regarding that.",2
1033,A great buy for its price!,"Great product at this cost. Too many fake products online. I am the first reviewer and since, there were no reviews, I was bit reluctant to purchase. But I bought it and no regrets. Worth every penny! What one can expect in 1799 rs.",5
1034,Gets the job done in this price range,"Just got this few hours back and gets the job done.

Do not expect punchy bass, the sound quality is over all good.

The best feature is you can use one bud at a time if you need to take a lot of calls, when the charge gets over for first one, put the other one..

Strangely there is no charging cable in box, but I'm not bothered about it as i already have one for this.

In short, i would have purchased it in 2500 as well.. 1800 is a steal for this.",5
1035,Right bud not working after 1 month!!!!,"Update: The right earbud is not working at all after a month. I can't get it to work. I have to file for a warranty replacement. It stopped working so suddenly. I had not been using it for a week and when I picked it up to listen it just wouldn't pair or turn or. No lights.

Please do not buy this if reliability is your criteria.

It looks like true wireless earbuds have finally reached the price point of wired earbuds from 5 years ago.

My only requirement was for workouts. Ordered yesterday and they were delivered today. I think it was less then 12 hours since my order. I can't believe how fast Amazon delivery is.

Took them out for an hour long bicycle ride. These were my first impressions

1. They stay in your ear and seal it well regardless of what you're doing. After sometime you would forget they're there.
2. Quite comfortable even with sweating. I may have adjusted it a few times to reseal the ear. Overall they serve the purpose of workout earbuds extremely well.

Sound quality
1. Mediocre at best. I didn't expect them to sound excellent (considering what I paid) but they sound quite decent.
2. Boomy bass, recessed mids and soft highs.
3. I listened to an audiobook while cycling and a few tunes. Was impressed with what I could hear. Mind you, when working out, you aren't concentrating on music. And the workouts keep changing the seal of the earbuds causing a sort of going in and coming out of water sound effect (I'm not sure if people can understand this sound effect- imaging putting your head under water and taking it out - the way the sound changes that's what it felt like for every bump in the road during cycling - I'm sure joggers will face this too)
4. Noise isolation was decent when the buds sealed the ear, but since the ear canal shape changes during constant motion of workout, the noise isolation only worked if I pushed them in a little more. I did have to increase the volume during traffic to hear what was playing (only did this for testing-i don't recommend increased volumes)
5. Was able to hear everything clearly at less than half the volume on phone. Didn't test maximum loudness.

Build and other considerations:
1. Very sturdy build quality.
2. Buttons are tactile and give good feedback.
3. Controls could have been more intuitive but nothing you can't get used to.
4. Case is very nice for storing and charging. Has indicators on the case and the buds themselves to show charging and pairing.
5. Loved the automatic pairing when taken out of case and press the button for music. Couldn't get any easier.

Overall, I'm quite satisfied. I have not tested battery life yet. It's only been 3 hours since delivery. Haven't tested call quality as well.

I would recommend this to people looking for cheap workout buds that won't fall of their ears. People looking for best sound quality, look elsewhere.",1
1036,Microphone quality is very bad.,"The person at the other end of the call will complain of not being able to hear properly. I was shocked, so I tried recording my voice thru voice recorder and I heard what I had recorded, it was very very bad. This product is not up to the mark, I had to return it.",1
1037,Not able to listen one sing.. pausing every second.,When your try to listen music..it is pausing every second..it is really frustrating..I tried to play song in wink I thought it is not compatible so I tried with YouTube..facing same issue..I just received the product.. I don't know if I got the defective product. Return the product..I m big fan of mi phones so I thought it will be a great deal to buy their airbuds too. Disappointed..,1
1038,DO NOT BUY. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.,Terrible. Had heard really nice reviews about this one but obviously seem to be paid reviews now. The volume on these are really low and you can easily hear external sounds even at full blast volume. The voice starts to bleed out and is giving a weird static noise. Sound seems to be bursting in a weird manner. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. Will be initiating a return for these. I'm not sure if I got a defective product or its the same in all of them but mine surely were a pathetic purchase.,1
1039,Very flimsy and cheap quality.,"Bought this as this looked like an imitation of Galaxy Buds. Imitation it is. It looks great in pictures. In reality it is very flimsy and of very poor quality. As for sound, you get what you should at this price-point. You might as well go for any neck-band type earphones if you don't have the budget. Else, you may want to consider brands such as Aukey, but as a true wireless earphones, this isn't worth the experience.",1
1040,Don't expect anything great.,"Issues I faced :
- Voice is muffled over a call, we have to speak at the top of our voice
- Audio crackles while using YouTube
- Button on the earphone is very tight, when we press it the earpiece presses against the ear
- Audio quality also poor (2/5)",1
1041,Not worth,"Earbuds are not good. It is behaving in appropriate in iphone. Volume suddenly goes up and down without touching it. Also it does not have touch instead it has buttons to press and control that to for play, pause and you can activate shiri to do job by pressing twice. Last but not the least it is not made in Indian manufacturing unit. It has been manufactured in China",2
1042,One side of ear buds stopped working.,"[changing my review. 3 days past and one side completely dead. No sign of charging, no sound .. nothing. Very common issue by reading other reviews]

I have some high end ear buds and head phones but those all at times can be a little bulky and wearing them for prolong time can cause some pain and uncomfortable around head and ears.

I was searching for some super light Bluetooth ones which I can wear for mostly listening podcast and audio books. I saw these for 1299/- and couldn't wait to give it a try given the weight is just 4gram each.

Here are few good things about these buds -

1. Super light like feather. You may use for hours and still won't feel that you have ear buds on most of time. Great audio for listening books, sleeping meditation, podcast etc.

2. Charge last for good long time. I am sure you won't be able to exahut the battery in single use.

3. Fit well and seems pretty steady in ear for general purpose use.

4. Audio is greay for songs but I don't think they stand next to high end like Bose or Apple airpods etc.

5. Fast and reliable Bluetooth connection but distance is less than 6-7 meters at best if phone and buds aren't in straight line. Too bad if you are in house and moving around while your phone is stationary.

6. Because of their sungness and noise cancellation, they cut out a lot of noise of outside at reasonably high volume.

7. Call quality at the other end will be good and the person on call with you ,will hear you clearly.

What I think could be improved -

1. Phone call quality is good , sound is crisp and clear BUT super low. Even in the maximum volume, it sounds pretty low. Hope it's not the defect of my buds. You can still make call and hear voice but you need to be attentive enough.

2. Case is cheap and not going to last long. I think the top lid will come off soon although it won't break the charging function and pods are magnet attached but it's flimsy and cheap.

3. I wonder if they are meant for rigorous excercises buds. You can surely do some basic lifting and all but anything like lots of movement or speed running etc and I think they will fall out easily.

In nutshell , kind of value money.

If you want something super light , podcast/audio books , meditation purpose and ready to handle it with care then go for it.",1
1043,Disappointing,"Had got my hands on these as I was planning to get one only for the sole reason of avoiding any kind of wires. At this price point I would say it is worth the money spent. It comes in a small magnetic case which is about 6cm*4cm*3cm. The earbuds fit snugly and are lightweight. Overall a good choice. Few points for buyers
-The earbuds magnetically fit into the case. The case lid is magnetic too
-The pairing happens automatically when you take them out of the case. Any kind of pairing problem might be due to earbud malfunction or your device's bluetooth being old
-There was very little/no bass but the vocals were crystal clear. The sound does not break at higher volumes.
-Connection of the buds is strong and works flawlessly at a distance. Might fluctuate near devices like microwave, Modem, etc.
-The noise cancellation (ENC) works okaish. The receiver might hear some background noise if you are in a noisy area. The mic on the buds are on the inside and will work best for a tight fit. If the buds are lose then your voice will suffer.
-Can be used as a mono bud. When you close the lid of the case the buds automatically disconnect
-Last more than 4 hours at lesser volume.
-Might slip out of the ears when talking or chewing for obvious reasons but overall it fits tight.
-Lag should not be an issue. The battery on them is shown on your phone.

Update:- The left earbud stopped working on day 4. Don't know if it is a hardware issue because everyone is having the same problem. I got it replaced and guess what, the replacement bud stopped working within minutes. They did not even try. I issued a refund. Hopefully add some more bucks to my budget and get a better working TWS. I really had high hopes for these.",2
1044,Your call,"Writting this review after 2weeks of moderate use, er... I have discarded my wired earphones and using this daily for atleast 7-8 hours. Does that count as moderate usage 🤷🏽‍♂️?

Let me make things clear first, I am no music expert. I won't be talking about highs, lows, mids. And if you're here, it's quite probable that either you've watched reviews on YouTube already or are going to check them out. But not everyone is saying truth there I guess.

Ok, let's start talking on these earbuds.

:Pros:

• Weight: these are quite light, slightly heavier than regular wired ones. You won't feel any discomfort having them installed in your ear.
•Watching videos offline: you'll have to adjust audio delays. Once done, trust me you won't return to your wired earphones. And adjusting audio delays is quite easy using different media players
•Watching videos online: YouTube videos are good with these. But I have noticed a slight lag watching online videos on browsers
• Listening to music: My experience was quite good. But the sound was not of the best quality.
•Battery backup: You can watch two movies back to back without charging the buds. So that also worked for me.
•Design: Owing to its lightweight and ergonomic design, it fits very well in ear, and it never fell out of my ear while runnig or cycling.
•Connectivity: Connectivity is good. And I mean good. Provided you are near your phone, within 5-10 meters I guess. After that it starts to break. And let me remind you, 10 meters is 33 feets.

:CONS:

•Case: After using for 2-3 days, buds inside the case start to get loosened. And now you can hear them rattling against the case when you shake it. And sometimes it stops getting charged and instead pairs up with my phone. That's irritating.

•Consistency: These buds are not consistent, not in connectivity, not in battery backups. The above review, if you've read till now, is based on it's performance average.

•Call quality: Now this is the question many people are asking. No you don't deliver a clear voice over phone while receiving call through these, when you are outside. But when you're in home, or in a quiet place, they don't notice dropping of voice. When you're outside you can use one of thee buds as mouthpiece and another as earpiece, that'll do.
• Guarantee: They don't come with a guarantee, atleast I didn't find any.

So, if you are planning to upgrade from your wired headset, you can certainly go for this. Or maybe you can wait for a better earphone to come. 🤷🏽‍♂️",4
1045,Just for true wireless sake...,"This is only and only for someone who want an earbuds. Period. Its not for someone who is a music enthusiasts nor for gamers. Within 3 hours of use i filed a return. Here's why.

1. The sound is bad. The sound clips a lot I played with various music player and streaming apps like Amazon music, Spotify and Google Play etc. all sounded the same lack of everything. Bad very bad.
2. The game mode does work well but still there is a lag.
3. It pops out of ears doesn't matter how hard you push it in the ears it will not have a good hold. If you have oily skin then God bless you keeping it in.
4. The build quality is really good along with the charging case well built plastic only reason i gave a two star.
5. Call is average. During phone call the other person was able to hear me properly but during video call not so much.

So if you just wanna own an earbuds just for its true wireless sake you can buy this as it is really cheap and a well known brand. For others please spend money.",2
1046,Better. All aspects. N O P E !,"(this is the second edit)
You would not believe this...... something happen just after posting this review.

1st review:

Great one, well... at this price point. I had the Xiaomi Mi airdots and wanted a replacement as you know.. at this kind of price point you are just getting something that works. As a matter of fact, these are amazing. Go for it.
Pics for size comparison. The white ones are the original airdots from Xiaomi.
Also, please don't complain about the bass. These are loud enough as long as you fine the perfect fit ear buds for yourself.

Edit:
The left side buds stopped.",1
1047,Loved them,"Muddy sound quality with overpowering bass because of which the mids and highs aren’t clear. They also get pretty loud and are extremely comfortable. In fact you cant even feel them in your ears. The case is made up of flimsy plastic and i feel like if your drop them once the case will crack.
Sound: 4
Comfort: 8
Mic :5
Connectivity: 6",5
1048,Scale Changer - Think Before You Buy. - Ratings: 3/5,"Pros:
1. Good Connectivity and easy to switch between devices.
2. Single earbud mode use. However, you cannot pair the other earbud with any other device. The moment it comes out of its case it pairs with the second earbud that is already in use.
3. Ear Fitting is good. Can fit small ears easily.
4. Sound Quality:
a. Bass: 2/5 - Bass is punchier but it does not resonate on the exact scale (note) of the song. So, you will hear bass but won't be able to feel it resonate with your eardrums. It would seem like an additional instrument is being played formally.
b. Mids: 4/5 - The mid is pretty good on this device.
c. Highs/Treble: 3.5/5 - The audio is pretty clear and loud.
d. Noise Cancellation: Very good noise cancellation because of the design and fitting.
5. Battery life: Approximately 3 hours of playback time on medium volume levels.
6. Very Good Call (including mic) quality: The mics are really sensitive. When on call, the caller can even hear your footsteps clear and loud.

Cons:
1. Scale Changer: I am surprised and have never seen this in my life. It changes the scale of the song in between the playback. I don't know the reason but it is horrible. No other earbuds do this. For a musician, this sucks!
2. Jitter/Delay - There is a very small amount of delay in sound being played on screen which may or may not be noticed by you all. Musicians can identify the same easily.
3. Box/case Design - I feel that the case could have been much sleek for carrying it in pockets.
4. Connectivity drop issues when used on Desktop/PC Windows - More often, There is a lag and connection drops continuously when paired and used with Windows PC/Laptop.",3
1049,Amazing buy 😍,"Great Product. Loved the music vocals. Call quality is excellent as well. Do not think. Go ahead and buy. Stunning deal at 1800₹.

Time to go truly wireless.",5
1050,Too much issues don't buy.,"There are many cons in this product and FYI i am using 1+6 device and bought this on next day of launching and as per redmi i thought i will be ok but ..
1) Call quality is poor, u always get some sort of chipping noise or an absurd background noise on other side.... 5 out of 10 times Other end person can't even hear u clearly, u have to speak much louder then normal.
2) Battery issue. It discharged very quickly, like 95% to 30% in 22-25 mins usage which is very opposite to what they claim of.
3) some times these earbud adjust volume of your device as per there own without even touching it.
So i will say wait for realme buds that about to launch in some days and i think they will be cheaper than this with better audio.",2
1051,It's Terrible,"I am usually fan of MI products, but this product is just horrendous.. it's a complete waste of money:
1. The volume has gone down to barely audible in less than one month.
2. From the very beginning the mic was not very good. Now in less than a month of use, almost all callers say they can't hear me, so i have to simply switch back to the phone. They are useless as handsfree.
3. When running, the left one makes noise, like the pieces inside have gotten lose and are rattling around.",1
1052,Decent package,"This won't woo the music lover but it is good for casual listening with a good combination of low mids and highs.
Having tried 4 other TWS earbuds, the one that pleased the music lover in me was Skullcandy Sesh.
In all 4 TWS, none has the capability to be perfect for calls. In each one of them outdoor calling was horrible.
Redmi earbuds S on other hand provide much better calling experience. And since the music quality is also decent, I give these earbuds double thumbs up.
If your only preference is music, then you might want to scale up a bit on the budget.
But if you want enjoyable music experience, decent calling functionality and a very compact sized earbud, these should do the job just fine.
It is very hard to argue about anything at this price point actually.
Tweak a bit on EQ on your mobile device (any player with EQ settings) and you can get a better thump in your music.",4
1053,Overall Good 👍,"Don't expect a bass heavy set of headsets, but some amount of bass is there on offer. Mids are just at par and a decent amount of treble is what you are going to get from these. If you are looking for a piece for playing games, the low latency mode works quite fine. Overall it's a Jack of all trades kind of headset. But when you bring in the price factor, is probably the best you can get in the market as of now.
Cheers !!",5
1054,Disaster than 2020 year,"This is my 7th product from MI that tells how much I love xiamoi products.
But not with this product, its such a patentic product.
I order this product without looking into early reviews.
I am very excited when I receive the earbuds and connected to mobile, that's it my mind got blocked after hearing ""hisssssss"" noise from one of the ear bud.
I replaced the item. In between I check the ear buds and observed
1. battery is not good.
2. Auto bluetooth connect is not working.
3. Bluetooth connectivity is not good sometimes you have to connect it manually.
4. Call quality is bad.
5. Noise cancellation is pathentic, in a call receiver end hearing lots of echoo.
6. Even pouch quality is not good.
7. In long run sound from left ear bud is stopped working after reconnecting it worked fine.",1
1055,Value for money product,"I had seen and used this product almost a year ago, a friend of mine has the Chinese version (it's essentially the same); I liked it then itself but decided not to import it from China.

I was already using other True Wireless Earbuds, namely Libratone Track Air+, Jabra Elite 65t Active, and Apple's Airpod (first version ... not in the picture). I loved the sound quality of Libratone Track Air+, connectivity, and mic quality of Jabra Elite 65t Active and Apple's Airpod ... overall really good (I am completely in Apple's ecosystem).
However, when I read about Xiaomi launching the Airdots (Redmi Earbud S in India), I was intrigued and with a price point of 1700/- ... I found it no brainer to buy one (though it's cheaper in China but importing and warranty ... better to buy in India itself). I have used these with my iPhone, iPad, Redmi Note 7 Pro, MacBook Pro and HP laptop.

Here are my thoughts (broken in Pros and Cons)

Pros
1 - I like the price point of these TWE. A year or two ago, it was common to see wired Bluetooth earbuds being priced at 3000 and onwards. MI, Realme, and Oppo have changed the game now.
2 - Its a very lightweight product. I have used these earbuds till I drained them from fully charged to almost dead, I did not get any ear fatigue ... in my view, this is a major win over many other earbuds.
3 - By no means, I am an audiophile but having used multiple audio products (both expensive and cheap ones), I can say, these earbuds deliver a lot at this price point. My suggestion - Try and use the right ear-tips to get the best sound quality.
4 - I don't expect it to have any notice-cancellation feature but with right silicon ear-tips, the outside noise is pretty much blocked (this can be both pros and cons).
5 - Inside the case, these earbuds are held magnetically so then don't fall when the case lid is open.
6 - 4+ hours of battery life in the earbuds, that's really good, plus the charging case provides an additional two charging. This is pretty standard, but considering how lightweight are these ... it's quite a feat.
7 - I used these for audio calls and video conferences and there were no concerns from anyone on the other side. I specifically asked and they mentioned, I sounded crystal clear. This is major win for these earbuds.

However, not everything is amazing with these TWE ... Cons
1 - I was disappointed to find that no charging cable is provided with these.
2 - It uses a micro USB for charging ... really. In 2020 .. who does that? Plus, there is no charging cable in the box, so I needed to find one lying in the junk box.
3 - Its difficult to take the earbuds out of the charging case. There is no slot from where you can grip the earbuds and take it out easily ... at least, I haven't found one yet.
4 - Only Black color option ... boring. In China, they have 2 or 3 more options.
5 - The click buttons on the side of the earbuds are slightly tighter and that caused pressure on my ears when trying to use them. These need to be softer.
6 - Though the earbuds haven't fallen out of my ears yet, having rubber wings of some sort, might have given some assurance to active lifestyle users.
7 - No IP ratings ... so I am not sure what will happen if you sweat a lot and these get wet ... or maybe you can be caught in the rain. My suggestion, avoid any wet conditions.
8 - The lids are not magnetically shut but then they don't come open easily ... so I am neutral on that. Still having the magnets would have been interesting and useful.
9 - Lastly, this is not a premium product but could have used an app that can provide EQ options, upgrading firmware, etc.",5
1056,Waste of money and efforts,Worst product in this class ....no forward and backward play ...they barely reaches 2hours on one go and some time their is lot of disturbance ..inshort in this range their are other products which are worth spending money on i this range ...worst part is they are not returnable ;(,1
1057,Chota Packet Bada Dhamaka (only if your budget is very tight),"As per my observations these are best earbuds available in the market under this price range (<2000). So go for it if you dont want to invest more than 2000 for earbuds.

BASS: 4/5 (above avg)
NOISE CANCELLATION: 4/5
BATTERY BACKUP:4/5 (under 2000)
CONNECTIVITY:4/5
PRODUCT QUALITY: 3.5/5
CALL QUALITY: 3.5/5
............................................................
OVERALL RATING: 3.8/5
UNDER 2000 RATING: 4.5/5

Pros:
1. Bass is good.
2. Connectivity is upto 8m in real environment.
3. Battery Backup is avg.

Cons:
1. Plastic Quality is highly compromised.
2. Not suitable for long audio calls.
3. No charging cable provided.",4
1058,Loving it experience,"A truly wireless earbuds. A perfect earbuds with a combination of deep bass perfect highs and mids.
Nicely fits to my ears without any pain even after a long use.
Very soft Ear tips, gives a comfortable experience.
Worth buying it.",1
1059,"Decent TWS earphones, but not that great.","Pros-
•Good looking earphones
•Small & Compact case
•Good Battery life
•Decent Call Quality
•Good Fit.
•No latency while streaming videos
•Good Sound isolation.
•IPX4 rating
•Price -1799/- (Can’t call it a steal at this price point though. It’s just about right, any thing above this price point and you can buy better ones)

Cons-
•Music Quality is OK (Good for bollywood music and maybe Pop/EDM,BUT THATS IT)
• MATTE Finish- The Case &The Ear buds have Matte Finish on their plastic, which is GOOD TO LOOK. But it tends to be slippery, I mean once, I had a hard time taking them off the charging case(can blame dry hands too)

Overall, They are just FINE.
I bought these for my dad for his daily music needs and a lot of hands free calls. He liked them.
But if anyone else wants more out a headphones then look somewhere else.

Thank you.

PS- I did not use the Gaming Mode.",3
1060,Act of Fooling people..,"Yes, MI fooling their buyers with this product saying it has special features like game mode!!! Actually, Their is no such low latency mode. If you made game mode off then 1 second lag is there. That Other earphone work fine without low latency mode, no lags.
Sound quality is ok ok. But not as expected by MI. Built quality is good, suffering with case box issues. If you place earbuds into casing box then it is supposed to disconnect from phone while it is changing but that doesn't happen. Also earbuds not make contact to charging point. Case gives you back up for 1-1.5 times. Earbud works for 2.5-3 hrs hardly.
Bluetooth connectivity is also poor. If you place hand on earbud while wearing, it gets disconnected. Sounds funny? But it is there.
Need to mention that pathetic experience in calling with this. Your voice can't reach to listener at other side. Also creepy sound is heard in between conversation. It is not ideal for traveling as well. You may lose either earbuds.
Pricing as almost doubled in indian Market than china. So not worthy as much 1799.
I have used this for 3 days and with my experience I won't suggest anybody for buying this.",2
1061,Excellent performance for the price range,"I am going to write my comments based on the price bracket!

1. Excellent sound, surprisingly - Base (soft & clear) and treble. I should mention that to get the best sound from an In-Ear device, it is important to have an ear tip that creates an airtight contact between the ear tip and the ear. So, choose an ear tip correctly, sometimes picking a one that is not part of the OEM pack; buy separately.
2. Great call quality and reception from these budget ones. The quality of sound was truly clear at the other end

The only annoying part was the design of the ear buds is that the surface is plane; so it is sometimes a little difficult to take them out of the box.",5
1062,Is Huami.... Surely not Xiaomi.... Horrible and waste,"Really don't know what's gone into Xiaomi and how they could make such a horrible product, it doesn't deserve to be launched commercially, horrible is least to say, there seems to be a bass wave and actual soundand then both are superimposed just to give heavy bass experience. If you try to talk using them, good luck, the person on other side will not hear anything",1
1063,"Convenient, just convenient, nothing else!","I use tws buds from last 4 years, this is my 3rd tws bud. Other two was sourced from china.
Cons:
1. Sound quality is bad, and you don't need to be an audiophile to know that. No bass, absolutely nothing, my two year old cheap chinise tws earbuds had tighter bass, any boat or mi headphones wired will have better bass than this. Its just single stroking sound, no low end seperate sounds. Only mid is clearer, high is not crisp. Overall they are dull.
2. Surrounding sound is really bad. Even with game mode in PUBG you can't find out whether the enemy is on front or back, it's only left or right. You can't make out the direction except left or right.
3. Sound seperation is really bad. You can only hear mid properly in a song. Instruments and bass takes backstage. Very bad for songs.
4. The base could have had bigger battery. You need to charge the base everyday if this is your only pair of earphones. And the charging via micro usb is very slow.
Pros :
1. Bluetooth connectivity is superb. Connection doesn't break, unlike my previous tws es. Both single and double connectivity is really good.
2. Very convenient. Small, light, easy to carry. I generally use single one to watch YouTube videos at night. I can even use both while lying.
3. Game mode has very low latency. You can use it for gaming, only issue is with surround. You can make out with left and right but can't whether the sound is coming from front or behind.
4. Fit is good,if not great. Doesn't fall off the ear.
I would suggest u to wait for a few more twses to launch. This one is below avarage in terms of sound quality. Buy wired or collar type bluetooth earphones if you need better sound in the price range.",3
1064,Edit: They help me fix it! Stops working in a month. One side doesn't charge,"It works till it works. Then suddenly one side stops charging and stops working.
It doesn't charge nor work. No response. Previous one stopped within my replacement period. This was just gone.
Update: I had a chat with the MI support team after Amazon recommended me to them. They fixed the issue by walking me through steps to reactivate the left bud. Hold button outside charging case for 20secs- without releasing button place inside the case(mine released for a second on placing it in..dint matter though) - hold it pressed even inside the case for a few seconds till you see RED light come back on. DONE! My faith in Mi restored!",1
1065,Very poor noise cancellation,"I owned it for around a month. Unfortunately the case of the earbuds got soaked in water in an accident and stopped working.
I liked the music of it till the time I owned it. The music was average, not the best and could best be heard upto 75% of volume. There was lot of distortion in sound at maximum volume.
The bass was average or almost not there at all.
The best part was it's connectivity. It rarely lost connectivity with my phone. But when it lost the connectivity I had to disconnect them from my phone and connect after a few seconds.
The worst part was it's noise cancellation. The environmental noise cancellation didn't work at all. There was more environmental noise than the recipient's voice. I couldn't use it for calls at all.
Overall an average piece and not worth spending ₹1799",3
1066,Worth the amount spend,"Go for it.. it's paisa vasool.
Amazed with the audio clarity and back up time.
They are small and light. We also get couple of ear tips to suit your ears. Earbuds sits perfect with no chances of it dropping.
Pairing is simple just remove from case and start to pair. It can be used with single bud also but to get true effect both must be used..
Easily should be able to get 3 and half hours + back up with one charge , volume with less than 50% is quite loud.
Buds when placed inside the box switches off and gets charged. Case can be charged with micro USB cable.
Call quality is great
Buds can also be powered off with long press

Buds to be placed properly in ear, do look for left and right, or else the sound quality gets poor exact placement will make it hear more n more or else you will hate and be sure with couple of tries you will get the exact placement.
Micro USB cable for charging, cable not included

Cons
Charging case lid looks a bit fragile hope it stays
Not sure as to how to check the status of case battery
Can't skip track or control volume",5
1067,Not perfect but couldn't ask more for the price!,"It been quite a while since I am using the product. I had only purchased this for use when at the gym or when running. I use Sennheiser 4.50 SE, Sennheiser CX180 and Sony WI 100 in my day to day activities, do check them out as they provide the best quality and value for the price. Coming to the review, they lack tuning. Sounds a little better with Dolby Atmos devices.
Pros-
1. Best Value for money
2. Sounds descent with Dolby Atmos devices
3. Splash proof
4. Pairs automatically when taken out of the case
5. Tactile button prevents shadow touch over
touch sensitive controls
6. Fits almost every ear size and is comfortable to
Wear
7. Gaming mode but not that great in latency test.
CONS-
1. Muddy and feeble sound as compared to more
expensive counterparts
2. Connection issues sometimes in the beginning
3. Can't connect to more than one device at a time
4. Not waterproof
5. Average battery life
6. Bad feedback to know if gaming mode is
enabled or disabled.
7.No AAC codec supported but not a great issue
8. International Manufacturing Standards- Safer
to prevent hearing loss.
Conclusion:- Only buy if your are really tight on budget or if you are going to use it as your secondary earpods like me. Can't complain because of the price.I hope Xiaomi tunes their budget earpods in better in the future.",3
1068,Poor sound,"Pretty impressive at this price point. Sound is average but considering the price we can't complain much. Pairing is seemless, after first pairing, you just have to take the earbuds out of case it will connect automatically within couple of seconds. Bass is average, if you are expecting thumping base then please consider buying some other earphones. Case and earbuds are little slippery so be careful while handling. All in all, good earphones at this price point, offcourse for true wireless, you have to compromise on sound.",1
1069,Worth for it's price!!,"Sound quality is pretty good and the low latency gaming mode also works great(Honestly, didn't expect the gaming mode would reduce any lag but it does).The battery lasts for about 3-4 hours as expected.I personally use this earbuds to watch movies, play music and to play PUBG and everything goes great with this earbuds.
The only con I found with this earbud is the mic quality, the person at the other end can hear you but distortion is always there.
I would not recommend this earbuds for calling but for day to day general tasks other than calling its great.

P.S: It's been more than a week since I bought this earbuds and everything works the same.Loved it!! :)",5
1070,Awesome product from Xiaomi and great job,"Just recieved the latest redmi earbuds s and I am really loving it .It is really light and looks great box is also looking beautiful and nicely placed in it
The sound quality is awesome I did play some music on it for about an hour and voice is very clear the bass is clear and the best part is it's very fast charging I really loved it and will buy few more if it soon .
I would give 5/5 for everything not a single issue behind it xiamoi has worked really hard on it and it's a great idea also the noise cancellation is also great
Over-all it's a must buy product and full value for money
Enjoy music and pub g where it gives low latency that's best for pub g lovers",5
1071,"Works amazingly well for PUBG only, not suitable if purchasing for making calls","Overall a pretty good device for this price range, good sound quality, quite loud, connects quicly, battery is good too .. once fully charged earbuds can be used for approx 3 hours and then it can again be recharged twice using the box and gets fully charged within 20 min. Have tried playing pubg using these, it was an amazing experience, no lag at all... PUBG lovers if you are looking for a wireless earphones for playing ( i was looking for it ), just go for it...u wont regret. The only thing i did not like about this device is when you are on calls, other person can't really hear you very well, maybe because the mic is far away, also after using it have noticed alot of disturbance while on calls(echo sound)",2
1072,"Great connectivity, poor sound quality.","If you want to listen to music and enjoy the dynamics of music then this is not the headphones you should get
If you want good connectivity to watch movies casually you can get this
and even the call quality wasn't great
for the price it is justified
get the Redmi Sonic Bass if you are looking for music quality not this one
and if you want a good TWS headphones to listen to music this is not the one get something better if music and quality is your priority",3
1073,For the price they are good pair of TWS..read my detailed review and decide,"Detailed review:

Build: The build is very good .The buds feel of good quality.Buttons are tactile.The box could have been made better.

Design: The design is good but for some reason I was not able to wear it continuously for more than 1 hr straight.Also for better audio experience try using a size less eartip if you can for better experience.

Audio: This is a mixed bag.The audio quality is great compared to the price.8/10 but bass is where the things are not so great.The earphones have bass but not the thumping bass.Also if by chance you did not wear it properly you won't even feel the bass.Loudness is good not great.100% here equals 80% of other earphones.But as they are TWS it's acceptable

Calls: The call quality is great.I have had no complaints while receiving or taking calls.The ENC feature is a misfit though..it captures outer sounds more instead of cancelling them..so not sure of the call experience in heavy traffic

Battery: Battery life is great as compared to the price

Clarification: I read some comments and here are some tips:

1) Audio in only 1 earbud: The TWS is designed to be on mini 1 ear mode on boot.If you want stereo both ear then press the button on the bud and it will pair together.Audio in both buds then.

2) Can't charge them: Make sure you remove all the tapes before using the product.

This is an original product.You can scratch the code and verify it on mi website.Its a 20 digit code which signifies authenticity

Cons: Most of the features wrt price are good.Here are some cons-
1) Most imp no charging cord provided in the box.
This charges via micro usb and now all phones are type c.Maybe you won't have micro usb.Hence cord should be bundled

2)Actions on clicking buttons are inconsistent , sometimes calls don't disconnect,songs don't pause,etc

3) No proper app to control the buds

4) No firmware updates

5) Packaging is very cheap.They feel some 100 rs earphones.Need to work on packaging.",4
1074,Those who can't afford Apple Airpods can buy with out next thought to Xiaomi Redmi earbuds S.,"As per my concern it's up to the mark for given price .
1. Sound , is good at this cost for earbuds era at these ₹:1799/- price.
2. Quality , Material and Case quality excellent at given price classic look and simple .
3. Weight , it is equal to Apple ear phones weight and compact in pocket carriage.
4. Value for money in earbuds section at these low price varient .

I have went on sereval reviews in youtube. Find satisfied with Redmi Earbud S.

Those who expecting extraordinary quality sound , don't buy this one. Don't compare with anyone of the earbuds because Xiaomi made these for those who can afford at these price.

I loved it's performance and price varient. Thanks Xiaomi ☺️☺️.",5
1075,Useless for Calls,"Rating the Product instead of Amazon Service which is 5star (timely delivery and Easy return)

The Bass and treble is balanced and sound quality is good and powerful enough for compact battery driven drivers. (4/5)
Battery backup is good (4/5)

Bluetooth range is better than Boat around 10m. there is a problem of connectivity
It keeps on refreshing for a few seconds and gets disconnected and reconnected.
Sometimes when connected with Bluetooth 4.0 on Laptop it stops working then you have to reconnect after turn off and on again. Its very annoying may be its due to backward compatible. (1/5)

But i had to return it because i bought it for calling not for music for transit because in lockdown there is no transit or gym.

The Reciever of the calls are always complaining about the modulated unnatural voice quality and its becomes unrecognizable most the time rendered it useless for calls. They are also complaining about Electronic sounds during the call.
Well its not just on Voip or Video calling apps but also on 3G calls also. (0/5)",1
1076,Just loved it...😍😍,"Look's, Sound, noise cancellation, everything is awesome at this price range...",5
1077,"Just an okay product. Detailed review, please read for more info.","Package contents of Redmi Earbuds 2C:

pair of earbud Redmi 2 c
additional ear tips (small and medium-size)
User manual

Redmi Earbuds 2C main highlights:

12 hours of music playback
Bluetooth 5.0
IPX4 water-resistant
Stylish and fashionable design
Multifunction button
Voice assistant
DSP ambient noise cancellation
Single or dual earbuds
Lightweight
Quick and easy to pair with the device

Redmi Earbuds 2C Battery Backup:

The Xiaomi company used the battery in the Redmi Earbuds 2C case is 300 mAh. Butt if you consider the battery in the earbuds separately then both of them have a 43 mAh battery.

The company claims that the Redmi Earbuds provide a battery backup of up 12 hours with a 2C charging case. So, when the earbuds are fully charged, then both earbuds provide up to 4 hours of playback/battery backup.

When using the Redmi Earbuds 2C continuously after a full charge, then if you use it at high volume then the buds gave up to 3 hours and 18 minutes of playback on a single charge.

If someone uses the earbuds at a volume level of 50-60%, then it gives you a playback time of 4 hours, which is quite reasonable.

Redmi Earbuds 2C Music Performance:

The Redmi Earbuds 2C has Bluetooth 5.0, which provides you a better wireless range of up to 18-20m. Bluetooth 5.0 provides a stable connection and better connectivity. Well, if you exceed the range then the connectivity will be lost.

If there is a crash between the smartphone and the Redmi Earbuds 2C, then the connection disrupts. The Bluetooth range is reduced to 8-9 meters when there is a wall or door or window present in between the smartphone and earbuds.

It doesn’t deliver deep bass and punch in the music when listening to multiple audio tracks. The user will get buzzing bass from the song. Redmi Earbuds 2C is fine for occasional purposes.

Redmi Earbuds 2C doesn’t deliver a good range of frequency when listening to music and you may not get a clear audio experience. If you are a music lover then this product might not be made for you.

Gaming Latency:

The Redmi Earbuds 2C works well when watching YouTube videos or movies on external video players. Well, Audio-video sync is fine for normal users.

But if you are a gamer then these earbuds are not for you. You may not find the up to the mark in terms of audio and video delay. When you are playing high-end games then you find some audio delay and it is considered as the biggest issue for gamers.

Pros and Cons:

Pros:
Good build quality
DSP ENC
Stylish and fashionable design
Voice assistant and IPX4 rating
Good audio performance
Cheap price

Cons:
No-touch control
Volume cannot be controlled with the earbuds button
You can’t change tracks with the earbuds button
The clarity of the sound is average
No charging cable in the box
Micro USB port for charging
For office meetings / calls over WebEx / Zoom, I do not recommend them at all as they don't deliver good
connectivity and clarity.

Conclusion:

If your budget is strictly under 1500 rupees then you can consider it however there are other option also. I would suggest you to look for brands also like Boat, Noise, Play etc. If you can extend you budget to 2000 or little more then you can get far better options. I returned them as I did not really like them.",3
1078,Budget buds.,"Fowwing points are important before buying..
1. Product is small & compact .
2. Buds are very light weight to wear.
3. Blutooth connectivity is excellent ..working more than 10 meters with very clearly but only in open are not conjusted with things.
4. I played music .sound is very clear & Bass is pretty excellent. But while during call , voice are distorted in middle .but mic connectivity is good.
5. Battery life is good ....ear buds upto 3 hours (while gaming ) but during calling , battery falls very sharply.
6. Case charging live longer up to 13 + hours.
7. There are buttons on ear buds , which helps easy to answering call ,game mode on , play music etc.
8. At a time ,you can connect this earbuds with two different devices....only that case when one is on stand by ...other for calls and vice versa .
9. Cost is very competitive with other brands .and offers very reasonable to buy .",4
1079,Value for money but leaves a lot to desire,"if you talk ease of use or comfort or style etc then the product is all ok and great value for money. Be assured that it doesnt drop from ears (the first suspicion of new guys coming from wired one).

Bought it for purpose of regular meetings but there seems to be many bottlenecks. for example battery dies within 4hrs and charging not so fast so it's not suitable for all day media listening kind but for meetings only. if ourltdoors then there would be complaints about low volume from the other side though at your side audio is crisp and clear",3
1080,Good product in this price but worst amazon delivery service.,"I am writing this review after my proper use of this product. Comparing to sound quality trust me I was totally shocked after listening it for the 1st time cause I did not accept this amazing sound quality in this price. The earbuds build quality is also good, completely plastic finish. The case can only charge your earbuds but it does not charge your phone cause its not case/power bank. Overall its good product to try once for basic use. If you want know the complete details please check out my video on my channel ""Eshan Tech World"". And obviously if this review is helpful pleas give it a thumbs up to support us.",4
1081,Read this before buying :,"Good for what you pay.

I have had few bluetooth devices ranging from RHA (8,000 Rs that lasted a year), Jabra 65 (still going good). I wanted a backup pair. So bought these. I had little to no expectations from these. But surprisingly they are and sound more than it's price.

Pros :
Decent sound quality.
Miniature Size.
Good battery life. (The Jay's M5/M7 still leading here).
IP rating is an added advantage.
Cons :
Uncomfortable fit (that's variable according to ear shapes).
Call quality is not good.

So to summarize : If you are looking for a Bluetooth Solution purely for calling better buy the Oneplus Z (almost same price + better battery + USB C +quick charge). Else you can buy them.",3
1082,Bang for the Buck,"I am writing after using this for a week. The buds are light weight and fit well, comes with additional 2 set of plugs. Its very easy pair with he mobile. Call can be taken till 10-15 feet without issues. The sound quality is nice, clear and without distortions. I have used it for 5 hours continuously.Sometimes calls are not very clear, mostly when battery is low.

Overall a very good bargain for the price, go for it.

I bought it from this seller, they shipped it very fast; https://amzn.to/2YzIzKY",4
1083,Don't buy it!!!,"I have bought this eardots as I have a redmi note 7 pro. But I regret after buying this. It's a pathetic product and couldn't be used other than listening to music. You can not wear it for long like more than 1 hr, it hurts your ear.
Forget to play pubg as the sound lags significantly even in low latency mode(llm). llm is good for video playback but even the video playback lags in normal mode.
You can not either wear it to the gym as the chip inside the earpods move inside the buds and produce sounds.
Battery backup and sound quality are ok.",1
1084,Worth for money.,"Writing this after using for 5 days. Decent sound quality. No problem in connectivity. Range is also good.
Low latency mode works great. Tested while playing Call of Duty. Almost no lag.

Cons:
Microphone is not great. There's always noise at the other end when I am calling.
No option for ""Next Song""
When listening to music, Volume level bar randomly appears sometimes without doing anything.
There's no option to increase or decrease volume. But you can double tap and say ""increase volume"" and google assistant will do it.
3 pairs of eartips are given. But for me, the small one is too small and medium sized one is too big. Sometimes falls out of the ear.",4
1085,Value Buy with user friendly features in the price range,"Another good product from Xiaomi.
Considering current WFH and Online Schooling situation, one of the key criteria was ability to mute and unmute from the earbuds
You are able to mute and unmute from the earbud by double tapping the multi function button during the call.
Did'nt find this function in quite a few earbuds that I checked and compared
As well as the 12 hours of standby time is good.

Happy with the purchase.",5
1086,Excellent offerings at a very competitive price!,"I had ordered these on launch day itself and received the delivery within a day. Since then I have tested it extensively and you should gear in for a fairly long review about every detailed aspect of it.
1. Look and Feel:
The case of the Redmi Earbuds S has a curved rectangle design with a matte black finish. Redmi branding is on the top of the case and in the side panel hosts a MicroUSB port. Overall, the case looks bit bulky but is light weighted and easy to carry.
Earbuds look like pebbles and have an in-ear design which fit snugly inside the ear canal and are quite different from Mi wireless Earphones 2 or Realme Buds Air Neo. The buds have a physical button on top of them to initiate different actions. They are comfortable to wear and carry if you choose the ear tip as per the size of your ear canal from the set of three provided in the box.
Earbuds have an LED under the surface too, which blinks only when charging when ready to pair and not noticeable.
2. Features:
The Redmi Earbuds S come with IPX4-rating and helps it in surviving in drizzle and sweat during the workout. It support Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and has 7.2mm drivers.
Earbuds S have a low-latency gaming mode which is quite handy while watching videos or movies. I tried playing PubG using the low latency mode and felt that the output was pretty decent but it cannot match the wired headphones quality.
3. Controls:
Redmi Earbuds comes with multi-function physical button which is easy to use and click sound it produced when pressed is pleasing to hear. As far as the actions are concerned, a single click will allow you to answer a call or to hang up at the end and a long press will reject the call. Clicking at any other time will play or pause audio or video. If you click twice preferred voice assistant on your device will be launched. In my case, Google assistant was summoned and I used it for managing volume, changing track inside the music app and asking a few relevant questions to keep Assistant busy. I also had the choice of selecting Alexa which should also work fine.
4. Sound Quality:
Since the earphones have an in-ear design, I was very pleased with the bass response. Vocals were decent at around 80 percent volume but anything above resulted in a slight deterioration of the sound quality. Audio quality during calls was good for me, with no complaints from the recipient side as well. I did not encounter any call drops within the 10-meter range beyond which I heard a click sound and audio dropped off as it was out of range.
5. Battery Performance:
I have not yet extensively tested the battery but on a full charge, I was able to watch a 3.5 hours movie with still some juice left. Redmi claims that one can get 4 hours on a single charge and with the case, one can easily get about 10-12 hours. When I charged the case it took around two hours to charge completely.
Final Verdict:
Redmi Earbuds S are one of the cheapest Buds out there in The Market. Redmi has used micro USB port and Physical button to reduce the cost of TWS but I felt Touch button is much better than the touch interface. The performance of Redmi Earbuds will not disappoint you and in-ear design is a good differentiating factor to have to stand away from the rest of the earbuds. Also the sound quality with a thumping bass alongwith very good battery backup for a TWS earbuds are right up there in the positives list. So I would suggest you to definitely go for them without any second thoughts.",5
1087,Too much of expectations but not worthy product.,"Just used it for hours & figured boat are far better then this.
Watched many reviews & decided to buy it but not worth.
Pros: light weight, just ok sound quality no high base (which is what I like)

Cons:
It's mat finish makes it a very slippery product.
The buttons needs to be pressed very hard which causes pain in ears.
No song change option. This is a basic need, if you want to change a song looking for the phone. (Dounle-tap activates Google, single pause paly, 3 tab some gaming mode that's all)
There was a rattle sound from the buds & when they are kept for charge there is a sound coming if it's moved a bit.
Feels very cheap don't feel premium at all (looks premium though)
There is a sound from left earbud everytime you play/pause which is very annoying.
Not sure these are durable at all.
If you plan to buy this stretch your budget & go for boat. They look & feel a lot better then this & music is no match at all.",1
1088,excellent product go for it,"all specifications are good in this earbuds S
vocal music is crystel clear
easy to pair
low latency mode excellent working in pubg
very tiny easy to carry
make sure buy some earbud pouch to protect from scratches
light weight
bass is average
call mic quality is good
noise cancellation is average
earbud battery backup 3.5 hours
plz dont use while travelling driving or walking on the roads its too much riskey
this is honest review as per my experience...its better than ptron and realme products.
enjoy the music stay safe stay home...",5
1089,Attractive due to price point BUT Worthless!,"Pros-
1- The price point is low
2- You get a feel of TWS earbuds
3- Lightweight
Cons-
1- Decent sound
2- Poor call quality
3- Gets paired even after putting in case, so I had to turn them off or turn my phone Bluetooth off to avoid pairing
4- Pathetic noise cancellation - People have complained that we can listen everything but you
5- Pain in ears after using for 2-3 hours ( despite changing ear tips)
NOTE- Dont go by Youtube reviews, they are not thorough, i got influenced by them only. If you just want to experience how TWS feels, you have 2-3 hours usage per day and no calling, ONLY then go for mi earbuds.",1
1090,Not for calling,"The sound quality is good as per the price range, but the call quality sucks. The other person complains alot for voice. I tried it with iPhone as well as samsung s9 and redmi k20 pro, but works the same way everywhere.
Secondly, the range is not good enough. If you keep the phone in pocket and put your hand on the buds, the sound stops.

If you want better call quality, go for other ones. If just sound is the focus, buy cheaper ones like portronics etc.",1
1091,"Original, good quality wireless earphones.","Its a new launch and I got it for my wife's Redmi Note 4 but it should pair with any Bluetooth phone..

The case has 300Mah battery which is good enough and charges earphones when they're inside storage case. The case has a MicroUSB charging point, but no cord is supplied in the package. Red means charging is going on. A white (or off) light while charging means full charge is done.

Both earphones have one multipurpose button which is used for accepting, rejecting call and play/ pause music among other things.

First time pairing is very easy, no passcodes. Take out earphones, switch on BT and discover and pair them.
Then on, you connect by only taking out the earphones from the case. Inside case, the earphones switch off BT. Single earphone mode is also there if you remove one earphone only from the case.

The package has Charging case, 2 earphones, 3 sets of rubber earplugs with M size installed, and user guide.

I'll write my review pointwise about the earphones' working:-
1. Very comfortable in ears, very light too,
2. There's no perceptible difference between Left and right channel, both play with Stereo, without delay in equal volume,
3. There's a very slight delay between audio and video when watching videos or playing games, this can be further removed by engaging Gaming mode, then it becomes ok,
The delay is ok for movies, you might not even feel the delay. Its like 0.1 seconds or so I think in normal usage.

Negatives:
1. Mic is a bit far, but for real life it works nicely. Voice is loud and clear in normal calls,
2. you can't use the mic for recording video/audio, its only for calls, so far what I've noticed, but it could be a software thing too with our phone which has very old software, not updated.

Now coming to sound quality. Due to senior bluetooth air pods (Rs. 4500~) in market, I didn't have much expectations from sound quality of this junior Redmi S earphones, but this was a little surprise, the quality is actually ok for the typical music fan, who's not a die hard audiophile...
If you listen to music while travelling, or casually, once in a while, you're going to be very satisfied with the audio quality. Maximum volume is just right, it can get loud, keep it at 80%.

If you're an audiophile, let me put it in your terms, the lower(bass) and upper (treble) frequencies are slightly higher, and the midrange frequencies are weaker... Be prepared for louder hissing sort of sounds in treble frequencies. Stereo separation is ok, but the dynamic range itself is not too high. Distortion is as such not noticeable to the common ear.
Comparing to wired earphones, the quality is better than Mi earphones basic (Rs. 400), but not better than Mi Dual Driver earphones (costing Rs. 799) or Rs. 699 ones either.
Overall, they're good for calls and general listening, like audio lectures and so. Its not a serious tool for an audiophile, but have average expectations and they'll do good.

Ask questions in comments and I'll answer if I get notification of this...",5
1092,"Bakwas.. not at all a ""value for money"" product!","Hello all,

I would like to have a ""15-days review"" of Xiaomi's new Earbuds 'Redmi Earbuds S' after around 15 days of intense usage:

Pros:
1. Sleek design, easy to fit and firm grip😌

3. Long battery😌

Cons:
1. Poor connectivity options😥
2. Can connect only one device at a time😫
3. No auto-shutdown option😴
4. Loss of connectivity in-between of operation
5. Disastrous button control😒

8. USB B-type charger (no C-type😖)
9. Switching from one device to another is pathetic experience😖
10. Last but not least ""Made in China"" product😫😡😠

Ultimately, its probably the cheapest earbuds in Indian market, but it's literally ""A cheap product""!🤦🤦🏻‍♂️

Be cautious while choosing your gadgets!😯🙏",2
1093,after use of 5 days,"sound quality is good and is pocket friendly product,
✔sound quality 🌟= 4 out of 5

❌automatically disconnect after that connect in 1 sec.
❌do not drop it.",3
1094,I’d recommend these,"These are the first true wireless I’ve purchased so I don’t really have anything to compare it with. The sound is great, good bass, good noise cancellation (I almost got hit by a car cause I was walking on the road and didn’t hear the horn. Adhere to their advice of wearing just one while on the road 😬). There’s definitely connectivity issue but it’s rare. Seldom while using both together, using single will definitely lag occasionally. Also, these can be used while walking, running or doing high intensity workouts, they fit snug and won’t fall off for sure. They do last 3.5-4 hours on a single charge. I’d recommend these if on a tight budget.",4
1095,Defective & duplicate item,"Dont waste your money,amazon seller sent me defective one,then i asked for return and refund but amazon guy assured me to get it if replacement order will also be defective but after getting replacement item that also stopped working just after 7days & now amazon denying for return or refund as per its policy 7days time gone.Smart marketing policy.When i went to Xiaomi local service center they said its a duplicate one.Lost my 1299₹😭 Now a days even heard on news that amazon selling fake products. I lost my trust on amazon.",1
1096,Better options available even at lower price,"Noise cancellation: it mutes the mic completely when user isn't speaking. That's the idea of noise cancellation here. But this doesn't work in noisy areas like Railway station.

Sound quality: It's only for those who want to take calls. It's not at all for music lovers. Still there are other options at lower price if you want it just for calls.",2
1097,Pathetic (Pathetic (Pathetic (pathetic.......n+1))),"1st time reviewing a MI product like this. Pathetic sound quality. Poor connection. Ultimate level of discomfort to ear. Although battery backup is good.
Probably the least researched or least tested Redmi product so far. Company should take action against the team which made this ₹1800 trash. And aslo for defaming brand value. Must take return this craps. Very very very much disappointed.
I will next time surely think twice before purchasing any Redmi product. I won't buy blindly like this one I bought by it's brand value.

If possible take it back (Redmi) and give me a good one after correction.
I am utterly disappointed.
No thank you.",1
1098,Value for money,"Overall nice product for the price. Form factor is great as it is small and light weight. Matt finish looks great on the earphones and the case. Comes with 3 different size of eartips, so easy to find your fit.
Sound quality is alright. Not very good as can be expected at this price point. So these are not the best choice to enjoy your music. Convenience is its greatest advantage as you can pop the earbuds in your ear wherever and whenever. I think these are best for watching videos, playing games and using during workouts.
Calling experience is ok. The mic is not the best but it gets the job done as the other party can hear you with this clearly without any issues. Conveniently especially during long calls as you do not have to hold your phone to your ears.
Connectivity could be better. Despite this being a bluetooth 5 device, it connects to 1 device at a time. This is cumbersome as if you need to connect your phone and this earbud automatically pairs with your laptop, for example on coming out of the case, you either need to disconnect the earbud from your laptop manually or reset the earbud which takes around 20 sec everytime. Sometimes it lags while playing a video and sometimes it disconnects itself but those are not major issues.
Battery is ok.",4
1099,Gift for my dad,"I have bought this for my dad and he is happy with it. Audio is not hitting loud hurting ears and not bass heavy. This is recommended for parents who love melody music.

Call quality is ok ok and earbuds are lose you need to check if they're charging or not by simply placing in the case the pins didn't align in my case and manget is not strong for connecting pins and the buttons are a bit hard on click.

On the best part it is easy to connect and haven't found any lag on daily usage except gaming. You can use single bud also that's nice and I got 3.5 hours of Play time with buds. On the other side of coin the case looks cheap and felt like it won't last long as plastic is too thin on the opening side and it has micro usb and no fast charge.

I would say it's worth buying at 800-900 if you get best deal at festive season and not worth in the range at1300/-",4
1100,"Cheap, inferior quality product from Redmi","Cheap, inferior quality product by Redmi.
The earbud are super light(which is good) but the connectivity is bad. There is always a blaring sound in between the audio. The sound is sometimes wavy or even cracked. No guarantee.

I have to buy 3 earbus to ensure I had a good one and even the third earbud was the same.

Don't go for this product. Instead go for skullcandy or sennheiser. You will be satisfied. I bought a skullcandy sesh and it works like a charm.

Redmi is no more like how it used to be before. Its become worse than micromax also.",1
1101,Good product,"Pros
It has excellent build quality, design and I give it 10/10

The sound quality is excellent and I give it a 8/10

The battery life last very long around 3 to 4 hours just by using the earbuds without the backup charge and I give it 9/10

They are very portable and fits nicely into your ear.

They are seamless to connect to devices

Cons

The earbuds are very easy to lose, if you are not careful

The case cover is loose, it could result it bring separate

The noise canceling feature does not remove a majority of background noise as it was promised

Overall this product is great for its price point",4
1102,A good and dependable earphone for the price,"Very dependable product, I am using it with various devices including Asus zenphone, acer aspire 5 laptop, FiiO Hi-Res audio player. The Bluetooth connection switches b/w devices seamlessly. The bass is amazing covers the whole audible spectrum ranging from 200Hz down to 15Hz. The trebble is a little less, the frequency goes up to 15000 Hz although beyond 15000 upto 20000 the volume gets faint for me and barely audible. Comparing with Dr Dre Power beats 3 that I own, the over all sound seems to be muffled and seems to be comming from a small speaker yet has better base than Dre. Dre seems like u r sitting in a hall listning to music. The connectivity is also good compared to Power beats 3. I absolutely love the charging feature and if u r careful u will never be out of battery and I will easily use this earphone over a wired one any day, although Dre ones could give me 1 hour backup for 5 mins of charge but Redmi seems more user friendly and charging involves less hassle. There is one down side of Redmi earbuds is that it will fall off while chewing food or while running so u would have to keep adjusting them. I have been using these earphones since 2 months now.",4
1103,A decent wireless earbuds for the budget. Fits great.,"I was looking for a budget set of wireless and these redmi ones looked pretty decent. The product came in proper packaging and the casing is very good. These fit my ears really good unlike the other expensive ones from apple and oneplus i have(i lose them frequently). The sound quality is not that great for this price range but it definitely serves the purpose. This is first week impression of these earbuds.

Pro:
Amazing fit
Sweat proof
Good battery life
Good casing
Easy to connect with android
Inexpensive

Cons:
bass not that great.
Just black color.

I might buy them again.",5
1104,Worst product,"Don't go for this product I hurt my ear it pains a lot after 1 hour of usage I take it back this was my worst choice ever, I finally returned the product and got my refund thnx for Amazon and going forward to not purchase any MI products I suggest everyone not to buy cause this product is totally defuct and not a finished product",1
1105,Classy Ear Buds.,"First thanks to amazon because of its nice packing and delivered before the date. I have received earbuds without Damage. These earbuds build quality is awesome.

First, i charged it completely, and then I started to use it. Its fits well in my ear and sound quality are good at even 80 per cent. According to budget its luxury product.

Whenever I drive the car, I miss once. So I feel very good after this earbuds. It gives me 5 hours of battery time.

:- 1) Good battery backup.
2) classic design
3) Looking so pretty.
4) Charging in less than one hour.
5) Amazing bass.

Finally Thanks to Amazon....",5
1106,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAYS FOR !!!,"First of all, I don't write reviews to convince people to buy products. I just brought this product a week ago and I'm sharing my experiences through this review. You can decide to buy this product or not but that's all up to you. why I'm writing this review is to help you with your purchase decision. so let's break it down:

1. sound quality - good for the price. expect a sound quality from a 400 to 500 rupees wired
earphone.
2. call quality - call quality is not good. for the price it is acceptable. if you are planning to use this
for call in a noisy environment then you have to scream.
3. connectivity - connectivity is ok. after the first pairing it will become very easy to connect with
your phone, the moment you take out the earphones from the charging case it
will immediately connect with your phone. if you cover the earphone with your
hand, while you are listening to the connection, will break but it will reconnect
immediately.
4. Controls - I have a mixed feeling on how this earbud can be controlled. For me using physical
button is way easier because the funny thing is I can use my shoulder to control. the
buttons are easily clickable. but the thing I don't like is ""you cant skip music"" that is
very annoying. We can use the buttons to enable the game mode, play/pause music,
and activate google assistant/Siri.

4. battery life - I don't wanna talk about the company claimed battery life. Let's talk about the
battery life I got. since the day I got this earphone I charged it fully and started
using it. Every day I used it for 1 to 1.45 hours continuously without using the
charging case and I got a complete battery life of 4 days(using case).

conclusion: -
Under this 2000 rupees price range u don't have an alternative. realme buds q is not on a stable price
and sells for 2300 to 2400 price range. if u can get one under 2000 you can buy one if you want to.
There are many negative reviews on this product I don't know why they are posting this kind of
negative reviews.
All i want was convinence and redmi earbuds s fullfills it.",4
1107,Good device for the price,"My immediate first impressions of the truly wireless earbuds are quite good actually. The sound quality is decent and connectivity is great. For a price less than 2K one cannot expect the build quality to match those of Apple's or Samsung's.

It's comfortable to wear for long calls and gaming mode(which you get by pressing the physical button 3x) is quite good and has a low latency rate.

Battery life is quite decent as well. Last longer than I expected, if it were a type C port then would have been great since most of the device around me are having type c connectivity.

Overall a good buy for the give price bracket. Not really much to complain.",5
1108,Bit overpriced for the quality of product,"It's difficult to divide it in pros and cons.
1. Connectivity: Bluetooth connectivity is good, range is pretty good. Pairing is easy. Buds gets paired almost instantly with device as well as with each other.

2. Sound: Not good. Loudness is missing completely ( changed earbuds of all sizes),
Bass is not that great( with the price being paid).
Would have better if these were priced at around 1-1.1k max.
Music lovers please don't go for it, all sounds get mixed up and you get that cracking sound when lots of instruments are being played.

3. Call quality: Mic works okayish, but the person on the other side won't feel comfortable with voice, some kind of noise is constantly present( checked in quiet room)",2
1109,It delivered what it promised,"Sound quality - 5/5
Bass quality - 4/5 : It's not that much but it is effective.
Noise cancellation - 4/5 : It's decent. It cannot cancel a very high background noise but that is normal.
Connectivity - 5/5 : It's Bluetooth so it need to adhere to the stands of bluetooth.
Battery - 5/5 : It says 4 hours on a singly charge & it did.
Both earbuds can work individually which is really great if you are trying to get things done with low battery situation.
I don't see any cons with this. May be because of the price range.",5
1110,Pretty Good earbuds for the price,"Got this earphones few days back,
I was waiting for it.

Very good fit and amazingly light.
The design is Simply awesome.
Build quality is Nice.

Battery Backup nice.

Noise cancellation is Nice.

Paired pretty Quickly for both double n single.

I like the Sound Quality.
It's clear and punchy bass.
Not that loud but not complaining

one star less because sometime struggling with connection in a call",4
1111,DON'T buy this. It's a cheap Chinese product,"Got this at price of 1099. Expected to be a good deal. But... The buds were having noise distortion. Also it was having continuous connection disconnection issue. So I went for replacement.

The new piece came. The noise distortion is reduced. I was feeling happy. But within 1 hour of usage, left ear bud just stopped working. I thought that charge might have gone. so I put it in charging case. There are no lights even when connected to case. Left ear bud had gone completely dead. I have a nokia bluetooth headset (mono) which was working for more than 5 years (only battery backup have gone to an hour or so)

So I'm returning it. What if this goes dead after warranty period? I know Xiaomi customer care- they will find thousand reasons not to give warranty. (Like some scratches on body etc.) Also redmi logo is on charging case only and not on earbuds.

This was a cheap Chinese crap. don't buy this guys. Xiaomi once entered indian market providing quality products. Once established, they are now dumping all low quality products into India.

To all those 5 star rating people, maybe they got a good piece, but the two pieces I got were defective. Amazon ratings of this product :- 5star is 36% and 1star is 24% , simply means atleast 20% is defective(both my pieces was defective , so everyone might have replaced it once. Meaning number of defective pieces are doubled )
So again don't buy, You will regret it later.",1
1112,Call quality is pathetic but sound is good,"Though music experience is very good , call quality is pathetic , not good at all. So , if you just want to buy this for only music and movies , u can buy but not for calls. You can't use these earbuds while wearing helmet, bluetooth will not work. But they are very good fit in ears.
Overall, If you are just looking for music , u can buy these or else skip buying easily.",3
1113,Sound quality is bad . No battery indicator,"Sound quality is bad. Don't buy
Low quality calling China made . Cheap",1
1114,The best bluetooth headphone I have ever used,"What an amazing headphone by Mi . I was looking for a budget headphone for a long time and finally a brand I trust has completed my search. For the price of 1299 it's a bang for every buck . Used it straight for 3 hours , no ear ache. Voice is good for indoor use. Perfect lightweight companion for movies and music. Tested out in my gym , did not fall easily . Base is good. bluetooth connection works fine. I have not tested Battery backup but use it to watch a whole movie , will update about full charge run time. Currently in the market I don't think I can get anything better than this. Totally recommended for anyone looking for budget bluetooth headphone.",5
1115,Cool ear buds for regular use!!,"I found this earbuds in the amazon sale, I am using redmi brand phone so preferred to buy the same brand earbuds. It doesn't disappointed me. The sound quality, bass effect and nice cancellation was equivalent to the top brands earbuds. The design of the case was simply superb, compact to handle and the earbuds was well coupled inside the box, there is no chance for accidentally falling out.

I received the device, put it on charge and took out the earbuds from the box and the device name was instantly populated on my mobile and it got paired easily. I was about to play music and receive call, the experience was hassle free.

Both the earbuds sits properly in the ears, and its not slipping out which helps me to use them at gym during workout.",5
1116,Great Product and worth the price,Its a great product amd complete value for money package. It fits perfectly in your ear hand holds quite well even when you're running or working out. The sound quality is very good and doesn't irritates you if you are listening to music for very long also. The battery backup and charging both of the things are quite good and you can listen to music for long time. O would definitely recommend it.,5
1117,Totally worth it!,"I'm not a guy who defends the brand but to be very Frank it's awesome the only con is we can't see the battery percentage of the case and the right and left buds that's the con but everything is awesome bass,vocals and others are clear and loud...

And they didn't include Micro USB in the packaging that's the con for Type-C users :(",5
1118,Effective and light weight earbuds but ofcourse low cost implies buggy features,"Used for 3 days and posting review
Pros:
1. Cost
2. Sturdy material for charging case and matte finish
3. Punchier sound is good for indian music
4. Very very light and doesn't give any pain in the ear(i use jaybird run and it is very heavy)
5. Both earbuds are in sync for calls - single earbud can be used for music and calls if other one switches off

Cons:
1. Calls have a lot of disturbance - buggy
2. Sometimes when it is already connected, it still gives pairing sound
3. Sometimes it gets frequent interruptions with sound stopping for every other second
4. Mentioned Low Latency 122ms but still seems to be nearly 350ms
4. No proper charging indication outside the box.

Overall: Definitely budget earbuds but if you feel the bugginess and issues in first two days itself",3
1119,Average quality earbuds,"I am using this earbuds from couple of days. These are the things I would like to share with you.

Pros:
- really light weight
- good Bluetooth connectivity
- led indicator on charging
- compatible with both iPhone and Android
- charging case is very compact and looks good.

Cons:
- audio quality is below than average
- multi functional button cannot be used to increase or decrease volumes and cannot switch to next music track.
- buttons are little harder to press
- no noise cancellation
- overpriced ( could be somewhere 1000 rs )

Final thoughts:
- Buy this earbuds only is you want to try some earbuds for cheaper price ( as this is cheapest option available now ). But the audio quality is much lesser than the mi basic earphones.",2
1120,SPECIFICALLY FOR GAMING REVIEW (PUBG),"This is specifically for people wondering if these earphones will work for PUBG mobile.
The answer is ""NO"".
*I faced latency on my Moto G5s. This might be because my Bluetooth version is 4.2 but i do have aptx on my phone.
*You might face less latency on better phones but if you have a low end mobile phone please do not consider buying them for gaming.
*The other problem being the quality of sound in the game. The earphones loudness and sharpness affects the gameplay majorly. Its not very easy to recognise footsteps or even direction of bullet fire.
OTHER THAN GAMING ITS GREAT IN EVERY ASPECT.",3
1121,Good for listing music but poor calling quality.,"If you are buying this for just listening music or watching video on YouTube or for multimedia usage it's fine but if you are buying this for calling then I'll suggest this is not the product you are looking for, It's sound quality is good you can hear the person you are talking to but the person on the other side will complaint that your voice is not clear or they are hearing eco.
Also the lid of the case is fragile so you have to handle with care.
Connectivity is fast, within 2-3 sec as you took them out of the case, it get connected to your phone and both the earbuds get paired with each other.",3
1122,Sound is above average but issues in call quality,"Been using the buds for more than a month now and below are my observations-
1. The sound is okay, you enjoy the sound when there is no external sound disturbing you.
2. The call quality is not up to the mark. I'm not sure this is a latency issue or what but while talking the voice cutting down every 2-3 seconds. Also, it was catching a lot of noise from outside than the caller.
3. The battery life is okay. 3-4 hours.
This was my first experience in TWS section will have to research a lot before moving towards another one.
If you're on a tight budget you can give it a try or look realme buds.",3
1123,Not for an Audiophile (honest review),"The only color that they do come in unfortunately is Black, I wish they would have offered one in white too, because that's the color that really stands out and will look really good with a light color device.
Starting with the unboxing experience, packaging is typically what can be expected from Mi similar to their other accessories like power bank and normal earphones. The product comes with a User Manual and extra set of Eartips for making it a perfect fit. I wonder why they haven't added a USB charging cable along with the product which they usually offer with their other products.
The product looks premium and light weight comparing to the other earbuds in this price segment.
Right after poping the case up, instantly you will realise that the latch is not magnetic and doesn't offer with that clicking satisfaction sound that comes from the AirPods case which really signifies the level of quality of the product. The earbuds looks exactly the same size as Mi earphones. The holes for microphone doesn't look appealing at all, looks a flaw in the design of the shell. Considering the size of the case it looks a perfect fit comparing with other wireless earbuds.

Connecting with your pair of Android device is a bit of a hefty task as it doesn't include the W1 chip offered by Apple for smooth pairing or the way Samsung has also implemented the same with their Earbuds for smooth pairing experience. While it takes 3 seconds for you to connect your Airpods to your iDevice it will takes around 15-20 seconds to get your pair of Redmi Earbuds S to connect to your device. So to pair the device you need to press the button on the back on the buds till the red light turns to blinking white which turns on the pairing mode.
There are no sensors to detect the movement hence they will continue to keep playing the audio even when you take them out.
Although, it's a pair of in-ear buds but you will still be able to hear a lot of background noise maybe it's due to the typical shape of the buds. The base is synthetic and flat and you won't hear any deep bass, even listening to pop songs only provides with clear vocals and no music. The quality of the audio is similar to the output that you get from a mobile phone speaker. They do get louder but I won't recommend playing them over 75% volume. I think the main idea for Xiaomi to come up with these is to attend calls and conferences because that's the only thing they can be used for. Battery life looks amazing in figures but after an actual use you will realize that that's not the case at all and you will end up charging them 5-6 times in a week.

Don't go for these if you are on audiophile. Mi Earphones costing Rs.399 sounds far better than the Earbuds S.",2
1124,Good product for the price point,"I bought this pair of earbuds about two months back and after using it for this duration, I can put forth an honest review of the product.

First thing first, the delivery service of Amazon was quick. The product fits nice in-ear and is very easy to use. The sound quality is decent but during calls sometimes it feels that the voice oscillates from one end to the other (meaning it sounds like mono and then all of a sudden feels like a stereo effect). The noise cancellation is good as I have used many a times while in a moving car and there is clarity of voice. Besides that, the battery life is also good and lasts long.
The flip sides of this product is that at times it becomes very difficult to take out the buds from the case as the lid interfere. In all a good product to have and easy to use.
Ah! one last comment - the buds are durable. Have slipped out of my hand a number of times without any damage.",4
1125,Decent quality for the price,"A good compact pair of buds. Very easy to pair. Can pair with one device at a time. (I can use it with my phone and tab, but not at the same time).
The charge lasts a pretty long time for me, more than the advertised duration of 3-4 hours.
Sound quality is good, not very loud, no extra bass. Sufficient in my opinion.
I had a problem one time where both the buds did not sync with each other, so the left one was not working. But YouTube solved that problem.
Overall, I'm happy with these buds.",4
1126,DEFECTIVE ITEM DELIVERED AND SEAL WAS OPEN,"I WAS AMAZED THAT IT GOT DELIVERED WITHIN 12 HOURS ..BUT I KNEW SOMETHING WAS FISHY.
THE BOX WAS ALREADY OPENED NOT SEALED AND WAS DAMAGED.
AND WHEN I TRIED TO PAIR THE EARBUDS..ONLY LEFT ONE GOT PAIRED..RIGHT ONE WASN'T WORKING.. IT'S NOT EVEN CHARGING..I HAVE POSTED THE PICTURES..THIS SELLER IS A SCAM..I ORDERED A REPLACEMENT..IF THAT ALSO COMES DEFECTIVE AND OPENED. I WILL SUE THIS RETAILER.
EDIT : GOT THE REPLACEMENT DELIVERED TODAY I.E. THE VERY NEXT MORNING.. IT WORKS NOW.. THOUGH IF U LOOKING FOR A GOOD QUALITY MUSIC EARBUDS.. THIS PROBABLY AINT IT UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE EQUALIZER SETTINGS.. BECAUSE THE DEFAULT QUALITY IS FLAT AUDIO..",3
1127,Roadside Quality MI disappointed for the first time,"The moment you open the package, it's nothing but a disappointment . The box is fragile and looks cheap and could break any minute, so are the buds. Sound is horrible. I'm normally a MI advocate using band all versions from 1 to 4, MI scale, phone and water purifier and that's the reason I bought it on the day it was relased but this product so bad and disappointing. Returned it immediately.",1
1128,Best Product,"the best true wireless earphones under 2k, even if they 3k in India , I would say it’s worth it.
Advantage -
1. Vocals sound amazing ! Highs , mids , awesome !
2. These are really small and very compact, when I got these in my hands I feel good with this tiny phone!
3. The fit is perfect, you can’t even feel it in your ears. These are so cute.
4. In Gaming it amazingly sound work ! I’ve tried the other brand buds air and I’ve got to say these are on point to it. Playing games are flows very smoothly, giving a lag free gaming experience.
5. Connectivity is also amazing.
I have been using this product for the last 2 days and here is my opinion on it.
The battery backup is good. The battery lasts 3-4 hours on regular mode . The build quality is good. The sound is the best under 2k. I've used many earbuds under 2k But these are so awesome.",5
1129,poor design & bad fit,"has connectivity issue connecting with my bluetooth 4.0 enabled android device. their is a pause every ten seconds, i connected with an iphone works ok. the battery backup is average, low grade plastics. moreover it fits so bad like it has to sit perfectly in the ear shape ,but these look like grey market unbranded product. seriously something is wrong with xiaomi's design team . do not buy this. go with realme or other brand",1
1130,Good for the price paid.,"Very good ear buds. Not a lot about them mentioned on the site. I took help from You tube eventually & it's good just battery back for buds as given 4 hrs is not true, it's hardly 2-3 he's but depends on loud sound & bass also maybe because of that.
But the best thing is Amazon's service which as always is superb as when I first received the set only one ear bud was in it & I raised replacement request with missing part & it was immediately replaced. So hats off to amazon as always.",5
1131,Good to buy in this pricing,"After using this for past few days I am writing this review as this is the new launch by mi and I am using this with mi note 5 pro and I realised the following points:
- bluetooth connectivity is strong
- not so heavy and light on ears
- comfortable and fits well
- sound quality is also good not like others.
- good for streaming purpose but I do prefer wired for calling purpose.
- battery backup is just awesome

So after seeing the above point I think it's good to have it.",4
1132,Best buy in this price range,"Pros:-
1). Best earbuds in this price range
2). No touch option - I consider this as advantage because we usually happen to adjust these types of earbuds a lot times without interrupting our music. We get a soft touch button instead.
3).we can use these earbuda in mono or single mode which is best advantage...while we just listen to youtube or want to be more sensible to the voices in surrounding this function helps a lot as we can use single earpiece also battery consumption lasts upto more than 4 hours of we use single at a time
4). Google assistant and Siri works perfect
5). Voice clarity on call is awesumn

Cons:-
1). Volume cannot be adjusted with earpiece
2). Gaming mode is good however I faced a problem of echo sound while playing pubg
3). No matter how good they fit in ears they have a chance of falling from ear",4
1133,Stopped working in 6 months. Poor product. Please avoid.,"Pros:
- Good battery life
- Automatic pairing works well
- Case quality is decent

Cons:
- Constant crackling and humming sound on the earbuds when silent (tried with two different pairs), very irritating
- Cannot connect to 2 devices at once (almost all BT earphones allow this)
- Poor bass, noisy sound signature.
- Exhibits connection issues with certain windows 10 laptops.
- Need i go on?

Not the type of product I expected from Mi.
Rs.1800 is big money, should have been better quality. Crackling and humming sounds when idle is unacceptable quality. Thumbs down.",1
1134,Super product,"Received and used for few hours. Calling clarity is good. Other party can clearly hear you. Music performance too is good. Deep bass. Easy pairing. When a call comes you can just take out the bud and place in ur ear, meanwhile device will be connected. So far so good.. stays in the ear easily. A wonderful device for the given price tag! Biggest con: Can connect with only one phone at a time.",5
1135,Pathetic battery backup: Not suitable for long-term use,"The design is lightweight and compact, just as described. Personally I didn't like the button feature, and there's also no way to skip songs as is available in Boult Audio Combuds.

However, the negative points are:
1. Buds don't fit tightly enough in the case and if the case is disturbed, the buds might get loose and stop charging.
2. Another issue is connectivity, however, at this price I wouldn't expect more.
3. The surround sound is fake, and the extra power can actually hurt your ears. This was noted by me during a 1.5 hour call, which resulted in my ears hurting even with one bud (Mono mode)
4. Battery backup is pathetic. Each bud can go upto 1.5 hrs on calls (max), and music playback for both buds is 1 hr, after which the sound falls and rises, sounding weird and you HAVE TO CHARGE AGAIN!",2
1136,Honest Review,"So, it's a good product as per the cost.
1. Sound quality is better. (****)
2. When it comes to Bass, it does not have as much as I expected. (***1/2)
3. You can use buds continuously for 4 hours. Charging case provides 12 hours of power. Earbuds can be charged 3 times. (***)
4. Light weighted, can be fit in the ears perfectly. (****)
5. Having possible features. (****)
6. It fails at calling voice. Calling voice won't be clear. It produces a noise (can be hear by other person) while speaking over call. (**)",4
1137,OK PRODUCT.... NOT SURE ABOUT LONG LIFE THOUGH,"Good product atbthe price point. Keep the expectations low about this. It gets work done. However scored it low on below point
1. Right earbud stopped getting charged when put in case. Tried everything but not working at all. Fully drained it and tried charge again it
works.
Not sure about long life since the above issue happened within 10 days of purchase.

Advantage is that we can use one earbud at a time keeping other inside the case which allows one to use it.",3
1138,Awesome product from MI again.. Good product compared to the price range and Better mic too..,"The product is well built and sound quality is also good for music lovers. Bass is loud, highs and lows are also well refined.

Mic\call quality is awesome at this price range. Main point is before attending the call, you need to adjust earbud to outside little bit.. because MIC position went inside to the ear, if you wear it like songs hearing position. (This is reason many of the reviews are bad related to call quality)
(You should concentrate on MIC position before calling for better call quality)

Perfect fit in ears and creates vacuum in ears
Connecting time with the paired device (2-3 sec).
Bit difficult in taking the buds out of the case because of design flaw.

If you keep the buds in your pocket and walk you will hear a sound coming out of the case as the buds are little bit loose inside the case.

Overall, the product is more than average and is good for listening music and indoor calling's...",5
1139,NOT WORTH FOR Rs.1100,"Iam a normal user,

The most important thing is,
Redmi 2c is not good for outer door.

ZERO noise cancellation.

Sound is not good( while in the call-both indoor and outdoor)
Mic is fine(only indoor)
Bass is not very bad.( some thing is there)

Bad BLuetooth range ( disturbance at 20 ft range itself)even though it is BT 5.0.

Power back up: only 2 times (10 -100%) buds can be charged with the box.

Just 2.5 hrs battery back on single charge of buds.

Not comfortable, it is falling down if bent down.
I have tried changing buds , but no use.
Slipping from the ear if you Walk fast.

It won’t last more than 6months, just a guess , since manufacturer itself not confident in their product quality( warranty for 6 months only)

Not worth for Rs.1100",2
1140,Excellent earbuds for the price,"Bought this for my sister after I realised that the new phone I advised her to get didn't have a headphone jack. I already had a pair of Redmi Earbuds that I had had shipped from China (before it was launched in India) and had been happy with the music quality, Bluetooth range, battery capacity (both for the buds and the case), passive noise cancellation, as well as the price. The Redmi Earbuds S are also similarly impressive, although the issue of lag that exists with the basic version still does exist on these buds as well, so they may not be the best thing for gaming, but they serve almost all other purposes very well. Absolutely recommend.",5
1141,Redmi Earbuds 2C,"Have always had a penchant for wired earphones, have owned top-shelf wired earphones.
Never liked the Cupertino-brand lookalikes sold online, so didn't bother with TWS, until I set my eyes on the Redmi Earbuds 2C.
Loved the design, at least they're having their own identity and not being pretentious!
Also, they don't bulge out of your ears and make you look silly.
Audio wise, they're great with the connection, too.
I've tested them in various scenarios, intensive work outs, Zoom Meetings, Netflix and console gaming and music streaming. Didn't disappoint one bit.
One factor about these I liked, that they are very comfortable to wear. Never once fell out, or had me at fear of them falling off.
The case, in itself looks premium, with it's all matte finish, but will be prone to scratches.
With the oncoming festive season, these are great for gifting.
My mother can't get enough of these. She uses them to watch recipes on YouTube, while in the kitchen! I say, paisa vasool! 💕
She says, why don't these come in Pink. 🙉 Are you listening, Mi? 🙈",5
1142,Good for music but not for talking.,"Overall it justifies its price but the main problem lier with its noise cancellation. Forget about the cancellation, it picks up the distant noise so that the other person hears them more than your voice. Very bad at this. Apart from this, like other earpods it doesn't have much music control from its button. You can only pause and play, to change the track you have to operate your phone which is a big time inconvenience while working out. Had I known this earlier I would have returned it.
Final verdict: Not recommending.",3
1143,No value for money,"Charging case quality poor. It seems it won't last for an year even.
Sound quality is average.
Bluetooth connectivity is not good as connection break several times.
For call microphone quality is not good and if u don't speak louder then voice is not clearly audible to caller.
Battery backup is good.",1
1144,Nice earbuds at this price/stop working after falling,"At this price point Rs 1299 product is best
Sound is ok ok but according to price value for money

Now after 2 days, one earbud mistakenly fall 2 times by 3 feet height and stopped working
Rest your view",1
1145,In Budget - great tws earbuds 💞,"Redmi brought these new earbuds in market recently. Updated and amazing.

The earbuds have nice sound quality. The noise cancellation is also works well .

The bass is little less but if you are a normal user then you'll not notice it.
The voice quality is good and sound crisps.

Battery life is also good. I use 4hour listening to music. I had to charge the case once in two days. Pretty good experience till now 💞.

If you have tight budget and want decent amount of premium looks and sounds ,do try this earbuds.",5
1146,Okay Product,"This product is ok for listening purpose. They reduce the unwanted times where we always have to carry the wired headphones. But this is not suitable for voice calling and google voice assistant. Because they are not good in noise-cancelling while on call.

Many of my friends told me that whenever I speak it is something like I am speaking from a long distance and not the usual way. So if you are looking for calling purpose, it is good.",3
1147,Not recommended,"Headset pair easily when you took then out of the charging case.
Battery backup is good I guss as I haven't used any tws headsets.
Not comfortable to wear.
Audio distortion present.
At sometimes audio in each headphone is out of sync.
Hinges in the charging case are shaking little bot.
Build quality needs to be improved.",2
1148,Great earbuds,"I have used all sorts of earbuds except the premium ones. But this pair of earbuds are better than anything else in the same price point. MI has a global reputation which it keeps that way with products like these. I have been using these for more than an year. bought as a gift to my wife, now I have bought another for myself. So you know when husbands do that gesture.",5
1149,Liked them,"Well these earbuds are truly value for money.
Talking about pros and cons,
Pros:
. Light weight
. Small in size
. Good battery backup
. Hasselfree connectivity(After first time
connection every time you take them out
of the case they connect automatically)
. After using you don't need to switch them
off just keep them in the case
. Attempted calls many times didn't faced
any issues
. Fits well, comes with eartips of sizes S,M,L

Cons:
. Quality of case aswell as earbuds is decent
not that great but not that bad too
. Sound quality is pretty good, bass is
average but for most of the songs there is
no problem.

Conclusion:
These are the best earbuds you can buy under 2000 (till now).
👍",4
1150,Many pros. One big con,"If you are buying this to listen to music then please don't do it. If you are a bass lover then spend a little more and look elsewhere. It has no punch. It's OK to listen to audiobooks or for morning walks. Also checked for phone calls. The other person could hear me. Works ok for Zoom and Skype also. Battery seems good. I used for 2 hours. But after two or two and half hours the sound starts fading in and out and you have to charge it. Workmanship is good. Design is also good and lightweight. Don't use while riding a bike. If it flies out of your ears you will never find it again. It's so small. My verdict; for music it's a BIG no. For everything else, sure go for it.",3
1151,Amazing as Always.,"Edit1: The right side earbud stopped working after 5 days. Not expected from Redmi. Most of us are facing the same issue so it's your luck if your piece works flawless.🤣I have ordered replacement for the same lets see how it goes. Changing rating from 5 to 3. I'm giving it three just bcz one earbud stopped working else it's a 5 star rating product.
I ordered these on the launch date itself. It took 3 days to get it delivered without prime membership. Thank u Redmi for such awesome earbuds. Sound quality is perfect considering the price bracket.
Bass : 9/10
Treble : 9/10
Comfort : 10/10
Very light in weight so you can wear these for continuous 3-4 hrs without any pain in your ears.
Call Quality : 10/10
Build : 10/10
Battery : I got 90% charged so can't say much about it. After listening for 20 mins, it dropped by 10%. I will edit this point after 2-3 days of usage.
No issues with bluetooth connection.",5
1152,Very Good Product,"This my own opinion(true). The sound quality is good, noise cancellation is best. Also bluetooth connectivity is awesome. It connects quickly to your device. A box comes in which there is an user manual, some earbuds and finally the best TWS redmi earbuds S. They are small in size and in light weight. There is also gaming mode. The battery of earbuds with charging case is 12 hours.
Hope it is useful for you!!!!",5
1153,Waste product,Cheap product.. battery backup is very low around 1.5 hrs,1
1154,This earbud always falls off the ear,"This product told us that the earbud will not be falling from our ear which was false, this product always fell from my ear and I had a constant tension while wearing it if this earbud would fall. The quality of this earbud is very bad and the case can easily be broken. The earbud's multi-button functions are also very bad as there is no volume up or down or forward. Instead, there is play pause, google assistant, and latency gaming mode. The google assistant is useless and the quality of the mic is also very useless. The earbud responds from the phone for google assistant. And gaming mode is also very bad. Overall I want to say that I feel very bad and am regretting buying this product.",1
1155,4/5 they're pretty good,"They're really good actually,
Better than i expected, tbh
Sound quality is good enough, not as good as an overhead headphone though,
But i can only use it for an hour or so, then it starts to get uncomfortable (that might be different experience for you)
I wish they were a bit smaller or different shape, because when i lay down my head on a side, the button gets pressed, and music stops, you just got to tilt you head just the right amount to keep the button from getting pressed,
Wireless experience is as good as it can be,

Good purchase 👍",4
1156,Amazing for this price range.,"This one is good for this price range. Sound quality is nice. But I don't feel much confident in the build quality. And as for noise cancellation, it seems to be fine for Normal phone calls. But for whatsapp call and others like Google meet, the sound is not even clear. I don't know if this is a software problem. However speaking about battery. I never came across a situation where I had to plug it in since normal anyone will not continuously use it instead they keep it back in the case. Hence it recharges again. And the idea where any one of the earpiece can be used make it an amazing product. Certainly we don't need to compare this with flagship products like Jabra and other.",5
1157,Buy at your own risk. It might or might not work.,"Worked well for 2 days. Right bud stopped working after that. No sound. No light. Tried resetting. Tried re pairing. Still doesn't work. Asked for a replacement.

Upadte: Got the item replaced. As of now it's working fine. As long as it works fine, its value for money. Use the trouble shooting ( Hard Reset) if the issue with one earbud arises.

Now that too stopped working. This is really a ln absolute waste of money. Pathetic product.

Now it's working again. It's been a rollercoaster ride with this product. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it stops working while it is in use, you have to put it back in the case and take it out again for making it work.",3
1158,Value for money but issues with mic,"I am facing some problem with the mic. When I use it for office calls. The frequent comment is we can't hear you well because your voice is breaking.

I have tried with numerous high speed wifi with download/upload speed of 240mbps/40mbps (Ookhla tested) so it is definitely not internet connection problem.

But otherwise, quite goood for work out and mahn that's excellent battery life. So I found it value for money",5
1159,Poor Connectivity and Build Quality,"Review after using for a month: Overall average product, quality in line with the low price tag. Sound and microphone is fine but poor connectivity ruins the experience. The build is not good and does not seem durable.

Pros:

1. Average sound quality, its quite good for the price range
2. Vey less lag, gaming experience is good even without gaming mode
3. Microphone quality is good, been using it for calls

Cons:

1. Poor build quality, the buds do not always fit into the case properly and have to remove it multiple times before charging starts
2. Poor connectivity, sometimes it blanks out for a few seconds randomly
3. Does not connect with windows systems always in one attempt",2
1160,Worst connectivity,IF YOU ARE READING THIS PLS DO NOT BUY THIS EARBUDS! yeah voice calling is bad and there r so many bad things about it but the worst part is it doesn't perform the most imp job and that is it just can't stay connected ! It disconnects automatically and thn again gets connected automatically ! And if u will read some more reviews you will realise that it is happening with every buyer !,1
1161,You can definitely buys,"Overall it's good
At this price point what esle do you want
Its been 4 months and now I am writing this review had no issues
You get 4hrs of battery easily with my buds and upto 11 n half hrs with case don't know about others.
Vocals are great, bass is good
A slight tweak in you equaliser you will get great output out of your buds on Spotify in my case
I have dropped it twice with and without case, a moderate fall, wasn't tampered hard fall, don't know about that
You can buy this easily no better buds are available at this price except realme q I guess
If you see a mesh on the lid in photo its my doing cause it used to have slight wobbling to it in case that's the only problem I have faced till now
And at last go for it and you won't regret until and unless you know how to use and maintain ; hope you didn't find it too long to read and helped to you to some extent 😅 and have a nice day✌️.",5
1162,Good buy,"Good packing and received before expected date of delivery. I have been using this for a week and so far I don't find any issues.

Likes:
1. Good quality sound don't expect like sony or bose.
2. Small in size and easy to maintain
3. We can take up calls from earbuds it self.
4. It works well if I keep my phone in hall and speak from bedroom as well.
5. Battery backup 4-6 hours I get in earbuds it self

Don't likes:
Earbuds magnetic power should have been high so that it will stick strong.

Apart from this i don't see much issues.",5
1163,"Below average,not worth it!","Not comfortable at all,ears pain after using it for 2 hrs,also not good backup,nd while u put it back in the case,to start charging it's not auto adjusted in its position,u have to shake it a litl to start charging, don't know whether a defective product,or its developed in this worse quality by redmi, don't go 4 it, honestly spend sm more nd ul get better air pods around 3000₹,thank you!",2
1164,"Good quality sound, good build, great range","I am NOT an audiophile. Just got these for phone convos and online classes for my children

The sound is clear, the other side can hear us clearly so Mic is good. And the range is surprisingly very good, though not of much use when you have to sit in front of Laptop anyway

I don't know issues the bad reviewers faced...but for this value pricing I am extremely satisfied with the purchase",5
1165,Sleek and Powerful,"Extremely lightweight, and small.
I am impressed with the easy and quick BT connectivity and the brilliant bass calibration. (bass heads will know, what im talking about)

Overall a sleek buy for 1.2K, go for it.

Only con is that this is a Chinese product. Rest its got everything you are looking for like a decent fit and good mic.",5
1166,Best budget true wireless good quality earphones but not the best in the market,"Good quality sound at budget wireless price.
Haven't experienced noice cancellation but it exists.
Water resistant quality is good. Once fell in water but working just fine.
Biggest issue is connectivity and battery draining issue.
Sometimes only one side is connected and if u try to connect other the only other one connect. It makes experience annoying but also some times it goes out of charge and just doesn't charge or start until I keep it charging for few days and randomly it starts working again.
Final words : true wireless at best budget but comes with some catches.
Good audio experience but may also give some issues with charging and connectivity.",3
1167,HORRIBLE PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY AT ANY COST.,"DO NOT BUY. HORRIBLE PRODUCT. Takes forever to charge and doesnt last. Heats up in 20 mins. Since i coukd not return it, i had to throw it in the dustbin only where it actually belong. Why does Mi bring out such cheap and horrible product and cheat customers ?",1
1168,Amazing product must go for it 👍,"I brought this product nearly 20 days ago , it is working fine with great sound quality , today it fell in a bucket full of water and left earbuds got damaged and working with low sound after keeping that earbud in rice bag and I checked it it didnt worked fine after using it for 30 more minutes suddenly it worked well now both earbuds runs same intensity of sound it is really amazing 👍 thought it is not a waterproof it worked",5
1169,All 5 🌟 reviews are looks good to read but please don't fall for positive reviews,"All are good except the Bluetooth connectivity it's very bad.
Don't go for it.
Maybe reviews look good to read but in experience it's not good.
Even replace product has same problem 😡
Finally I got one thing in my mind if you need any gadgets please go for branded and higher value goods not go for cheap products like this",1
1170,Quality Earbuds for this attractice price,"Liked the sound quality. You can't expect BIG BASS with such earbuds however. No issues in connectivity. Very convenient and clean sound.

Sound Quality- You will not hear that loud sound but the clearity is just next level smooth sound
Noise cancellation - It is just perfect .. once you will place it probably and sound is on you will not hear surrounding sound
Bass quality - It is also good according to me as I am not so fond of bass for me sound quality matters the most .. but for bass lover this is perfect",5
1173,Doesn’t serve the purpose,"It looks good! And was able to hear well but the problem is the mic . People felt as if I was talking from the other end of the room and zero noise cancellation!!! I was not heard but things in background was picked up very well ☹️
Was so looking forward but have to return it now!",1
1174,Value for Money,"These buds are light and sit securely in my ears. They can also suitably block ambient noise without posing any inconvenience even when worn for hours at a stretch. Redmi Buds do not look or feel cheap and the compact charging case they come in is also of fairly good quality.

Overall audio quality is decent for the price

Using multifunctional buttons, you can control music playback & manage incoming calls

*The charging port is the regular micro USB. If your phone has a Type-C port, you will need to carry a separate charging cable for the case.

The charging case and buds together carry 12 hours of backup: the case can charge these buds thrice. around 3.5 hours of playback time on a single charge, which is quite decent. The case takes 1.5 hours to fully charge these buds.",5

I was worried before it get delivered as other reviewers says that it's box is little loose,
Trust me the charging case is not loose at all. It is perfect.

I am satisfied with battey back-up of the product and the way both buds can be used by two different people by different phones.

Talking about sound, trust me this product has better sound (including noise cancellation while on call, bass) than boat rockerz neckband 225 as I already use this.",5

1178,It has stopped getting charged | Very cumbersome to sync it,"This device is just a month old and it has stopped getting charged.

I bought it for my mother and it's so very difficult to sync it. Maybe I should have just got her iPhone and Airpods. They are so easy to work with. This one is just too difficult to sync every time.

Also for me, the earbuds just sleep out of my ear all the time.

I don't recommend to buy these. Rather use a wired one if you don't want to spend.",1
1179,See review before purchase. Not for music lover,"I purchased the item 27th may. I get the product on last Monday and I placed the return request yesterday and returned today.
Because I am not pro gamer. Play game suddenly. I purchased the product only for music. But I am very disappointed.
1. Build quality is good.
2. Music quality is below average. Low bass and treble is average.
3. Not for music lover.
4. Not played games so can’t comment.
5. Not comfortable. I heard almost 3 hours and it’s painful to my ears. If your ears size is big then ok otherwise painful.

Only gud thing about this product is just sound. As everyone mention, while listening to music it stops automatically for a couple of seconds & gets connected again. This problem persist wid everyone. Baaki galti se phone pe baat mat karlena else other person on call gets irate specifically ur gf/bf. Plz. DON'T BUY IT FOR CALLING PURPOSE!",1
1183,Good buds in such a price range,"Overall a good product from MI at 1299/- price range.

Pros:
1. Easy to connect to any bluetooth device for audio
2. Fits easily in ears without causing any kind of pain for hours
3. Bass is okaish
4. Easy to carry charger and charge anywhere
5. Compact size

Cons:
1. Build quality is cheap. Plastic look
2. Bass could have been better
3. Charger quality looks cheap and magnetic power is also not so good. Ear pieces fall off easily and box can easily break
4. Could have been a Type C charging port rather than micro usb as most of the phones nowadays have type c port

If you are tight on budget and need a wireless buds for comfort music, calls, meetings and watching movies.
Go for it. You wont get good quality from a premium brand like MI in this range

Thank you Amazon for a wonderful fast delivery. Hats off",3
1184,"after 1 year of use, do check the edit part","Sound quality 9/10
Mic 6/10 (need to speak louder)
Noise cancellation 9/10
Bass 7/10 (nice descent bass)
Comfortable to ear 7/10
Latency there is still an audio lag in PUBG while playing with moto g5 plus in gaming/latency mode but for movies and stuff they work good.

EDIT: they are very bad after two weeks of use they are creating an irritating problem. Normally you put these buds in case and they start charging but after two weeks they have become loose or something. You have keep adjusting them after putting in box until charging indicator turns on. Although there is magnet that pulls them in the box automatically without doing much effort but it also doesn't work much. You have to set them manually.

Edit 2: they keep on synchronising while listening to anything which makes them very irritating as audio starts cutting in every other second of time period and then you have to shut them down completely and restart again to make them work fine.

Edit 3: they are worst earlier after buying they would work like 3-4 on single charge and now they need charging in every hour.

They are horrible and my ratings has also changed from 5 to 1",1

1187,A Genuine Review On Redmi Earbuds S.,"I found redmi earbuds s a bit distorted in higher volumes. I am writing this review after purchasing the same, using it for two days and then returning the product back. It can be used for watching videos on YouTube or talk shows if you are into that kind of stuff. But this is not made for music at all. You will like the mid bass genre of songs but vocals is terrible on this one.
I purchased it as a switch from my wired earphones but unfortunately i am disappointed and been using the wired ones lately.Thanks.",2
1188,"Good at this price tag, but realme buds Q will be better if u can wait.","Review-
Call quality- avarage, mic issue.
Connectivity- Best at this tag, thanks to Bluetooth 5.0
Sound quality- Avarage, small driver 7.2mm, vocal are not that good, bass is decent
Battery life- 2.5 hrs with single charge, USB 3.0 (Need C type) and slow charging
Bulid quality- Poor case quality, cheap plastic used, case lid is very poor quality.
Verdict- If u r looking for tws and having tight budget with some known brand under 2K then go for it, otherwise OnePlus bullet Z is best in wireless catagory. If you can wait for another 1 month then i will suggest wait for realme buds Q, far better option than Redmi eardbud S under same price tag.",4

1193,Don't ever buy this pair of TWS!!!,"I'm gonna write an honest review about these pairs of earbuds.
frankly speaking, they're available at a cheap price of 1799/- that's cool, but the problem is that at this price TWS earbuds would always be compromised in quality and Redmi Airdots S makes a great example of that.
I bought these TWS earbuds two times in two weeks. I bought for the first time and I was really disappointed with the quality and sound issues, I thought this was a unit problem and I bought another piece of the same earbuds. Honestly speaking there were no issues with the battery but after continuous 2 hours of usage the sound starts breaking and as it claims 4 hours usage in one go isn't possible as you have to place the earbuds back in the case after 2-hour continuous use to bring it back to normal. Also, there was another incident when the earbuds started making a sound on its own even after being disconnected from the phone.
The low latency mode in these earbuds has no effect at all while gaming.
The case is made of plastic and looks pretty premium at this price bracket, cannot complain about the materials and comfort at this price though.

With more than 40 hours of usage, I came to the conclusion that I should return these earbuds and the chances of them getting deteriorated were pretty high and thus they won't last long. These earbuds have too many problems to be dealt with.

Also, I would suggest everyone not to buy this product, whenever you're getting TWS earbuds at this low prices some of the features would always be compromised. Either you have to invest more to buy a good product or go with the Wireless earphones of the same price ranges.",2

I would recommend one should purchase this product if you want to listen uninterrupted music & video and use voice assistant.

My spouse has got irritated when I use this product over the call. She can hear the car sound or dog barking from 1 km distant.
Just after 5 month one of the side of earbud has stop connected then I had to visit service center.
They couldn't resolve the issue but replace the product.",2

You can also use google assistant just by saying,""ok google"" instead of pressing the button twice which I suppose,can be done on any normal earphone and secondly it doesn't allow you to control the volume.Except this,everything is fine with it and you should go for these if you are really looking of an under budget deal.",3

Good quality sound and perfect noise filtering. The bass is perfect for music and movie lovers.

1. No noise cancellation at all. In fact people on the other end were able to hear the TV sounds being played in my other room more clearly than my own voice. The mic wasn't up-to the mark at all. I don't understand on what basis Redmi says that it has noise cancellation.

2. Bluetooth issues. The earbuds were so much into connecting themselves with my phone that even after I placed them back in the case & also, turned them off, still when I receive any calls, they would automatically connect with my phone and I have to disable my Bluetooth connection then while on the call. BUT when I actually wanted to use them and tried connecting them it won't work.

Clearly, a defective Product launched by Xiaomi. Used not once but twice, and the same response.",2
1203,at this price it deserve 5 star,"everything is good in this mini bar. sound clarity - 5 star, bass quality- 5 start, noise cancelleation - 4 star.

Also, when i put this for more than 3 hours in ear it starts paining the ear. so would recommend to take out when not needed.

rest everything is as displayed and mentioned in catalouge",5
1204,Good product at cheap rate,I really like the fact that once u remove these out of the case they automatically come on and if u have previously paired it with ur phone they will automatically pair again without having to do anything. They fit nicely in the ears and won't fall off. Sound clarity is nice and if u r looking for budget earbuds go for it. They won't compare to apple but still come cheap and serve the purpose. Overall a good product.,4

These sleek and stylish Earbuds fit comfortably in ears. The thing which I like the most about these Earbuds is its case it is small & that too so light weighted which can easily be carried in pockets & bags.

1209,@amazon better avoid selling Redmi earbud 2C,"Genuine review redmi earbud 2C

Bought this earned for my kid's youtube channel educational interests. Bought at 1099 with amazon voucher.

Everytime got a defective product only.

1st time - left side ear bud stopped working after 3 days

2nd time - right side bud stopped working after 1st use.

While keeping inside case, it is not charging. Secondly it is not switching on. So obviously not connecting too. Tried reset procedure as instructed by redmi, holding for 15~20 sec multi option button, but no use.

Better avoid buying Redmi earbudb 2c . A product everyone failing symbolizes no quality check.

Every time a product is defective shows the quality of Redmi, china. Off course it's made in China Aug 2020 batch.

@amazon better avoid selling Redmi earbud 2C",1
1210,Good earphones in budget,"After using these earphones extensively for a while, I would say that the quality at which these earphones are being sold is good. It is easy to pair with Bluetooth, the charge lasts for a long time and the outer casing is sleek. I charge the earphone casing for 20 mins and it lasts for a long time.

The noise cancellation effect is not that great but what can one ask at such price point. Do buy it because it has the best sound in this price range. It might take a while for you to get adjusted to wireless earphones. Be cautious when you are moving out as these could fall with improper care.",5
1211,GAME IS CHANGED.. GO FOR IT GUYS COZ' SIMILAR RESULTS WOULD COST YOU >3000 ANYWHERE ELSE,"Punchy Bass, Trebles are great. Instruments sound distinctive. I Previously used to tuned my equaliser for getting all these results in balance and VOILA, This little thing is already giving all that without tweaking any equaliser. GREAT WORK XIAOMI, I'm Happy with my money spent good.

4 Stars for sound quality because the moment i switched from my mi handsfree to this beauty the first thing I observed that mids are a bit muddier , which general listeners won't observe over long use. I think i need to rouse the drivers before writing in depth comparison with wired handsfree.

EDIT: MIDS ARE IMPROVED TO AN EXTENT AFTER DRIVER ROUSING (CONTINUOUS PLAYING).
All the people crying out for bad calling experience, it'll need an explanation as I've used this on two devices, i.e. Redmi note 3 with BSNL and Poco X2 with Jio, And the person on other side was complaining about a jitter in voice only when i called him with RN3. With Poco X2, Calls were magnificent, which means that poor quality might be an issue with your device and operator's signal quality+strength.

Connectivity wise its alright, pairs in a couple of seconds with phone and themselves, nothing to review about.

FINAL VERDICT
You won't get this quality, experience and feature anywhere in whopping ₹1800/-. I Feel bad for all those who reviewed it as a bad product. Believe me everybody wants to compare its quality with wired headsets which is technically wrong and and and stop comparing this with Apple's airpods or Samsung's earbuds.

 The case is preety non sturdy with its loose magnetic grip and how a white mark appeared on it just after a mere two to three days. The sound quality of the earbuds is good and the battery is fine I guess but it only give 6-7 hours of backup with the case and I also happened to receive some disturbances of sound breaking when I was listening some track on it when I was within 5 meteres of my phone. The buttons on the earbuds are really very bad I feel like crying whenever I accidentally press the button for too when I'm relaxingly listening on it and the button also is really uncomfortable wherever I press it I feel like I'm forcing the earbuds to stay in my ear which feels very uncomfortable.",3

1217,Super...!,"Redmi earbuds.
To be honest didn't expected them to be that good.
These buds are light weight. They fit perfectly in the ear.
Bluetooth connectivity is quick and the range is also too good.
Now talking about the sound quality,
The treble is very good and the bass quality is quite good.
Overall the mixture of treble and bass is well balanced.
They are ear friendly means they do not cause pain to your ears.
And the best thing about these earbuds is their pricing.

It works really well on all those contexts. I have never drained the battery fully yet! Though I use it only 4-5 hours max a a stretch (by habit).

One caveat, it does tend to shift around if your are exercising. I lift weights and during intense workouts, when I wince, I end up loosening the pods from my ear!",5

So I donot recommend these...
Buy these if they decrease its price to a maximum of Rs 400. Above this price these are not acceptable...",1
1224,Less than average product !,"I would sum up this product in few points:

1. The bass is poor and it is acceptable because this is a wireless earbud.

2. It picks up external noise way too heavily and you won't be able to use it when your TV is on or some noisy fan is on. The person hearing you on the other side will hear a lot of noise.

3. There is no active noise cancellation and passive cancellation is useless. So you would find a wired headset performing far better than this.

4. The connectivity is average and the pairing time is decent.",2
1225,Best TWS when comes to price to performance!,"Writing review after using it for 4 days
Considering the important criterias.
1)Sound quality:- 4/5 sound is clear, high, mids, lows are clear, but as you move away from the connected devices the sound get cut.
2) Battery backup:- 4/5 it says 4hrs but it lasts for 3.30hrs as by review done by youtubers, I've personally not tested it. And 43mAH each ear bud and 300mAH case. Approximately upto 12hrs with case.
3) Connectivity:- 3/5 bluetooth 5.0, it takes some sec to connect, but not too late, when i connected to my mobile redmi note 5, the range was long and clear but when i connected it to laptop, the sound started to break, after moving a very small distance, they say connectivity upto 10m.
4) Comfort:- 4/5 when you put it into ears you won't feel it, since it is just 41gm very light weight, adjust with your buds medium bud comes with fixed and you get small and large,else it will fall off, after sometimes you might feel uncomfortable for those for are trying in ear for the 1st time.
5)Bass:- 5/5 definitely i love the beats of this earbuds it uses 7.2mm driver, all the beats are very punchy and if you love beats this is definitely for your l.
6)Controls:- 3/5, since there is no option to skip songs and change volume it might be irritating to open your mobile and change it everytime. 1tap for pause/play, 2 taps to activate siri/google assistant and 3taps to activate low latency mode and other reset control given in manual. The thing i like is it comes with physical buttons, which won't get unnecessary touchs but when you press button the earbud may go further into your ears which you find annoying.
7) Build quality:- 3/5, looks premium but quality is not that good, it is made of plastic and earbuds are hard but box is bit delicate nice thing is it's small and compact.
8) Charging speed:-4/5 It comes with micro usb and it's bad, in 2020 you must get type c, but when compared to price it's ok. ""Note"":- You won't get any charger or cable, you must have one at your home. It takes 1.5hrs to charge buds and 2hrs to charge both completely, i didn't test it personally but according to redmi amd youtubers.
9)Water resistant:- 3/5 since it is ipx4 it is only splash and sweat resistant, pls don't put into water, many earbuds of same price range come with ipx5,6 , so it's bit annoying.
10)Low latency game mode:- 3/5, i played pubg by activating this mode by pressing the button 3 times, it says it has 122ms, but i could make some milli seconds delay, but it's ok when compared to some earbuds which doesn't have this feature.
11)Noise cancellation:- 5/5, it says it has dsp environmental noise cancellation and it's completely based on software, nothing hardware device to do that work, since it's in ear it performs this effect better.
12) Calling:- 3/5, this is not a big deal for me since i use this very less, it comes with dual mike and i spoke with 2 persons with both earbuds and with either of one, they said there eas no disturbance, but 3star because youtubers and some review said it's not that good, so this is not my personal opinion.
13) Finally when it comes to price to perform 5/5, very less price with great specifications
I hope this review is more than enough to decide whether to purchase or not. But I'm in love with it!!",4
1226,Best budget bluetooth earphones,First about design it's kind of too small but very stylish and not to mention about the sleak design. There is no problem with pairing also it as soon as connect the second I removed it from the box. Battery is also impressive the range is of bluetooth is preety surprising. I played pubg with it and it's true about low latency mode I had good experience playing with it. The only problem is when I activate voice assistant there is some problem with the voice of Google that's why I took one star except that it's good it's the best value you can get for this price,4
1227,"Good, but....","They're honestly great for 1900. They fit in snugly, connect with phones pretty quickly and sync which each other really fast too. The treble and the middle is great, but bass isn't that good. You can download additional bass booster apps which certainly increase the quality, but in terms of raw bass quality, it's not that great. Another con is that they're quite uncomfortable if your ears are unusual in shape, because of the capsule design. The noice cancellation is excellent. Overall i'd say it's worth it, but don't buy it if you think you have unusual ears. Hope you find this helpful!",4
1228,Okay for low budget..!! You can go for it.,"Review after one day usage

Bought this on first day when launched, got delivered in 7 days..! Okay considering recent scenario of covid, actually I’m impressed.

Pros:
1. Sound quality is good, however on low volume you will not get a very good experience. Overall it’s satisfactory considering price. Not more core music lovers.
2. Looks good
3. Very lightweight
4. In ear built design hence its good in looks when you wear them
5. Buttons are soft touch, easy to use not that problematic
6. Call quality: Ok this is not that bad, But also not that good, other person will hear some echo sometime. Also outer voice will come more to the recipient than your own voice. If u are sitting in a quiet place its good. U can take this for normal calling or calling while driving but don’t take this if u are looking primarily for a calling device. I have used other TWS but calling is not good in any of them, however redmi earbuds is better as compared to them.
7. Mat finish, perfect black colour which i can match with my black iphone 8 plus and black i watch 👌🏻
8. No touch sensors hence no chance of disconnecting calls mistakenly
9. Well recognised brand, warranty, u can trust the company

Cons:
1. Slippery case, u can’t pull earbuds out of the box very easily. Need to use both hands to open case.
2. It completely seals the ears, u can’t even notice how loud u started talking over call.
3. Battery is ok, not great
4. No sound track change feature
5. You can’t increase or decrease volume

Overall its good if u are looking for earbuds with not a apple like design (because it looks like cheap brands copied product, which I don’t like) and your budget is 1799 max.
However if u can afford more than this price range like 3000-4000 you should search for other better option.

PS: I don’t play much games hence not checked latency mode.",4
1229,Noise Cancellation issue,"I generally use these for calling purpose and it was a big time failure. Person on receiving end would always complain about voice echoes, too much disturbance, buzz, etc. Tried for 6-7 days and finally returned.

1231,Best tws buds under 2k. Pretty bad for gaming.,"Writing this review after three months of full usage. Used with both Windows laptop and Android device.
1) The battery life is just exceptional. If you start using them at 100% you will still have 50-60% after 2-2.5 hours which is great for such a budget pair of earphones.
2) The latency is very bad. While playing PUBG after firing 10 bullets after 5-10 second the sound of bullets come.
3) The connectivity is just seamless with both Windows device and Android.
4) The charging is quite fast for the buds when kept inside the case. And for the case i used a 12W Rapid charger so for me the charging speed for case was also quite fast.
5) Build quality is okish, I'd give 3 starts in that area. The buds look like they are very delicate. And the case is completely made of cheap plastics so while closing the case you can feel that build quality isn't great.
6) Overall i think that if you are on a very tight budget (like me) then only you should get these if not then go for some other tws buds. Also if you only want tws buds the only buy it or there are other options of neckband like OnePlus bullet Z or Oppo enco M31.

These are best tws buds under ₹2,000 because Redmi is a trusted brand.",4

1235,Earpod Stopped working,"I bought this earphones as a diwali gift.

The earphones were good, but then 2 hrs later they stopped working.

Fortunate to have Amazon Replacement, I got them replaced.

This time they worked for about 9 days.

But then they have again stopped working.

Fully Charged, extremely light use, and careful handling yet, it took less than 10 days to malfunction and die.

Really bad build quality. Cannot recommend them to anyone.

The sound quality wasn't impressive either, there are other earphones in same price category with better experience.

Bass was decent to be honest, and Noise cancellation is just due to the eartips and not because of software.

They are not using software based noise cancellation, that is its just passive noise cancellation",1

- decent bass
- good call quality
- comfortable and fits in ear without any irritation.

CONS.
- bulid quality ( cant complaint because of the price ) . If we accidentally step on this earbuds it wil broken in to pieces without any doubt.
- misses type C charging
- feel less unclear with the music trebles( use it for one day then you will be adjusted ).
Verdict - go for this without any doubt",5
1237,"Amazing product with manual press buttons, good sound quality","After going through alot of products in the market i came across this one, first of all its quite handy and small in size, the quality of the buds is amazing one of the best thing about this product that it comes with hard press button on both the sides because the sensitive touch always created issues while using one of them , so I'm really not a fan of buds with touch buttons, also has a very good sound quality and totally worth at its price.",5
1238,"Best Review, Trust me.","Hey all! I did a lot of research before buying this earbuds. Countless searching online, added with comparing products, reviews, price. So trust me, when you go through my detailed review. I was skeptical about shifting to a TWS (truly wireless stereo) earphone from the average wireless segment. Keeping the cost into the factor, I didn't have a lot on my plate. I could spare around 2000 and comparatively Redmi airbuds S was the only product available in that range (with a familiar company name).

1) Connectivity, Durability, Charging -
The device connects pretty easily, with no issues as such. I moved over to the next room, despite the hindrance in between the earbuds and the phone, there was no significant problems as such.
The device seems sturdy enough, a lot of people complained about the quality of the charging case, and yes they are definitely of pretty cheap quality, but they do feel good if you do decide to get a hands on (cause of the matte finish).
The charging wasn't an issue (despite no USB included in the box), the device charges automatically when you place it in the charging case. The case itself needs a 2 hour charging stand time and as an user you have no way of making out when the box is out of charge. The device stayed awake for 3-4 hours on a single, so that's that.

2) Sound, Comfort, Value for money -
The device houses a SBC codec, which is the cheapest one in the market. It is an universal standard (all Earbuds have to have it) so imagine how average it actually is. I believe in ""burning-in"" my Earphones, which basically means...using your device for long hours to get an optimised sound quality. I used the device for two days at long stretches only to be left utterly disappointed with the quality, which eventually led me to return the product back to Amazon. The lows, highs, trebles, base, you can't differentiate between them. The sound was muddy and muffled and led to a lot of noise rather than music. That's a big thumbs down on that.
They are pretty comfortable, I did go for a run and cycle ride and they sat in my earlobes perfectly. I didn't feel any pain whatsoever and the fit was snuggly as well. Comfort won't be an issue.
The price range which it offers, no other popularized brands decided to offer such a product in that range (but now realme stepped in), TWS earbuds are very costly and not meant for the average user. So on the part where value for money is involved, I suppose they are definitely a good bargain if you planning to upgrade to a TWS.

Overall Verdict : The device is entry level TWS in the Indian market with a price which no one else dares to offer, Redmi and Realme did. Now if you are planning to upgrade from the wireless BT or wired earphones, they are a good pair of earbuds taking the price into consideration, but end of the day, we all buy earphones to listen to something...so in my opinion, this product is not worthy enough for that. They sound is incorrigible and unethical from the brand (I was using their sports by wireless and really loved that product).
So now all depends on you as an user, if you are really desperate to buy a TWS, then go for these (or the Realme Buds). But if sound quality is your priority, then wait, or buy something else.

Thank you for reading carefully, now I it's your choice.",3
1239,Just providing Bluetooth and sound output doesn't make a good earphone/earbuds,"Writing this review after using for 3 months
I regret buying anything from MI just because they are cheaper. The Bluetooth signal strength is worst. Won't even detect Bluetooth signal from my phone in my pocket l. There is so much lag between sound output and music. Sometimes sound signal is electronically stretched as if I am listening a ghost sound. The battery life is good. Mic doesn't work properly on call. Sometimes the other side won't work or connect. Don't buy this product. Go for a litlle bit expensive ones, they provide better quality only in few extra bucks",1

1243,DO NOT BUY,"Really good headphones, Fits in the ears perfectly, looks good, stealth black , That is not much branding anywhere which i like. I also like the sound quality but that is up to you.
One thing I would like to say is that Amazon delivery wasn't good. Even thought i am a PRIME customer my delivery had some problems,the product was stuck in transport. I had to call amazon 3 to 4 times and finally got my 2 day shipping after one week.
TIP: If you order is late, call amazon and ask for a replacement, specially if you are a PRIME customer

UPDATE: It was working fine before but now on call the receiving side gets a lot of background noise, I even complained to service center but they didn't do anything.

VERY BAD service and product",2

1245,Decent value for money.,"After using them for 2 to 3 month here's my review about this product.

Sound:
Sound quality is good bass is better on a average volume you can not listen music on it with full volume as sounds feels crappy. Over all I am happy with its sound quality.

Build Quality:
Build quality is good case and the earbuds doesn't loose there matt finish till now

Battry:
Battry backup is awesome sometimes I forget to charge them for days. Takes 1.5 to 2 hrs to be fully charged It's mention that it gives total 12 hours of backup but on daily life as a average user it's more than enough.

Connectivity:
I would say connectivity is ok ok.. Takes 2-5 sec to connect as it's not able to connect multiple devices at once, sometimes I struggle connecting and switching them between my mobile and my pc. And yes I don't why but sometimes connection strength become very poor. Bit disappointed for this only.

Overall
I had purchased 2 pair of these one for me and for my friend she sometime complain about earbuds connects automatically with mobile while they are in case and even in her handbag.....thats new😅 but I did not faced such issue till now.

I bought them the day release in around rs1750 each (salo ne koi discount bhi ni dia 2 lene pr bhi🙁) which is ok for me 😜....",4
1246,Expected more ... but...,"The product is a budget product , but can't we expect more from Mi..
Pros .
The device is light weight . You plug it and forget ..
As a daily driver it works for a day long if you are not having music / so much calls..

Assistant works nicely. You can call someone while driving / walking, when you are too far from device easily.

You can use the device in two phones .. left with one phone and right with other .. ie. You can give one to your wife / or any other family members to office .. and keep one ear pice with you..

The Sound quality is ok. Bass part is loud enough.
Noice cancellation is ok. You can't hear someone is talking near you when both the earbuds are in. This is also an issue when you are walking out with it in ear you can't hear vehicle sound or someone speaking to you in road..

The pairing and connectivity having no issues till. It is ok with some seconds delay... paring both the sets having no issues..

Cons:
Eventhough sound quality is ok and having enough bass ... you can't have a musical enthusiasm on this device. The sound become mix up.. and crapy when it's loud.

Call quality I put in cons because sometimes the person in the other end having some issues .. not all times .. especially when the call begins. But the problem is not aall time event.

Gaming : I bought this product to use for gaming. But it's not worthy for that , During PUBG game play the sound feedback we are getting is ok when it's in low letancy mode. But the game become lag at certain situations. "" It's not that much prominent when I'm playing it with wiredearphones ..

Last but not least .. I'm having an issue that when I connect this device to my PC and some other device having stock android, when ever a sound occurred the volume menu is appearing .. is this a device issue or something like that. So I'm trying to replace this one .",3
1247,Issue with Volume pop up again and again,"The product is great no doubt but having a issues while plugin with one plus7 the volume up down popup starts coming again and again, every 10 seconds, which is really terrible and frustrating for me. Secondly the product is made of china and I am totally against with the chinese product now, I can pay more amount but definately gonna go with Made in India products.",2
1248,Marvelous Earbuds 😍😍,"It's a stylish Redmi earbuds.
Love it's sleek design and absolutely light weight.
What I really expect about this it is great battery back up.
Since I've purchased, I charged only one time, battery runs approx more than 15 hours.
I love to travel with it, and this one comes really handle excellent noice cancellation.
and the sound quality is also good.
And bass quality is excellent,it works like theatre.
It is even perfect for working session.
And last but not least, in 1300 price nobody gives this type of facilities.",5
1249,Faulty Piece. Really bad experience. Not working right side earbud.,"Faulty piece.
Right earbud is not working.
I have tried many times to reset and pairing but no
On no off and also not pairing.
Only charging light blink.
And no other any led light signal right earbud.
Multifunctional button also not working on right earbud.",1
1250,Don't expect Wao Factor ! It's a budget earphone and does the said things.,"I have used multiple True Wireless Earbuds in last 2 years.
At this price point it is good as it comes with genuine warranty so if anything goes wrong you can rush to Mi Service center and get it replaced/rectified.

Pro
1. Lovely charging case
2. Good battery life
3. Good sound quality (No Wao Factor)

Cons
1. Frequently turns to Mono mode from stereo
2. Eartips bundled inside are somewhat slippery
3. No noise cancellation (you'll have to rely only on eartips which however is not so good)
4. Sometimes Mic stops working and it's really irritating when you're gaming.

For 1.5k
It's a good product, arranged some good eartips and this will sound good enough.",3
1251,Defective Product. Not recommended,"This is a defective product. This is bought for my Son with an intention of using while he attends online classes. But came to know that not working. I called Amazon customer care and tried all the ways of troubleshooting. But no results.

[I bought the same item for myself also. That was also a problematic gadget. Right piece stopped working. But the troubleshooting techniques worked and I could able to solve the problem.]

I need to go for warranty from Redmi.

My suggestion to the buyer is please don't buy this.",1

Finally It's Good But Not Best
Thanks",4
1253,Waste of money and time,"This is what the worst product I have even purchased from mi. Everything was good for almost 10 days but after that right earbud was neither charging, nor was getting on. I was using the remaining one. After a while, left one started getting disconnected from the phone automatically. Tried to fix the problem and wasted my time in watching correction videos also. Totally waste of money.",1
1254,Low budget option but not satisfied overall,"Using it since a week
Pros:
Sound is ok
Build quality
Cheap in price
Connectivity

Cons:
Mic issue
Can't use for long term
Press button for change song or pick phone cause pressure in ears..better to change from mobile.

Overall better option for less than 2K budget but not the best in market",3
1255,Cheap and Good,"Received this product today. Its really light in weight. Looks really good. Charging case lid is very basic. Okayish quality, not bad. But it will last only if you take good care of it. NO charging cord is provided with this product. I paid rs 1799 for this product. Im satisfied with the sound quality. As per my observation, 1300rs-1500rs is the perfect price for this wonderful product. But Im happy with 1799 as its just launched.

Review update 9th June 2020
I had just charged the earbuds and its box both full (100%) at once. It's the 4th day today since the full charge, still these earbuds are operative with around 70% (earbuds) and case (0%). I have used these earbuds daily approx 2 hours for 4 days. I must say this, the battery backup is really great and Im very satisfied. Previously I was using boat rockerz 255r, so comparing it with the ear buds, the battery is surely good. The fitting is also really good. I am a first time user of such earbuds, Im happy that my first purchase and experience is good and totally worth 1700rs. I only regret that its a chinese product.",4
1256,"Very delicate, would not buy it again. Not worth 1299","After using it for 1 day, right earbud stoppped working. They've sent a replacement on 10th Dec, right earbud again stopped working on 17th Dec. I am a fan of redmi /mi but i will not buy it again. Waste of money.",2
1257,Awesome Earbuds ....,"Really one of the best buds in this price range ....
For Music :
Bass is really good and the fit is really good so it creates a good environment listening music.
For Movies:
This was really good when you watching movies on your phone and this where the noise cancellations come in handy ( again noise cancellation depends on how you wear the buds check the extra tips and which is good fit for your ears)
For calling :
Now this is where I was really impressed have to be the best wireless buds for calling for sure. Interiors it gave good sound quality and exterior there was a bit ambience sound involved but still the opposite side could hear me properly.
The build quality also looks good the only thing which would have been great was a C- Type charging port and the best is the charging case which is very small and really good compared to Boat products too .
Overall these are one of the best buds for sure and really quick delivery by Amazon as Mi app is able to order now .
So Amazon thank you for the fast delivery in this tough time and really good product.",5
1258,Best in the market,"Reviewing after a day use.
Best budget earbuds in it’s category.
Excellent battery backup.
Good sound quality with good bass
Fits best in ears.
Mic best placed, the listener and caller can hear properly.",5
1259,GOOD PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE,"First of all, the price is very attractive for the product, i wish to mark my experience as pros and cons
PROS
1)Attractive price
2)Good sound quality
3)Can be used any of the earpieces as single-mode( just remove any of them from the case)
4) fast connectivity, connected as soon as removed from the case
5) good battery backup

Cons
1) No low battery indication or Battery level on the case
2) low-quality case ( but not bad for the price)
3) Very low bass
4) if the case battery drained, the earpieces will be ON even it is inside the case.
5) no charging cable ( not a problem since all are having charging cable for their mobiles)",4
1260,Value for money earbud,"After using 3 days here is my review for redmi 2c earbud

* Light weighted
*5.0 bluetooth quick and amazing connectivity
*Vocal sound and bass is impressive
*Good battery backup ( you can use 4-5 hours continuously without charging)
*Gaming mode option on it
*Nice build quality
*Easy and fast charging
*Overall really good product for this price range
*Only disappointment with this product is that there is no charging cable provided",5
1261,Mediocre..,As u might be knowing quite well.. The build quality isnt very good.. Cheap plastic case and earbuds...the audio quality is kinda mediocre...now some people will say it focuses more on the vocals and bass and etc... But its all a deception.. Sound quality is cheap...plus they dont adhere to your ears firmly...keep getting loose... The charging speed of the earphones(not the case here) is quite fast and so is the drainage speed...in all id say its not the value for money product that everybody claims it is...the price ur paying is for the customer service u can get and the brand name xiaomi...else u can get better earphones at the same price pr even less..its just that those companies font have authorized outlets in every city... I dont recommend these earphones at all...,3
1262,Best Budget TWS,"After searching through a plethora of options when it comes to TWS, I finally decided to go for the trusted Redmi brand.

Inside the box, we have the earbuds itself and the charging case which has a matte black finish and a micro USB charging point. You can charge your earbuds almost three times from 0 to 100 using the case.

Coming to the earbuds, they fit very well and are decent in the sound department considering the price. Bass is not too heavy. Playback time is about 3 hours on full volume and you have playback and calling controls. The mic is pretty good too.

All in all, I'd definitely recommend this for the price and if you're not a gamer, you can choose this over the Redmi earbuds S.",5
1263,"Please dont buy this earbuds, read review for details","Please dont buy this earbuds... I have read all the reviews , literally all the reviews for this product...
One particular issue all mentioned by everyone is ""One earbud not working after few day...""
I went ahead and brought as it might be a batch issue and newer batch will have been improved...
But this issue is still there... First earbuds worked perfectly for 6 days and left earbud stopped working jn middle of a movie and stopped charging also...
So i ordered the replacement at the 9th day of replacement window (Thank god), recieved the second earbud. In the second earbud, left one charged and turned on properly but no sound from it...
Immediately returned it :-(
1. Case and earbuds quality is good.
2. Buttons ar hard to press and causes pain
3.Sound is mediocre but with passable bass quality
4. SERIOUS QA issue... no proper quality test is done i think",1
1264,Buy this at store if u got the problem u can ask them directly.,Am not able to connect the two bugs at a time to my phone. Only single bug was connected and other one is none. Am getting problem with this product. Now I can't replace and cacel the order. Startih also I got the problem even though I suppose to solved it but now I couldn't.,2
1265,Compact convenient clear earbuds,"Fit
Very compact. Fit with mid size buds is comfortable. Feels snug and does not feel like it will fall out for normal movement. Doesn't fall out if head is shaken also.

Sound quality
Good. Bass is fair to good. Loud and clear.

Connection.
Very easy after first pairing - but range is 10 ft only after which drops. Covering ear cuts of the connection sometimes. Mic is good too

Plays for 2 hrs

Overall compactness and quality makes it good value for money",4
1266,Risk!...........not worth taking,"Being a first buyer of this product without any actual reviews seems very risky to me, at first, they worked great...I bought them on Thursday 8th oct and just before posting this review on 12th oct the left earbud suddenly stopped working (as other reviewers mentioned) so....that risk is real...and I think I'm gonna return this product not replace it because its a total gamble (what of the replacement will also stopped working after 4 days) so my advice is just add some more space in your budget and go for better one...pls.. don't buy it...",1
1267,Disappointed,"Only for music lovers, but if you looking for calls specially in outside(even in normal noisy area) , the other party will hear a lot of noise and they keep on complaining. Really disappointed",1
1268,Microphone drops its quality,"Major pros:
-Loud sound
-Light weight
-Perfect fit

Major cons:
-Lose contact inside case
-The microphone is horrible for voice calling it captures the voice all around you and transmits it with the same loudness as your voice
-Cannot be taken out easily due to design flaw
-Multifunctional button has restricted use",2
1269,Value-for-money,"It was worthy Buying. Build quality of charging case & buds are found good. It is very light weighted and fitted inside ear easily. Prompt pairing having Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and strong connection without any dropping issue within the connectivity range of 10 meters. Buds battery lasts for near about 3 hrs at 100% volume on single charge and Buds can be charged 3 times out of the backup of Charging case. A single Bud can also be worked with mono mode and lifting other bud from the charging case it will turn into Stereo mode. As the buds are well fitted in the ears and the volume is sufficiently good external noise is nicely reduced, even if it has no active noise cancellation. Vocals and Bass is excellent justifying the price segment and didn’t find any latency while watching videos on OTT platform.
However, considering other utility features, it is simply price worthy.",5
1270,Connectivity problem,"The product is good with android devices but not good with ios and windows cause i ve been using this produt for about 2 weeks now, though the voice quality and all is good but the problem is with the connectivity whwn i paired it with the iphone it doesn’t worked that well as said by the manufacturer after playing a music and if keep the phone in the pocket of jeans or pants or whatever it is it loses the connection means we wont be able to hear the music clearly and the main problem that i ve noticed the pitch of the music dips at times which was not at all acceptable. when connected with redmi phone it worked well with no noticeable problems with windows device also i noticed above mentioned problem except the connectivity problem",3
1271,Super Awesome,"- It easily gets fit in the ears. First I put them in ears without connecting it with the device. The sleek design itself helps in noise cancellation without playing songs/calls. When it plays songs, the degree of noise cancellation is fantastic.

- Even after a 200m brisk walk, the earphones were intact, and didn't slip down at all.

- Range is superb. I kept my phone in one room and walked 3 rooms past it, and even then it was working. No lagging/voice cut till 10m at least.

- Voice assistance is working fine. Tried 4-5 times playing different songs, it worked.

- Battery life is very good. I have used them for about 3 hours continuously on calls already without charging/keeping in case.

- Buttons require optimum pressure to get tapped, so that if we are adjusting the earbuds, they don't get accidentally clicked. So, complete control of the product in our hand.",5
1272,"Full review. Pros, Cons & Tips to maintain.","Pros:
*The headphones are really pocket friendly. You will spend really less for these. I bought these for INR1,799.
*these are really light in the ears. It weighs really less about 4grams per earbud.
*these have a secure fit in most of the ears. I have really small ears. And these fit perfectly.
* there is no noise cancelation rather it has noise isolation. That means the fit reduces outside noise from entering the ears.
*if you love base, then these are good for you in a budget.
*the charging case is small. It fits all pockets. You can just keep it and forget it.
* The heaphones support SBC or aptX. That means it is clear in some phones that support aptX.

Cons:
*It sometimes disconnects even if the primary device(your phone in this case) is right next to you.
*Even if its connected to your phone it sometimes stops receiving sound or emiting sound to or from your device when you are in a call. You have to reconnect it to fix this problem
* It is not for a prolong use. Your ears will start itching after an hour or two.
*It has one microphone on each heaphones but the other person on a call will not be able to hear you properly if you are in a crowded place or in streets. I use an Iphone and an MI Phone but it is the same in both.
*The charging of the charging case take a lot of time.
* The sound quality is not as pleasing at it should be. The sound is a bit muffled sound. Tere is a lot of base. The mids are somewhat missing. The lows are okayish.
* It charges with micro usb which is an outdated charging type. And the worst part is that they dont include a charging cable in the box.
* The buttons on each earbuds are a bit stiff and you might end up shoving inside your ear canals while trying to press the button.
* The included eartips are of a really cheap quality. Try using any other eartips you like.
* The charging case has over heating issues.

Conclusion: If you really want to buy these headphones then follow some of the tips for the better experience.

Tips:
* Always charge the charging case separately from the earbuds. I recommend to take out your earbuds and use it while you charge the case. When the charging is done, then put the earbuds in the box. Since the box overheats, it might damage your earbuds if you charge the case with the earbuds inside.
* Use a low voltage output to charger. Chargers of these days have a really high voltage output which overheats batteries. Which leads to reduction of the battery capacity. I recommend to use a powerbank or your desktop to charge the charging case.
* Keep your headphones away from any water. However these are rated IPX4 but i recommend not to use these in a normal rain.
You can use it in light drizzles. But it is still risky.
* Dont let the charging case run out of battery. When the case has around 10% to 20% battery, plug the headphones to charge.
* Also dont always keep the battery fully charged all the time. Every battery has a charge cycle. The more you charge the more you loose some of the capacity of the battery.

These are the full review for these MI earbuds S. I hope you like it.",4
1273,Decent earphones from Redmi,"overall the bluetooth headset experience is decent.

Pros:
1. Much better than the other junk out there in truly wireless segment below 2k
2. Connectivity is good. No issues whatsoever
3. Surprisingly microphone on these turned out to be good
4. Decent base

Cons:
1. Sound could have been much better in terms of clarity of voice. It sounds to deep

Overall, i think you can go for this product if you are looking only for truly wireless earphones in this price segment. Its paisa wasool
If you donot care much about truly wireless and just want a wireless earphone, then there are much better options available out there. Oppo enco m31 is one of them.
Do your research before purchasing",3
1274,Not at all recommended.,"Redmi was known for quality products. Ordered it on the day 1 without any doubt.

Now after listening for couple of hours I think I have wasted my money. No bass, only loud music. Fitting is good.

Technical glitches with the case provided. They started falling out of the case easily. Stay connected with the phone even after they are inside the case.

Not at all recommended. Very chip product.",1
1275,Not worth the price.,"I have used it for a few days now and I really liked it. The sound quality is worth the price.
It has Bluetooth 5.0 and connectivity is great.
It worked 3-4 hours on full charge and case once charged can charge the earphones 3 times or more. It is sweat proof! At a time I could keep one earbud in case while use one to listen to AudioBook or anything and when i take out the other earbud it automatically connects and I can hear in both! It has a button on each earbud which can do multiple things like pick up calls, pause music, launch Google assistant! The voice quality is nice on the call. All in all, I am happy with my purchase. Thanks amazon for delivering it so fast!

Update: returned the product because one ear bud stopped working after some time and I had had it replaced once already.",1
1276,"Sleek, light weight and definitely worth buying","Ease of use, light weight. Been using this for about two days now.
Pros:
cute carry case
light weight fits well and wouldn't fall off if you wear the right sized ear buds
Lasts about 2.5 to 3 hours on continuous use
Elegant design.
Clear audio on phone calls. Yet to try the gaming mode.
Noice cancellation is quite decent

Cons:
Picks up ambient noise to the person on the call at the other end.
Would have been better with volume control.",5
1277,Awesome,It's indeed an style statement earphones 🤩 loved it's sleek design and absolutely light weight. Waht I really loved about this was great battery back up . I love to travel and this one comes really handy with excellent notice cancellation. It's even perfect for workout sessions all and all its must buy at awesome price range.totally recommand it,5
1278,Best value for money product.,"Design/Ergonomics:
Comfortable and case is quiet pocketable. No complaints and it fits well in the ears. Eartips material for the price is good but better options are out there.

Sound quality:
The sound quality out the box is pathetic, however it is not due to the driver in general. I own Audio Technica M50x and Sony WF-1000x, both of which sounds amazing however the price point is too high to compare with Redmi and it is not fair to compare also.
It is bass heavy and lot of details in Mids and highs are lost. Even the vocals have been frequency shifted to sound kind of in mid bass region and it is kind of annoying however it will appeal to majority of the people who tends to think more bass means good sound. For majority of the people the sound quality should be fine.
For audiophiles, download wavelet app to set custom EQ. Boost highs and little bit of mids. Fiddle with the app to get a sound signature which you like. You will be more than pleased to know that the driver is quiet capable of sounding good however the out of the box tuning is too bad. But don't expect flagship like audio quality as it is not possible for the driver to sound neutral with EQ adjustments as some coloration or warmness will be always there in the sound. We cannot remove it as it is the driver property and some of the frequencies may not even be produced as it may be very weak and lie below the -10db point. Guess I am getting too boring here. Lets ignore and consider the price point. Sound quality is decent with EQ adjustment. For android users wavelet app can fix sound quality pretty easily however iOS users have to adjust EQ in all the apps.
Connectivity:
For people who says connectivity is bad, they dont know how other truly wireless earphones work. Lot of earphones don't support Bluetooth 5.0 and it needs to have master / slave relationship meaning only one bud would connect with our phone and then it will relay the signal to other bud. This will cause frequent connection drop and very high latency and while watching video there will be a lag in audio. Bluetooth 5.0 is very good in this price point. The connection is very stable. I have not faced any issues and also while watching video there is almost 0 lag. Didn't try gaming but gamers should always use wired headphone for that true latency free exp. I used to get frequent connection drop in sony wf-1000x which i bought for almost 200 dollars (15 thousand Rupees approx). Compared to that this is like gold standard.
Call quality:
Call quality in indoors is pretty good. The person on other side didn't even identify I was speaking on earbuds. Make sure you are waring the earbuds properly with the mic facing your mouth. It is very good in picking our voice however not sure of how it would perform in noisy environment but for the price paid the performance is justified.

Overall:
This is compelling buy at this price point. Highly recommended for anyone to go cords free at a budget. Reducing a star as the sound engineers could have tuned it nicely if they have worked just 1 hour more and taken feedback from people who likes audio.",4
1279,12hrs backup is a lie. It gives you 2.5 hrs backup after 3 months.,"Don't buy 😑 12hrs backup is nonsense. I had to buy an extra pair of realme buds to avoid the constant stress from charging this pathetic device, now it is dead in some corner of my room...for the first few months it will give you 5hrs backup at max...then your your dock will lose its ability to hold charge and your earphone alone will provide 2hrs of charge. Goodluck with 2hrs of songs and 1 hr of charging thins device...if you still think you need an tws earphone save up money buy a good pair of worth 6k and above.(cheap products comes with a painful catch- of all the problems in your life charging should be the last one to give you stress!!)",2
1280,Good sound quality & totally worth earbuds from Redmi,"First of all the sound quality is pretty good. Bass is loud, the highs & lows are clear. Loudness is also good. The sound comes crystal clear & crispy while listening music. Perfect for music lovers.

It has Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity. It connects with smartphone little faster then others. The mic quality is good & call experience is also good.

The build quality is nice. The box & earbuds looks premium. The earbuds fits into ears & creates vaccum if plugged properly, so no worries of falling down.

Gaming experience is also decent on this earbuds. Overall a good earbuds for the price & totally worth from Redmi",5
1281,Overall performance (worth its cost),"I have been using this product simultaneously after it has been delivered.i found that the initial bluetooth connectivity is pretty good cuz I have used a many bluetooth devices and found no one connecting as first as it does.The vocal on the earphones are excellent but the instrument sounds are not clear.The gaming mode works decently and u could easily find a difference between a normal mood and gaming mode while playing the games like PUBG or FreeFire.
Overall the built quality worth its cost and for God's sake it's too light and feels light even with the case itself.(Good work Redmi).
Overall the device is worth its cost and u must see its price range before judging it.
I have also tried random calls and even found the call quality better than realme buds neo(depends person to person).
Thatsall about the product.",4
1282,A bit disappointed.,"When we come to any headphones, the main thing that we focus is on the sound quality. According to my using the Redmi Earbuds S so far, it has made me a little bit disappointed as it was claimed to be. The bass quality is very low and moreover there is also some connectivity issue. The battery backup is good enough though. The mic quality is very bad, no noise cancellation, the other person on call will hear even the speed of your fan .",3
1283,First order review.,"Ordered it on the very first day and below is the detailed score:

Bluetooth connectivity: 5/5
Sound quality: 4/5
Design: 5/5
Charging time: 4/5
Overall quality: 4.5/5

One should definitely buy, totally worth the price. 👌🏻",4
1284,Big Fan ❤️,"Amazing product. It's so light in weight that doesn't even feel anything when weared. Classy case with high end look. Great highs and lows with good base. Has great battery backup. The case usually takes 2-3 hours to charge and helps in sound backup. Ear Pods once charged can give upto 2 hours of backup.

I would have appreciated if it had touch controls instead of push button.",5
1285,COMPLETE HONEST REVIEW,"Guys COMPLETE HONEST REVIEW.

1286,Best wireless earphones under 2k,These are the best wireless earphones under 2k. The sound and bass quality is great and it cancels the external noise. It connected really well with my one plus 6 phone and battery life is also good enough. I definitely found it worth the price and would recommend it to all looking for budgeted good quality wireless earphones.,5
1287,Impressive TWS,"My First Ever TWS, That's too From My Favourite Brand. So I'm a Bit Nostalgic. The Design is Clean and Simple. The Charging Case is Very Compact and Lightweight. Even The TWSes are Extremely Lightweight. One Multi Function Button on Each Earbud Helps You to Control All The Functions. I Liked Its Sound Signature. It Has Loud and Clear Sound With Ample Amount of Bass and Nice Treble. Vocals are Pretty Clear Too. Battery Backup is Excellent. It Has Fast and Stable Connection Due To Its Latest Bluetooth 5.0 . The ENC Works Fine in It. It Can Be Used Even While Exercising and Taking Bath as It's IPX4 Rated Sweat and Splash Proof. Besides It's Very Easy to Pair and Can Be Used as Stereo or Mono Mode. The Voice Assistant Also Works Perfectly. I'm Very Impressed.",5
1288,Mind blowing purchase!!! Simply Awesome!! Go for it!!,"Pros:
Noise cancellation better than other brands.
Sound is loud enough while playing music and videos.
No lags (while playing videos). Games not tested.
Battery backup is good.
After 100% charge, listened to 18 songs (approx
1.5 hour) Stilll 60% batttery remaining.
Case charged only once.
Cons:
No charging cable provided.
Would have better if the charging case had lights showing battery percentage remaining in the case as seen in powerbanks.

Must go for it. Using it with Redmi Note 8 Pro.",5

1290,Very very very worst product,"After hearing somebad good nd bad news abt this product finally i hav ordered this product bcz i liked at this price.
But after usafe 1 day frm very next day the right earbud is stopped working like other buyers hav also experienced this... so plzzzz stop buying this product ... Redmi is loosing its brand value by providing this kind of bad products to d custumers.
One more thing we can only charge buds 2 times from d chargimg case ..means it will give only 6-7 hrs backup only instead of 12hrs..",1
1291,Close Your Ears and Buy Them!!,"After returning two products; a Mivi and then Boatz bluetooth wireless headphone I had almost lost hope on these especially at this price level. I thought 1500 or so must be connection issues/earpiece quality being bad because of that but Redmi Earbuds S are spectacular!
Great Aspects:
1. Nice compact packaging
2. Sleek Design
3. Sexy Case
4. Awesome Sound Quality
5. Mic/recording volume and Quality is the great.

No Complaints. Only wish these could connect simultaneously to my phone, that would make this the best device there is in this wireless earphones segment. #MustBuy",5
1292,"Overall average product. Compared to this fact, price is high","The audio quality for this earbud is good. I am not a fan of high bass, so what it provide is good for me. It may vary for others.
The noise cancellation on microphone is not good, it picks a lot of background noise and even if there is no background sound, the audio quality on the other side is not crisp.
Another feature which I don't like is disconnecting the buds from phone by placing it inside the charging box. When the charging box does not have any charge, it cannot disconnect the buds. And this magnetic blocking does not work always either even if the box is full of charge. You need to open the box, adjust the position of the buds inside the box and close it again. So this needs attention from the manufacturer.",4
1293,Below average,This is a really average product. There is too much noise over calls. I started using for office calls and I got an escalation for too much noise disturbance. No one will ever talk to you over calls if you use this earphones. OK ish for music.,1
1294,Good product is budget but not suitable for gaming...,"This is a review after 1 month of usage.
Pros-
• Comfortable fit in ear.
• Noise cancellation is average.
• Mid tones are clear ( can be used for watching movies or video conferencing,etc)
•The case quality is good.
•Battery life is decent in daily usage.
• Instant and good range in Bluetooth connectivity.
•Portable and handy is daily usage.

Cons-
• No Type-c port for charging.
• Though it supports gaming mode( which gets activated on triple tap on either earbuds) the latency still persist.
•The lid quality of case not good, however it won't break if you are not a rough user.
• Colour options not available.
•Made in china( no offence)

Overall I recommend this.",3
1295,Value for money!,"Hello, Giving honest review about this earbuds
This are really too good under 2k this is the one of best u found.
Lets talk about details-
1) Sound - 4/5
2) battery- 5/5 for home use otherwise 4/5
3) Bass - 4/5 As I excepted its really cool.
4) Noise cancellation - 5/5 this is one of best thing I found in this earbuds.
Now If You are confuse between Earbuds I will suggest you to buy this because under 2k you will not find any otherone.
If your budget is under 4k then there are other earbuds available which may be Better than this but i think you will not find any big difference Between them.
Review is based on my opinion it may varies further i.e may be in favour with you or not!",4
1296,Value for money,"Considering the fact that it's below 2k, the product is at par for what you pay.

Note - charging cable is USB 2.0 (Not type - C, so it may be a hassle if you are using a type - C smartphone)

Overall a good product, the battery back up is amazing.",4
1297,Good but not the best,"These are good pair of true wireless headphone buy not the best when comparing at its competitors at the same price. I bought this and was disappointed. Sound quality is decent. Not ideal for gaming it has noticable latency while palying battle royale games. Battery backup is poor lasted about 3hrs. The one which I received, it's left button was loose. Button clicks cannot be customised too. I had to return the product because of the all these disappointments. There are good alternatives with better sound quality and good battery life at the same price.",3
1298,One of the worst products pf MI,"I purchased this product with very high hopes. However, with the first usage itself the hopes were dashed. The product is brilliant for listening to music, but for calls it's worthless as it doesn't have mouse cancellation feature as advertised. The person on the other side would hear the background noise unless you are at a place where not even the wind is blowing. After I talk for 40-45 mins I face a lot of disturbance while hearing the other person's voice. It charges quickly, it's very light. Google assistant doesn't works properly. I had to return it twice. The first time was a replacement after I got a more degraded product. I returned it the second time today and Amazon told me that my money would be refunded.",2
1299,Decent purchase,"I wont rate it bad, its a pretty decent product. At this price range, its quite amazing. However i found some issues with the syncing of buds with each other and buds going powered off suddenly, but it has happened only once since my purchase. (I bought it about a month back). The sync issue gets fixed when you put the buds back in the container. SO i am happy with the purchase and expecting it to perform well for months to come.",4
1300,OVERALL SATISFIED,"First of all I would like to say.... THEY ARE SOOOO CUTE!!!!
They fit in my palm and feel so awesome to hold!
The noise cancellation is so good !
I would have been smitten if it had more colour choices...
Now for the Bad part...
Sometimes the voice starts breaking and sometimes the earbuds stops working...
It happens rarely but it does happen...",4
1301,Mi ear buds.,It works very well with mi phones but didn't tried on other make. Sound quality is fine with no noise. But there is problem when connected with Samsung TV there is fading effect even in sport mode. Other blue tooth device works fine with tv.,4
1302,"""Best earbuds in this price range"",Happy customer.","Overall it is the best earbuds in this price range.
Game mode is working very good.
Strength of the charging case can be increased.
Bass quality is good and clear vocals.
Good noice isolation.

The only problem for me is package is deformed during shipping. But no damages on product.
And may include a laser / colour printed invoice otherthan a termal printed invoice.it will be good for future reference.",4
1303,OKAY FOR MUSIC BUT NOT FOR OTHER PURPOSE,"Plus points

. They are okay for music
. You can watch videos on youtube without any delay in sound
. Battery is normal with playtime of almost 3 to 3 and a half hours
. The ups and downs in the music are clear with instruments heard properly
. They fit properly in ear

Negatives
. The sound gets distorted when the volume is at the max
. Don't like them for games as there is a delay of sound for almost a second
. Low bass as compared to ptron bassbuds
. Noice cancellation is low and the other person can hear the sound of surroundings which is disturbing.

Overall rating by me 3 out of 5",3
1304,One earplug stops working and charging every now and then!,"The quality is not upto the mark as we have seen for other Redmi products. One earbud stops working completely and doesn't even charge when put in case. In my case, it has happened for both Left and Right earbuds in last 10 days. Took to mi service center twice and I am told that this is a known issue. They somehow reset the earbuds and they start working again, but it is a hit and trial method and doesn't rectify the issue. They even refused to replace the earbuds, as they somehow reset it everytime and returned in working condition.

How to reset: Clean the charging points on earbuds and the case. Put the case on charging and only place the earbud which is not working. Long press the multifunction button on earbuds. If you are lucky, the red light will be turned on. Give it a couple of tries if doesn't work at once.

Disclaimer: The above hack was told by a service centre executive and holds no guarantee to rectify the inherent issue.

Advice would be not to buy this product. Instead go for a slightly higher priced good quality product.",2
1305,Became unserviceable in just 8 days,"One of the earbuds became unserviceable just after the return window was closed.
Charging connector is micro USB whereas most of the newer mobile phones use USB type-C connector.
If you walk with Earbuds in ear, you may listen your thumping sound of walking, if you chew something you may hear its sound too.
In short I am totally disappointed with the quality.
Edit: U/S Earbuds were replaced by Mi Service Center.",1
1306,Worth the price,"One of the best true wireless earphones under 2k, even if they overpriced it in India , I would say it’s worth it.
Pros -
1. Vocals sound simply amazing ! Highs , mids , simply awesome !
2. These are really small and very compact, when I got these in my hands I was like daaayyymmmn tis tiny ! The case is very small that I misplaced it somewhere and couldn’t find it
3. The fit is just perfect, you can’t even feel it in your ears
4. Gaming mode - it actually works ! I’ve tried the realme buds air with gaming mode and I’ve got to say these are on point to it. PUBG and COD is just flows very smoothly, giving a lag free gaming experience
5. Connectivity is also amazing

Cons-
1. Built quality, the feel and look extremely cheap, the lid of the case is all wobbly, I think it’s gonna Break
2. Bass, the bass is alright but when listening to some songs it sounds like someone farting,
3. Battery life is just average
4. With gaming mode on the battery gets drained pretty quickly
5. No charging cable in the box, but who doesn’t have a micro usb cable these days ? 😏

At the end, I would recommend this with all my heart.",4
1307,If you want to feel music.... Then please don't buy this ....,"First time I'm feeling regret by purchasing this earbuds ...I already have 3 mi earphones , one boat earphones too... But this one is too worse in sound quality...too much distortion... There's not even a clarity in sound....
Well the only thing i can say is comfortable wearing only upto 5-10 minutes after that you'll get pain in your ears....",2
1308,A big yes..!!!,"One of the best product in this range which doesnt hit your pocket much. Have started using the earbuds since quite a few days and found a very good and decent quality of sound which doesn't hit hard on your ears, comfortable to put it on, quick pairing with the device one is using, very light in weight and easy to carry case, battery backup is really as the way they have mentioned in their description, you can use one earbud even at a time which depends completely on your requirement or work, easy for the people who regularly travel, working in office or home, during workout or walk. Overall happy with the product and it's quality and also got delivered quickly.",5
1309,Best Earbuds in market !,"I am using this product from a couple of hours, and it's already my favourite earbuds of all. Noise cancellation is great, it is sweat proof while running, has long battery life and comes with a sleek design. All this at THIS price point. What else we want !",5
1310,Great sound quality earbuds with bass,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I have been using these Redmi earbuds for over a week now and the sound quality is quite impressive, at this price the bass and noise cancellation is also quite good, the battery of the charge pod is over 2 days and can be used for long hours as well.",5
1311,Awesome earbuds under rs2000.,"Under Rs2000. I think this is the best earbuds.
Pros:
1.The sound quality 4.5/5.
2.light weight.
3.battery backup 4.5/5
4.this is Ipx4 certified.
5.Game mode and many more.
6.No issues of connectivity.
7. And very low littency.(playing pubg).
8. Noise cancellation is pretty good job.
Cons:
1. There are no micro USB cable.
2. And the charger case has no battery back up indicator. But charging indicator is included.
3. And after use the charging case is a little bit loose.
But I suggest you go for it. This is a good deal and value for money.",4
1312,Waste of money,"It was pretty good at the beginning. The battery lasted for 5 hours at first. The sound quality was decent and was appreciably loud. But after a few months, the battery lasts only 30 mins; it dips from 100% charge to 10% charge and after 10 mins it is completely dead. The sound has also decreased to about half; even full volume now sounds quite low. There are connectivity issues where you have to restart it multiple times to connect both earbuds. The sound is now also uneven in the two earbuds.

TL;DR: Don't buy if you are looking to keep it around for more than a few months.",1
1313,Left bud stopped working after 5 days,Despite good sound quality in given price point product is useless as LHS bud stopped working after 5 days of use. After replacing the product same issue happened after a week of using without any problem. Now the replacement period is over don't know what to do with this garbage.,1
1314,It does not sit in the ears.. Falling down..,"It does not sit in my ears.. Always falling down.. Sound quality is super.. Battery backup is super.. Everything good but when I put it in my ears I should stand steady. If I turn my head it will fall down... I need a sticky tape to fix it in my ears... Anyone else having same problem..?

Second problem is I need lot of effort to take it from box.. Now I keep a paper clip inside the box to take earbuds from it. I am not able to pull it out with fingers. Need paper clips.

I regret my choice..",1
1315,Good Surround sound with mediocre (but satisfying) bass,"The product is really nice considering the price. However I really wish the build quality of the charging case was better. I don't know for sure but it seems like it will definitely break if dropped so it must be handled with care. The lid is slightly wobbly but doesn't look like it might come off anytime soon. As for the sound, really satisfying and smooth. The buds are very lightweight and perfectly fits in the ear. Battery life is great. The only concern is the case which is very delicate. Otherwise nice product",4
1316,Not good for calls,"Sound seems to travel between the two pods. Specially when you are on a call, sound drops and then keeps shifting between both pods. Besides, people complain of echo and strong background noise in the call. I bought them for calls mainly, but doesn't seem to work. Thanks Amazon for returning.",3
1317,Product was damaged. Request for Replacement,"1) I found the product was in a damaged condition of box. It doesnt look like brand new.
2) Once after opening the box, i felt it was already in a opened condition
3) There was only one pair of earbuds in the box; the other pair was only one earbuds
4) Bass was not that good as listedned from my friends same redmi earbuds
Overall i need a replacement with a brand new genuine product",3
1318,Literal good for the price,"I mean like it is everything that you would get in 1800/- think of a product with a almost good audio quality and better features of tws! The calls work fine and the music is good!
The best thing I like here is the auto-turn off thing you place them back in the box close the lid and boom disconnected!
Also the one piece at a time feature is good too!
The handling of the ear piece like taking it out part only seems a bit diff! Because of the desing but other than it's cool!
The connectivity with each other is impressive here in this budget!
Also the latency! Like idk abt others but I feel that the buds are pretty good with handling that.
The countdown timer in cod or pubg works exactly with the sound and i kind of like it.",5
1319,Mi has done it again,"I think, it is worth for 1800 Rs. You don't get the even the good wireless earphones under this price and Mi is giving you truly wireless that too with Multiple features. Very handy and comfortable in my ears.

The only problem with this earphone is during calls the background noise is so much that you can't bear.",4
1320,A cheap solution,"The left ear bud sound is lesser than the right bud. The charging box is cheap plastic and flimsy and scratches easily.
The quality of the rubber tips is bad.

Over all only good if u want to upgrade from cheap local wired headphones to a wireless ones

The mic is ok and if the caller can't hear u y can always take out one bud and bring it close to your mouth to talk

Battery life is as mentioned on the ad.

The gaming mode is really good with minimum lag noticed.",3
1321,Clear sound with superior bass,"Awesome earbuds with superior sound quality with powerful bass. The earbuds and light in weight, I even can't feel it after some time. Build quality is good and earbuds looks sturdy. Case cover feels premium. There is a button on each bearbuds, which are soft and easy to press. At this price point, it is value for money product.",5
1322,Perfect 😍😉,"After using these buds for few days here's my review:

1. Sound quality is good, the bass and treble both felt perfect.
2. Bass works really well in high bass mode in my phone equaliser.
3. Sound sync is perfect between left/right and sound clarity is decent.
4. Calling works perfectly and mic with noise cancellation feels clearer at other end which makes conversation effective.
5. Grip on ears is good, you can put these on while walking/jogging gives a different level workout spirit.
6. Battery backup is decent with case, with one full charge it can charge earbuds 4-5 times.
7. Earbuds battery life is good approx 3.5 hours while listening music, 2.5 hours with Gaming.
8. It comes with touch controls on both earbuds with many functions Like call
answer/reject, music controls ,volume control.

Overall it is the best earbud in this price range according to overall performance.",5
1323,Edited ! Stopped working in 5 days. Overall value for money with few cons.,"Pros -
- Price
- light weight
- small form factor of case
- connects automatically
- doesn’t fall easily
- good call quality
- plugs block lot of sounds.

Cons-
- mediocre sound, mids and highs are muted so music sounds very soft with bass. I use equalizer to bring out details. I primarily use Audio technica m40x, and apple earpods. Bought Redmi 2c just for convenience.

- uncomfortable for me. Even the smallest tip hurts my ear canal.

- buttons are hard to press

Overall value for money. Wish they were more comfortable to wear. I might return it due to that.

Edit:

Right bud suddenly stopped working in just 5 days.",1
1324,Great sound quality. Value for money,"Perhaps one of the best budget TWS available in market.
This product is really good in terms of quality and price is also very reasonable unlike other TWS available in market. Bass is good enough and natural. Lightweight and fits easily in ear. Latency is also decent. Must buy",5
1325,Worth the price,"In this price I don’t think anyone could get a better product than this. The sound quality is good enough and the design is very basic. Charging is quiet efficient and a little lag is there during phone calls because of the microphone placement. Rest all is good.
One advice to all buyers - if you are comparing this product, please make sure you compare within the near price limits. It makes no sense to compare a 5k product’s features with this product (came across few people doing this, so just sharing it).",5
1326,One of the best valued for money TWS in this price range.,"The sound quality is better than I expected. It delivers punchier bass and non distorted treble even at the fullest volume. The built quality feels premium.
The noise cancellation is great. You can barely hear the surrounding noises even at low volumes.
However the buds does not fit perfectly into the ears. It feels like the buds are gonna fall from ears but still it is manageble.
The calling experience was decent, not that great but ok.

If you are looking for a great sound quality TWS in budget, go for it.

Thanks.
I hope it was helpful.",4
1327,After Using for more than a month on Mobile phone and laptop,"Summed Up Opinion - Value for money product with very satisfactory audio quality for Music and Calling when used on Mobile Phone.Not recommended for gaming.

Detailed Opinion -:
+Nice Sound quality for Music
+Satisfying Calling Quality on both ends

-Has pairing issues : 1) at times it abruptly gets disconnected for no reason
2) pairing gets very difficult even though you are doing everything correct
- Not for gaming : audio lags and in turn your game lags
- Sound distortion : music/sound distorts and at times re-pairing doesn't ends the distortion.",4
1328,Value for money,"This is best value for money earbuds. You don't get anything in this price range currently.

Pros:
1.good battery backup. Lasts upto 3 hrs with 80% volume!!!
2.Sound quality is good enough and is having more focus on vocals than music. This helps in calls and other videos like movies, reviews etc.

Cons:
1. Bass is not high and more like plain earbuds.
2. No volume increase or decrease or track change on earbuds.

Thanks,",5
1329,Poor connectivity with Apple products,"Sound quality and noise cancellation is a little disappointing and quite frankly tolerable at this price range but the real dealbreaker is bluetooth connectivity which for some is poorer than a 3 year old beats wireless headset.
Though my experience with using it on andriod (asus zenfone M1) has mostly been satisfactory (possibly because I don't use my phone much) to say the least but I've experienced disconnection, varying latency, strange irking background noise and pods strangely pausing with apple devices notably macBook pro and iPad (7th gen) which makes the whole experience very pesky and annoying.",2
1330,Quality Concerns : Stopped Working within a Week,"Stopped working within a week.

Never wondered Redmi Products will not last even for a week.

One ear PC's has stopped working and unable to connect even after reseting.

Also to surprise this has a replacement window of just 7 days where as all products have a 10 day window.

I assumed it to be 10 days and didnt put the request at same time and now nothing can be done.

Think twice before buying.",1
1331,Decent product,I received the earbud on 16 this in just 12 hrs from Order. It is amazing 😍😍😍 no doubt the package and the delivery was too good 😎 and the sound quality is also awesome and the earbud is also good it was proper set in ears I used for my office use for meeting and was Continuesly was hearing music and movie for the 5 Hrs battery 🔋 backup is also good.. Must buy it in affordable price no one can give such quality thanks to MI,5
1332,GOOD TWS EARPHONES,"Redmi Earbuds S 👍 for a budget of under 2000/-
Pros:
1)1799/- seems to be a justifiable price due to the lack
of competition in this price range
2) Decent sound profile in all three ranges
3) really lightweight and fits like a glove..even during
exercisee or running, it doesn't tend to fall out
4) Decent battery life as promised (3 and a half hours in
real life
5) Low latency gaming mode works just fine

Cons:
1) Nothing spectacular to say about the microphone
2) Prone to damage if dropped, judging by the plastic
build quality
3) Slight distortion at maximum volume

Side note: If you want to tweak the buttons on the Redmi Earbuds S, use Mobdroid app to reconfigure the button functions. I rarely use voice assistant, which is given as the double tap function. So I used Mobdroid to reconfigure double tap to play the next song.🤗",4
1333,Important features missing.,The buttons on the side of the earpods are very tactile and feel nice but the problem is. There is no good feature in this earpods. The button Opens Google Assistant and nothing else. No pause or skip or rewind for the song you're listening to. The sound quality is good and the volume is also nice but the lack of features makes it kinda lame at it's price.,2
1334,Excellent bluetooth from the redmi,"Excellent wireless bluetooth Perefectly fits into the ear's sound quality is excellent and noise cancellation is good bass is normal
Worth for the money massive product from the Redmi, love to use this, during workout also it fits into the ear's without missing, battery backup is also descent enough to continue for the whole day in the bass capsule",5
1335,Case cannot be charged using the powerbank,"After using this product for 2 days I am facing certain issues. Firstly the case cannot be charged using a powerbank though surprisingly it is getting charged with a cell phone charger adapter.
After using both the earbuds for sometime I am facing a kind of loose connection in between the movies or music audio and the earbuds.
Build quality is bellow average espically the case is pathetic.
Also faced pairing issues once or twice.
Sound quality is average.
I paid around 1500 for this device, though it's cheap but such quality was not expected from a brand like Xiaomi",2
1336,Pretty decent one,Yes.. Finally got the one. The review i post after one week of using. The sound quality is pretty descent which is you are the bass lover. The hate the in-Ear Buds but I tried once. It's not suitable. Can't bold the Buds more then 30mins. It's irretitare my ears. The push buttons not gud idea. Anyways if you are bass lover. Just go for it.,4
1337,"Dont buy, right side stops working after some time","I bought them on 30 November, on that day they worked fine ,at night I left them in box,in morning when I used them the right side one wasn't working no lights no nothing,I checked online many many people had the same problem.but in time I used them their sound quality was good.But I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY THEM",1
1338,Best Entry level TWS,"Redmi Earbuds S
__________________

1 week review :
One of the cheaper options with a brand name.
So I decided to get it with high expectations (of returning it).
Sound->
----------
Priced at INR 1799 the sound is pretty loud that no one would complain.
It's got decent bass too.
At this price point, I won't complain about the sound
It's a definite yes 👍🏻
Build and Fit - >
-------------------
Given the price it exceeds expectations.
Plastic matte finish is kinda nice. Opening and closing the case is satisfying. I had to switch to the smallest ear buds to make it fit. It's a pretty good fit and didn't fall off while working out as well. It did irritate my left ear after prolonged use(My left ear is unique 🤭 and it often happens).
Battery life - >
----------------
Without case - Approx 4 hrs
With case - ×3 = 12 hrs.
Using 1 earbud at a time can extend your life and that's a neat option at this price.
Pros->
-------
*Double tap for assistant works on Google, Siri and Cortana
*Good sound
*Bluetooth 5.0
Cons>
----------
*While pairing with my phone i faced an issue where I don't get the notification sound regularly. It's a hit or miss.
And while interacting with media volume controls keep popping up. This happens sometimes. Sometimes it's fine.
*Micro USB (But yeah it's dirt cheap)

Overall Rating : 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑 (That's 4 on 5) and I'm not returning it. .",4
1339,Good price point,"Great deal for the price! The Redmi earbuds are a good buy for this price!

Easy pairing and installation, charges quickly and sound quality is crystal clear.

While the bass sounds are not as vivid, these earbuds are extremely functional and am very happy with this purchase!",5
1340,Good for some bad for many some reasons,"Te product is good as per the price and has good sound quality the main disadvantage of the product is i u are going to have this to make calls jist dont go for it the mic quality is poor next person cant hear what are u saying even in very less crowded places
And this product feels very cheap to hold and the charging case get scratched very easy",3
1341,Value for money earbuds,It’s a great product. I am using wireless earbuds for the first time and I am satisfied with the product. I have been using it mostly while working out and it doesn’t come off at all. Mic is also great so no problem in that area too. Overall a great product for the price.,5
1342,Awesome sound and awesome fit,"UberCool product... Thanks a lot Xiaomi for introducing such a wonderful product in the Indian market...
Real good sound with awesome noise blocking...
It's very good for talking to someone and never falla off your ears while running.... Simple awesome and 5 stars...",5
1343,Don't buy!,"Build quality is okok
Sound quality Is of like roadside earphones
Bluetooth connectivity is good
Noise cancellation is also not that great but good
Overall not recommed to buy coz cost is more than its performance.. expecting a goof sound quality but there was no proper surround so it degraded the quality of sound..",3
1344,Not working right one,"Right airdot of my redmi airbuds s goes dim red light when placed in case compared to the bright red light in the left one and does not charge. Been using this airdots in more than a month and its been woking well until the issue suddenly arise. Did not drop the case even once and I am very careful to protect it.

The right airdot is currently empty and wont charge. If anyone could help/guide me fixing this i would greatly appreciate it.",1
1345,Best in this price range,"Pros :
Light weight
Hassle free connection
No charging problem
Low latency mode
Great built up quality
Decent sound
Cons:
Low bass
Tips:
Just read in the instruction manual careful before using .",4
1346,Best & must buy product if you’re looking for earbuds..!!,"I must say, Redmi Earbuds are Super in Performance in range upto 4k.

I tested indoor, outdoor & also during Running outside. I find it snug fit in my ears.

Decent Volume & Bass. Sounds Clear in full volume as well.

Overall satisfied.",5
1347,Best Value for your Money,"Good quality sound, even bass. The buds come with different sized rubber nubs to fit your ears perfectly. Keeps out all background noise so you get a completely immersive experience. Charging case looks so Cool and charging is so easy; just drop your buds in the correct side, charging will start automatically. Pairing of earbuds happens automatically when you take them out again. I definitely love them and would highly recommend them.",5
1348,Good for listening music but not for calling.,"This earpiece actually is good from a quality perspective.I'm rating 3 because the earpiece doesn't fit properly into our ears and secondly this is good for listening music but when you try to use this for calling the Mic pics all the sound around us which makes the listener uncomfortable who is on call on the other side with us.
If these 2 issues are sorted out this is definitely a very good product.",3
1349,***NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL ***,"1) I bought this product on the day of its launch, got delivered in two days as promised. Intially the buds worked well for 5-6 hours then started lagging after very seconds, Noise cancellation feature was also not working. I ordered for the replacement which I got next day in the morning.
That day means yesterday it worked well, was not having any problem which the first one had.
But the second day today when I started using it, the right Earbuds doesn't connect to the phone. As displayed in the pictures submitted, the right earpod was not even charging also not even connecting to any of my phones.
Had very much expectations with these cool budget friendly earbuds but it resulted into a total waste of money.
***NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL***",1
1350,Not happy,This product is not value for money. Music is good but you can't clearly hear the instrument separation. Bass is pretty decent not much. The main issue with its connectivity. The audio breaks sometimes. Sometimes when you cover your phone with your hand audio will cracking. That's strange. I first replace that product because I thought the piece was damage but again the buds came with same issue. So unfortunately I am returning them and wanted my refund ASAP. Thankyou.,2
1351,Very third class product so disappointed after using it for a week.,After a week of using it the left bud stopped working I wouldn't recommend this plz do not buy. The guidelines to restart the buds is useless. I would like to replace it but I don't know why the return window was closed early as compared to other products. This is really not fare . I felt cheated atleast it could have worked for six months as per price I have paid for it. Really not expected this from such a good prestige company. Not fare .,1
1352,Good earbuds under 2000,"Pros -
Lightweight

Value for money to some extent

Led notifications looks nice

Sound quality is good, but works best with equalizer

Yes, there is a sort of noise cancellation present.

Cons-
Due to matt finish it is slippery, very slippery

Works well with mobile devices, tried with PC, but sound quality was not that good on high pitches.",4
1353,"Good earphones, worth the low price","Initial review.
Just received the product. Build quality is good, better than I expected. The audio quality is good. It dropped 10% battery in 5-6 mins so not sure of the battery duration on this. Will review that bit later. Not bulky on the ears and remain in tact even while jumping. The buttons on the buds sometimes get pressed unintentionally though. Overall good product.",4
1354,"Sound Quality is good , Manual should contain FAQs.","It's been just 15 days. One of the right buds stop working. We earlier bought redmi airbuds S، which is working fine۔

After going thru the FAQ section in product page found below step to do hard reset. But in the product booklet no mention of hard reset , that is bad.

I followed the steps and it resolved it. Changed the rating from 1 to 4. As sound quality is good. Only thing they should provide more details about resetting.

Hardware reset steps:

· Long press and hold Multi-function button when earbud is out of case. Keep pressing, do not release. Put earbud into the case (do not release, keep pressing). Don't release until observe the LED turns red",4
1355,Best product for those who wants to buy true wireless earbuds,Amazing Sound Quality with a brilliant voice assistant.. even if I play a high graphical game.. there's no lag in sound. It does not provide touch screen facility in receiving calls & for other activities so it does not consist the problem of cutting calls by mistake of touch or anything.. its battery backup is also too good.... so I would suggest if you're looking for true wireless earbuds for routine & every kind of use.. this is the product you should definitely buy!,5
1356,Just one suggestion. Plz don't buy.,"Bad product this time. People's at other complaints about noise low volume and non clarity. Noise cancellation is almost zero. I have to search close and silent place if I want to call with these earbuds. Battery backup also not up to the mark, its is just OK. Rs. 1799 is too much for this product. Better to buy some other brands earbuds if don't want to waste your money.",3
1357,"Poor quality, don't buy","My experience with the product is not so good.
Initially for a 2-3 weeks I found good as these are my first TWS earbuds, was pretty excited using it but as the time passes understood the issues
1. Not comfortable for more than 2 hour long
2. No proper sound isolation ( with all the rubber buds supplied with this )
3. Sound quality is also getting deteriorated after 70% battery left
4. Sometime connectivity issues, dropping 1 ear sound, sometimes dip in the sound for 1 second in every 10 sec

Basis above I recommend these shall not to bought.

1358,"Pocket-friendly, lightwieght earbuds for everyone who has eyed Apple earpods!","If you are a Xiaomi user and already understand its value for money products, you are probably going to love these earbuds. Anyone who wants to experience wireless earplugs must buy these budget-friendly earbuds. Connected supremly easy, are very light weight, there are ear cushions in various sizes making it all the more easier for you to be comfortable while wearing these. Bass is pretty good too, don't think too much and go ahead with these!",5
1359,Left earpiece doesn’t work!,"The left earpiece didn’t work at all.
CS team denied the service too. Pathetic product. Do not buy!!!",1
1360,Make way for the best earbud from Redmi,"I have been using this Redmi Earbuds for past 3 days, TBH I am really satisfied. The bass is excellent and sounds are in perfect balance. The noise cancellation works really well, during call also I don't hear any disturbing sounds.
The battery backup is a plus, I just charged single time and I used it for 10-hours with the charging case. Coming to the Bluetooth connectivity, I didn't face any issues. The connectivity is smooth and hassle free.

Overall this earbud exceeded my expectation. Have no second thoughts, just go for it.
I will surely recommend this product to my friends and family.",5
1361,Not so good product ( after use 6 month),"Sound quality is average. Not good according to its price.
Latency is actually notisible even in game mode.

Bass is feel like zero. Bass level are extremely low accept this price.
After 6 month of normal use the battery of the charging case is dead. Battery is very cheap.

I suggest don't buy this , you waist your money nothing eles.
Go for realme z or buy any coller bluetooth earphone , that are far better sound quality and battery in this price",3
1362,Review,"These are one of the best widely earphones which u can get anywhere for this price .
Its very user friendly ,don't even hesitate about this giving u a problem.
If u are a person who listens to music everyday, then these are your type of wireless earphones.

CONS-
U can't change songs with the earbuds which is really kinda sad
Can't control the volume on these with the earbuds also

PROS-
Active noise isolation
Pairs up easily
Won't break even if it accidentally fall off",5
1363,Ok product but not Great,Worst one. after 14 days of usage left one stopped working and there is no response from either MI further. Useless,3
1364,OMG After reading reviews I thought they are unlucky,"OMG left earbud is not working... When I read all the reviews I thought they are unlucky, but reality is there is some serious issues with Earbud..
Left is not switching on at all, is this software issue or hardware issue, pathetic, don't go for it...",1
1365,Product can be used for short time,"Bud are very light weight and not comfortable set in the ears. There is distortion in the voice while playing music . The manual show only 4hrs backup for buds and 12 hrs charging pod, overall experience is ok",3
1366,Loved it ! Great Sound Great Look 💕,"I completely loved this at its first look.The matte box with a little shine makes the packaging so elegant.Aldo the features are really great , the sound quality ,the noise cancellation and the bass quality are just commendable. Also the fact that the earphone gets charged in the box makes it even more convenient to use and the also the size of the product makes it travel friendly ... You can keep it in you pockets as well .Great product 💕💯 Highly recommended 💖👌",5
1367,DON'T BUY IF YOU.....,"For people who want to buy redmi earbuds so listen this earbuds is just waste of your money.
1. Main problem is that battery backup of this earbuds only 3.5 hours 😑
2. Sound quality is not good and bass is normal means sound quality is like 200-300rs earphones.
3. On calling voice is not cleared also noise cancelations is not worthy.
4. Everytime stuck in music.
So basically this earbuds is not useful for music and not useful for calling just waste of your money don't buy this i returned my product in 1 day.",2
1368,My experiences was this product like or dislike part,"Like 👍
Sound quality great 😚
Extra Vocal in Extra bass.
Easy to carry & lightweight.
Fitting awesome. No any pain in ear using long time.

Dislikes👎
Calling experience poor. ☹️
Lot of noise. The caller facing lots of noises.
Calling receiving experience was good. Clear to know how to speak ok I want of your.",3
1369,Value for money Earbuds,"A purely value for money product - if you want to test whether this type of Earbuds suits you in day to day life - go for it , above average battery backup , good voice quality but not so good noise cancellation and music bass output",5
1370,First use experience,"Sound is good; if you’re listening to a video or song. While placing a call, background noise is not really filtered at all; and pretty much every background sound goes out to the listener. So if you’re going to be speaking on calls using this, be sure to have a silent backgrounds. Ok otherwise.",3
1371,Best Bluetooth Earbuds in Budget,"Finally Purchased this Redmi earbuds, sound quality good.
No issue in connectivity. Gave a decent battery back up. No disturbance while calling, but you will receive good sound while talking to someone.
In ear fitting is great.

Better quality.",5
1372,Honest review by Krish Modi,"This is a honest review after 3 days of it's use... I would like to tell that these earbuds are unbelievable and I can't imagine that it's so small and so much powerpacked with quality.
The case is a bit loose after some uses but thankfully it doesn't gets lose or opened . Just a reminder after buying.. If the case gets a bit loose don't get scared.. Because it's a general problem of all the earbuds case.",5
1373,Average product,"Genuine review :Product quality is not good.. Battery life is not as expected.. Sound quality is good.. Most time fail to connect automatically.. Fits in your ear perfectly. Unable to change tracks which is a downside. Noise cancellation is limited, not perfect. Go for it only if your budget is low.Value for money...

Additional feedback: Product returned within a week as both the earbuds not connnecting together and works individually.",3
1374,Total wastage of money,"Not good at all. Writing this review after almost one year. Bought it for 1800 approx but there is a huge latency. Within one year only the charge case does not charge the earpods properly many a times. Buying this at this price is total wastage of money. Also that Mi has drastically decreased their quality of products be it a smartphone or earpods.
Think before you buy it with your hard earned money.",3
1375,"looks and gaming wise.. go for it.. sound quality... not a big fan,!!",for a redmi one.. not that impressive... but ya its an okay one for those who wants to call thru it or play games without much of latency... sound quality is okayish.. noice cancellation is there...not too brilliant... bass quality is light... ni bass boost... look wise its super excellent... dsnt look cheap.. case looks premium.. and looks good in your ears,4
1376,Connectivity issue.,"This is my 2nd day, sound quality is good. 1st day it worked fine, no isuue. But now it has stopped connecting to my Redmi phone. I tried many times, still not able to connect.",1
1377,Really nice product,"I don't think I must write a detailed review because there are lots of reviews on YouTube about the product. But personally, I'm extremely happy with the experience with it. One thing I will say is that the battery backup, for me, was actually way better that advertised. I could get nearly 5 hours at a volume of about 40 percent. For me, personally, the 40% volume was actually enough because when we put on the buds, external noise is nicely reduced, even if it has no active noise cancellation.",3
1378,Very bad experience earlier with redmi earbuds s and now redmi earbuds 2C,"Right airdot of my redmi airbuds 2C goes dim red light when placed in case compared to the bright red light in the left one and does not charge. Been using this airdots in more than a month and its been woking well until the issue suddenly arise. Did not drop the case even once and I am very careful to protect it.

The right airdot is currently empty and wont charge. If anyone could help/guide me fixing this i would greatly appreciate it.",1
1379,Best Earbuds in this range,It is very very good and you should surely go for it even my mom liked it and wanted to take mine it has been 1 month 4 days in exact detail and my experience was the best with It and there is on main con that it does not have any function of changing the tracks from the earbuds itself and you cannot also not change th e volume from the earbud but you can start and stop the song or the video you are watching. Must go for it product,5
1380,Redmi ear pods,Bought couple of days back.....not one but two items ....the red light that is supposed to glow while charging is not working from day one ...can't make out if it's getting charged or not ... battery power not upto the mark...max one hour call ...faulty product both of them...not charging at all.. getting replaced of it works grt or need a refund,1
1381,Stop working after 2 days (after replaced),"Stop working one Earbud after 2 days using and replaced with new one again same problem after 2 days use, i think there is some issue with this product",1
1382,Not recommended for heavy users,Sound quality is Ok. Stop working after 4 days but Amazon exchange with a new product. Thanks to 10 days replacement guarentee. I don't know how much does it goes. Very flimsy product. Case is very small and I feel very difficut to take out this tiny earpod. Noise cancellation is not upto mark.,2
1383,Not great!,Dont expect great audio quality and bass. Its just below average. The only advantage is its true wireless. Low latency mode you shall have disturbances. Pairing isnt always smooth. But battery is good. I feel it will last for a long time. Careful with the plastic as it might break. Audio lag will be there. Go for it to listen to music at the convenance of tru wireless.,3
1384,Best for music lovers 😍,"I've been using this product for the last 2 days and here is my opinion on it.
The battery backup is good. The battery lasts 3-4 hours on regular mode and 2 hours on gaming mode. The build quality is good. The sound is the best under 2k. I've used many earbuds under 2k but this may not have the largest driver but it has the best quality drivers.... well done xiaomi.",5
1385,Received a defective product,"It's not charging from the day I brought it. I am writing it now because I was little away from the day I brought it. I thought on the first day, my charger is not good. Then later I came to know that it's a defect in product.
If possible tell me, I can exchange it or not.",1
1386,Best in range for Music lovers.,"Good product at resonable price. Sound quality is good but not that great, best in this price range. Instant connectivity with mobile via bluetooth, noise cancellation is quite good and the earpods fixes well into ears so as one can easily do workouts and other stuff without fear of falling off from ears.
It was better if it says water-resistant but no mention of this by the manufacturer and disappointed that not able to change tracks while listening music.",4
1387,Good !,"This device deserve 4 stars I believe because the sound quality is not that good the bass is not that great in theae buds , if u like bass than don't go with this one. I have also tried gaming on mobile and laptop both tested games such as pubg mobile clash royale and laptop games such as GTA V and CS GO and Valorant there was a sound delay in all the cases of about 1 or 2 seconds . It's not that bad since its price it's really less. I believe it's good for talking and listening music othervise great product by redmi",4
1388,Very very poor quality. One bud stopped working after 7 days,"Not expected from Mi . Right bud stopped working after using it for only 3 times in 7 days. Unfortunately return window closed one day back.

Pls don't buy by just looking low price which I did. Put some extra amount to enjoy your music.

Mi need to do some serious thinking on this as lot of complaints are of same nature.",1
1389,Should be on your list,"The most comfortable and affordable true wireless earbuds available today. The earbuds themselves are pill shaped and look simple yet tasteful. Impressive sound quality from high end earbuds, light weight and easy to carry with the charging case, earbuds fits in canal with decent noise cancellation, mostly suitable while working in office or even home and not to forget to use it while workout, this all comes under a decent price tag and providing comfortable and clean sound with a combination of good design and useful specifications.",5

The build quality of the product is awesome. Fits your ear like you can’t even feel they are there. Best fit.👍

1392,Sound delay in iPhone,"I purchased it for my iPhone XR but the sound is coming late than the video so it’s useless

Intact when I am typing this review the sound is more than 1 sec late

Sound quality and bass is awesome, even I cannot play PubG with the earbuds due to the late sound",3
1393,Good earbuds,I recieved them today. Overall good earbuds when we consider the price. It also Sounds well. I will check the battery life and update my review.,5
1394,A Review After A Week,"After A Week Of Usage.
Pros:
1.Sound Quality Is Average And The Bass Is Superb In This Price Range.
2.Good Battery Backup.
3.Lighter Feels.After A Hour Of Usage There Is No Feel Of The Earbuds In The Ear.
Cons:
1. The Charge Full Indicator Is Not Working at all.
2 After There Is No Charge In The Charging Case The Phone Is Automatically Connects To The Earbuds Sometimes Even When The Earbud Is In The Case.
3.Sometimes There Is A Lag In Connectivity (Like Audio Drop For A Second Even In A Closer Range)",4
1395,No richness of sound. Stops working. Don't buy,Bass is very bad. Sound quality sucks. It stopped working after 3 days. Had to reset it. Worked. Then again issue came up. Had to return. Verdict- Bad Chinese product not even half it's price's worth.,2
1396,Mediocre sound quality,"I Have returned this product due to bad mediocre sound quality. For this price its not a bad deal but i wanted more and hence decided to go for upper tier.
Bass levels are really low and it starts to become noisy after a certain level.
The design is good as such but its really difficult to take them out of the case without making them fall on the ground.
Go for it if you want something cheap but not if you want good sound quality.",3
1397,Pocket Friendly With Sufficient Features!,I generally take a while before writing a review. It has been ten days since I received the product. In terms of the cost the product is really commendable. Especially the bass and the noise cancellation is very good. I would recommend people to buy this provided they are looking for a product with better quality at a effective cost,5
1398,Ok for the price,"Sound quality : better than what can be expected in this price range.
Noise cancellation : doesn't really perform well outdoors. The call quality is pathetic. Latency is to be expected for earphones in this price range. Go for it only if your maximum budget is less than 2k. The quality is charging case is very much debatable. Poorly designed case.",2
1399,Mediocre,"Was working properly for four months. Then in one ear the volume is significantly reduced, then completely stops working sometimes. I guess this is the general life of these cheap tws Chinese head phones.

Even when it was working sound quality was bad than the generic 500 rupees samsung headphones that are popular in offline market again I think this is expected from all sub 2500 tws ear phone.",2
1400,Must try !! Great product,"OMG ,this earbuds are too good built quality is great so comfortable to wear lightweight, music is awesome balance music bass good mic quality is also good , connect so easily, looks awesome in ears , also good for casual gaming. Great quality in this price range definitely go for it...",5
1401,Not good for calls,"Good for music.
Bad product for attending calls.
Very low voice and not able to hear properly. Noise cancellation is not upto the mark.",2
1402,Budget earbuds. Good quality,Sound quality is good compared to other brands in this budget. Connectivity and usage is nice n simple. Built quality is good. Earbuds actually fits to my ear surprisingly. I wanted battery indicator in this which is not present in this model. Rest everything is good. Happy with the deal.,4
1403,Could have been better with quality,"Sound is ok for the price,
Mic is also fine.. environment noice cancellation not much there.. still able to hear noise around.
Charging case doesn't hold buds strong, fall off.
Can't return. Waste of money.",2
1404,"Good earbuds on the budget, excellent grab in the sale.","The buds are small, and compact. Sound quality is justified for the price, and since I got it in sale, it was a great grab. Though it might be a bit uncomfortable for the people with small ears, its equally good for people with bigger ears since it doesn't hang outside. For bass enthusiasts, It doesn't have extra bass boost (No EQ), but I'm sure that by a little tweaks in EQ, either when using on Phone/Laptop, bass could be configured. Overall and amazing product!",5
1405,Good to go,"Cool deal with the price.
Sound quality- Nice with no so good bass but pleasant
Fit- perfect and doesnt get lose over a time, small and compact
Looks-stylish and plastic quality looks premium
No problem in connection and operation, works as promised.",4
1406,Good product for budget buying,"I thought it was a decent product in terms of sound, comfort, and quality. Offers a good truly wireless experience at a low budget.

1408,Love this earbuds.,"I've been using this product for the last 5days and here is my opinion on it.
Redmi earbuds 2C looks pretty sleek & super stylish, also it is super lightweight at only about 4.1 grams. Easy to carry it around in your pocket or the bag.
It has up to 12 hours of playback time with the case & up to 4 hours of playback time in a single charge.

And i just loved it...",5
1409,Really Good Product in this price segment but Not good for PUBG😊,"The product is really good, music is really punchy, it is handling bass pretty well but if you are planning to buy it for PUBG then you will get noticable latency even though it has low latency mode still noticable latency will obstruct your game play. And I only get 5 eartips (S×1, M×2installed 2×Large)",4
1410,Up to Expectation,"Awesome!!! Worth it.. Good sound quality with perfect bass..
Loved it.. 4hrs of continuously using , Good backup..",5
1411,Affordable True Wireless Earbuds.,Average Product at an Affordable Price . Cant GO wrong with 1799 Rupees you cant get Every feature in such a Small package. but as an Affordable True Wireless Earbud . it is best at its Price. Pretty Happy with the Sound Quality & quite Efficient to Use. Very easy to use with the Actual Press Button on both the Earbud. Great battery Back Up & Good Design .

Found this on Amazon
Sound quality is good not that great,
Battery life is also good
But when it comes to bluetooth range it fails
It's cannot be used via using a hoodie
Or in another room
Or when covered ur ears with hands

Box packaging was good
Got 3 eartips only
Overall experience 40/60",4
1414,Does not charge properly useless,The ear buds don't charge completely even after the specified time as per manual. When the case is opened after charge it keeps flickering from white to red within 10 seconds. I spent the money on an useless thing.,1
1415,Don't go for this..!!!,"Cons:
Connectivity issues. Gets connected even if the dots are in the case. Very bad thing Redmi should work on this or release any firmware upgrade.

Also left and right ear phones don't sync and there's a gap or delay of 1 sec.

Pros.
Light weight, nice sound output in this budget.",3
1416,This is the one I was looking for. 🙂,"I was looking for high quality and budget friendly earbuds since long time. When my friend reccomend me this, I decided to buy this.

But I’m facing one problem, after using 1 hour the sound is not come continuously. It’s breaking. To solve this issue I have to put the AirPods in case every time. Besides this it’s a good product.",4

Awesome sound quality I am very much impressed, built quality is also good.
Cons :-
Buttons are little hard
Buttons quality is average.

In this price range it's best we can't expect more, overall performance is great and I am satisfied.

I played music continuously for 4 hours my ears are not paining it feels comfortable. I loved them very much. If your budget is less then just go for it without any second thought.",5
1421,Value for money,"Pros: 1. Light weight
2. Good battery
3. Good audio quality
4. Call quality is good, the other person at the other end of the call was able to hear me clearly

Cons: 1. Picks up other people voice when on move
2. Audio base is average

Overall it’s value for money as it only cost me 1800.",4
1422,Waste of 💰MONEY,"Don't buy it. If u buy it then for sure u will return it in next 4-5 days. One earbud will stop working after 1-2 days. I replaced it and again it was same ,and this time both of them stopped working any finally I returned it. When I asked my friend he also had the same problem. So don't buy as it is simply wastage of time. Never expected this from redmi.",1
1423,Best TWS Earbuds @ ₹1799/-,"This is one of the most anticipated Redmi product. This Redmi TWS earbud S is one of the best in this price range. The Sound quality and clarity is top notch. Bass is okayish but not bad. Physical buttons are good responsive. I have played PUBG and COD mobile with the new Low latency mode,works like a charm no lags what so ever. Please buy this if your budget is little tight. A must buy for all the PUBG lovers.",5
1424,Really good Hands Free Ear phone,"I pair this with my redmi phone and the earphones are great. I use it to go walking, they do not fall out from the ear.

Drawback: you have to remember t charge it and sometimes the way you remove it from the charging box determines whether or not it switches on.",5
1425,5 Stars just for built quality and durability.,Very Average in terms of sound output and bass. Also keeps on disconnecting on its own sometimes and keeps slipping out of ears but built quality is just great the earphones fell from 2 floor on a marble base and still working fine.,5
1426,After 4 months the left earpiece stopped working,"Poor product comparing to other ear buds at this price point
Average sound quality
No noise cancellation
Poor bass quality
Most important thing is that I've used this product for 4 months and the left earbud speaker stopped working.
Not satisfied with the product",1

3.Price is little Higher as Global price is Around Rs1100 But here Rs1799
4.Charging Cable Is Not added here.
5.Doesnt Work properly On Non-Mi Phones

Overall Good Product and Can Be Bought If Ur budget is That much only.",4
1428,Honest first impressions,"After one day of full use.

Okay, so first impressions - great design, sleep, smooth finish and light.
Sound quality for music is great no doubt. It's a good house cancelling earbud.
It's definitely NOT FOR CALLS, a lot of background noise, metallic voice can be heard and the receiver always complain of disturbance.

Battery life is good, charged for one hour and it's doing its job pretty well.

Earpieces pair with each other seamlessly! Connectivity is amazing.",4
1429,GOOD BUT NOT AS EXPECTED,"Undoubtedly these earbuds are good in sound quality. But if you want bass; don't go for it. Also, I found this product more sophisticated and difficult to handle. Like, it can easily fell down from your ear while moving or while riding bike and then its difficult to find it. Also if the charging case got faulty, then, also these earbuds would be of no use.
In my opinion, these earbuds can't replace earphones. Lookwise also, these buds don't look smart enough in your ears!!",3
1430,Worst Experience,Its been only couple of weeks and one bud stopped charging. Will go to service center or store for warranty. At least don't purchase from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd.,1
1431,Excellent,Product is excellent......but Amazon is delivering products with very slow speed. Prime customers only getting very fast. It's not good. Now a days all e-commerce operators are delivering their products within 48 to 96 hours. But Amazon is taking very long period to deliver their products.....,5
1432,Best airbud to buy with this price,"This is the great product with this price. I am using it since last one week and life is really easy. Specially ease of connecting to laptop for client calls, watching videos or music on laptop with good range of bluetooth connectivity with good battery back up. It also sleept twice on floor and had no damage, so you can see the product built in quality. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
1433,High quality earbuds,"I liked this product because the sound is very crispy.The bass quality is top most.I use this earbuds S for listening music, news, watching movies.This is the best earbud.The charging system is very good.",5
1434,Affordable Product - Value for Money,"The Earbuds from MI comes with affordable price and is having better overall sound quality compare to other earbuds of similar range. The main reason for giving three stars are two drawbacks in earbuds.
1. The voice quality in audio calling is not upto the mark. However voice quality in video calling is somehow good.
2. When connected with TV (say MI TV), there is a time lag in audio output.

Other than above two drawbacks, the product is a value for money.",3
1435,Best one to buy,It's really awesome and loved it. Good pair of earbuds good bass at the low volume sound clarity is good and want to tell this point long life of usefullness 5hrs of continuous playback of full charging battery capacity is good too I have used all other products but redmi is so pretty it's good to use I loved most best airdopes I loved to listen music with this call quality is too good I have ordered 3days before but Too fast delivery by Amazon Hatsoff for my music journey will be good with this product,5
1436,I received a defective product..,"I received a defective product. the product is not what I thought, It's really a cheap brand. I wish I would have bought different bran instead of buying this one. I wanted to return this and get my money back but unfortunately, But I do not see any update on my return/canceled order from amazon. Looks like amazon is really not bothered what their customer is receiving and what their feedback.",1
1437,Great at price point,Fits perfectly in ear. Good design. Sound quality is good if price is considered. Battery backup is great. Now I don't use it whole day. Use twice a day for 3-4 hours and have to charge twice or thrice a week. Mic is good but not in too noisy environment.,4
1438,Good product,Have used for 3 days. It has no latency while playing games the buds i used before had latency so where not useful for gaming. Still there is only 0.1 sec latency in this as well but ok it can be used for gaming. Over all sound quality and all is good.,5
1439,Nice one,When I first opened the package right side earphone didn't connect but when powered it on individually then it connected itself. these have some connecting issues.Overall for RS 1299 you can't except anything great just nice one,5
1440,Pleasantly Surprised,"When we compare with other earbuds..
1. Very handy
2. 12 hours of battery backup
3. Box design
4. 2 sets of extra buds
5. Good bass quality
6. Splash proof
The main advantage is power off and on button on the front side of the earbuds. Usually we will have a fingertouch for other buds. So giving button on that place is the most perfect I can say
And also it is normal USB pin charger and no specific pin is not required to charge it.",5
1441,Value for money I guess!!,"I liked this product. It is a good option for below 2K mark. Sound quality is fine/good. Built quality is good. Noise cancellation works fine. It's bass quality is good enough for this range of earbud.
Overall, it is a good product.",4
1442,Good enough,"Have been using it for 3 days now. Sound quality pretty good. Have faced few bugs with Bluetooth connection, but easily resolved by unpairing & pairing again.
Good battery life.
Call quality is not so great, specially for the person on the other side.
Don't expect similar performance as a Jabra, Sony or Bose but overall pretty decent buy for its price range.",3
1443,"Pretty looking, Average sound...","Well i have been waiting for my 1st tws which i can afford...mi tws is good for looking,,it is vert much small,cute looking,,
Connectivity is really smooth and simple
Fitting in ears is no pblm,,very light weight
In term of sound exactly sounded like any 400/- wired earphone..dont expect anything from music experience,, mushy sound everytime..
Just buy it for as a 1st tws buyer dont expect more.",3
1444,Great product,"Received it today, one word it's amazing, unprecedented for this price
Build quality, and audio both are excellent.
I used in the gym, didn't feel any discomfort.",5
1445,Aweful product,"I ordered it once and the left ear piece stopped working the same day. I guessed it was just by chance so I ordered it again and this time it worked properly for more than a week and this time right ear piece has gone dead. I am very disappointed.
On 14 November the left earbud stopped working too, which is exactly after 1 month.",1
1446,Good Product,"Working fine. Smooth connectivity. Easily fitting in ears and not heavy. Charges fast
Voice quality - good bass ok mid range and ok trebel. People can hear me on call while on earbuds however during using clubhouse people could not head me properly somehow. In this price quality this is v good wire free messy ear ph buy. ॐ",5
1447,Brilliant product,Amazing product in amazing price. I am very happy with the audio quality of this ear buds. The desing is also very good and it fits well in the ears. Good playback time. Overall very amazing product. It offers a very good bass. Battery back up is definitely good with strong build quality.,5
1448,5 star====Only for Latency!!! Else depend upon the listener..,"Every thing is good,except the music quality..i don't know why from the very first (since they launched the earphones segment in india) i didn't liked the music quality from the xiaomi sound technology.they broke the barriers in terms of revolutionary technologies but except the sound part of the earphones.. yes,it depends upon the person to person listening behavior,but as a music lover this was my experience..",5
1449,Average Headphones with good battery backup,"Battery Backup is good easily gives more than 3.5 hrs of bacup.Sound Quality is poor,bass is average, treble is low, instrument separation is very bad only the vocals are clear.Good for watching movies.I tried playing pubg and it was okayish(playable).Case quality is average,case looks good and portable.Mic quality is good actually if you take calls in your home or in a silent place or else the noise cancellation is not that much to allow you to calls in traffic related areas.",3
1450,"OK, nothing great.","I don't expect much at this price. Plastic feel, not very premium. Average build quality. So, these are ok for casual use, some music or video or calls. Certainly feels very short lag while watching YouTube, not deal breaking. Buy this only if, budget is your prime concern.",3
1451,Does the job but could be better,"the device is of good build quality and charging case fits nicely in pocket to travel around.

Pro:
Good battery life
Fits nicely in ear
easy setup with all devices checked so far

Cons:
The sound jarrs a bit if phone and buds are more than 5 feet away
bass is ok, treble is off in most audio. high gain songs dont sound right
During voice calls, other side can hear noise and a lot of echo",3
1452,Damaged not working the right ear bud,"Right ear bud was working fine till last 2 days, but after that it is not able on only.... Only one ear bud is working...when I put in the battary case only left one is charging and not the right ear bud, I am strongly disappointed for this product and want replace the stuff, but replacement date is closed.... This is 2nd time happened for the same time.... I strongly want to change this stuff.... Kindly reqeast Amazon to provide us the quality stuff as soon as for our money worth.....",1
1453,Worst product. Buy only if you dont want to use this,"Had bought this buds in may 2020.after 7 months its charging case no longer holds the charge. I can not charge earphone without connecting case to the charger. Worst case for earbuds as When I put one bud to case other one constantly beeping because it continuesly connecting and disconnecting.
My review : dont buy this as you will regret a lot after guarrenty period is over. I cant use this because of the case problem",1
1454,Great Product with this price range,"Absolutely nice product with this price range,using it from last 5 days. nice sound quality, great battery life ,built quality good, you can use it to your mobile/PC .Can use left ear bud one mobile and right one to another mobile",5
1455,Good one,"Ta first I was scared to buy and try a new product but after using it I m very much satisfied with it
Sound quality is amazing
I thought they might fell off my ears but thy don't :P
Liked it🤗

One star is less coz you should provide charging cable with it which is not there in the box",4
1456,"Worse product, Try something else. DONT FALL FOR THIS PRICE.","If you're looking for something which can be used for only calling puproses then it's fine.
Not suitable for Running, Jog, Workout.
Bass- Zero or Minus 10.
Sound & Sound Quality- 1.
Charging- Good.
Appeal- Good.
*DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU'LL REGRET*
Don't fall for this price. Branded by Redmi but worse.",1
1457,Loud & Clear....,"It's a good one...clear sound & clarity is wonderful...battery stays for a good amount of time (even days)

Except the part where it fits the whole ear so talking with this in ears creates an echo effect...phone calls also will be at its best because of the whole cover..",5
1458,Bad Voice Calls experience,"During the call connectivity drops, neither I am able to hear nor the person on other side. Recurring issue happens everytime. And after call it doesn't comnects to music. Have to switch off and on to reconnect.

Disappointed with the product. Have Ordered replacement, let's see how that one turns out.",2
1459,Below average,"I am writing this review after 5 months of usage. There may problems
1. There is a problem with bluetooth connection between the 2 ear buds.
2. The earbud s can't be used outdoor for calling due to high noise issues.
3. The charging case broke due to heat at the time of charging.
4. Charge backup is not as said by the company.
5. Having issues sometimes at WhatsApp group calling.",1
1460,Low Budget decent earbuds,The ear buds have a smooth finish... They feel very light weight and I have zero issues with the fit and comfort... The earbuds doesn't fall off while you are running or jumping... The sound is decent considering the price... The battery life is 3.5 hours and a total of 10 to 11 hours with the case... So if you are looking for a truly wireless earphones at a very low budget then go for it...,5
1461,Great product for just ₹1800,"Received the product within a day with prime. Just like I expected except the size of the case, which is smaller (it's a good thing though). Bass is good and overall quality of the sounds,loudness everything is good too (as per the price). I easily get about 4 hours with full charge on the earbuds. Gaming is awesome as well, I didn't feel the need to enable gaming mode on the earbuds for low latency. Glad that this product is available for just ₹1800. Happy with the buy.",5
1462,Good product at this price range,Great product at this price tag. Sound quality is good for music as well as for calls. Battery life is ok not so good. It will last only for 3 hrs and it takes 30 mins again to charge the device 100%. Pairing with device is very easy. Google assistant works seamlessly with the device which makes calling function a great experience. Its ultra light however built quality is not so premium.,5
1463,Best In The Price Range,"Review After Usage For A Day

Don't Go By The Fake Reviews,

At this price point this is best you can get

3. Worst Sound no bass.
4. Connectivity issues.
5. It's not a earbuds it's just a headache.",1
1467,Amazing sound quality,"The sound quality here is 9/10, and brass 10/10. This is easy to use and gets connected easily. This has a button on the top which helps to pause, receive or reject a call etc. Bass quality is really good and sound cancellation is effective. The price range is quite good and affordable. Value for money this is.
Overall this is 8.5/10 to use. Go for it.",5
1468,Good at 999 or else go for other,"I got it for 999 on offer sale
To be honest at this price it is a good one .
Decent bass as expected and it is good for calling
Note that at this price you can't expect high quality
And sound quality is also good.
Also battery is good 12 hrs.
Overall good and I don't got any connectivity issue
If you get it for 999 it is best and if your budget is higher than 1000 go for others.",4
1469,Quality is not upto the mark,"Quality is not upto the mark..
-Call quality is really bad
-Connectivity between both earbud is pathetic
-Case has loose connection with buds it get connected even after buds are placed inside the case and case is closed.

I have returned it.",2
1470,DOES JUSTICE FOR PRICE PAID,"The product does justice for money paid, say value for money, very good for receiving calls sounds are very clear, played A R REHMAN songs, have activated auto call receive hence no need to press the button repeatedly",5
1471,Horrible product,"Horrible item. Please don't buy. I paid 1600 for this and now I am repenting.
The left earpiece is not working right after 7 days of product delivery and now I cant even return also.
Please don't wate your money.",2
1472,Don't buy if you want to enjoy music on this,It has the worst possible sound. Audio gets distorted heavily which is noticable in songs. Tested across various streaming services. Connection is good and steady with 2-3% drops.,2
1473,Best product!! And worth for money,"I have unboxed it, And everybody asks me in comments that is it best or not? But it is best even bose user can tell it is best, But when you check 1-star reviews They tell only physical defects, But physical defects and Genuine, Honest Review.

Hope you buy it:)
Have a nice day:)",5
1474,Stuck in a one way street,Extremely poor mic. The other party just cannot hear clearly. Hence cannot use in work related matters. Tried all positions in wearing it so mic coulx work better. No go! HUGELY disappointed,2
1475,Using everyday and they work great,"These work good for me. The earbuds are comfortable and provide noice cancellation. You need to turn any one on and they get connected to the phone. The charged buds work for a good duration. I feel these work good for everyday purpose for office meetings, etc.",5
1476,Compact and durable,"The feature I look for earbuds nowdays is that they shouldn't fall of the ear, and this one is perfect for that , they stay in place while running or exercising , have great battery backup , top notch surround sound as well",4
1477,Average product,Budget buy so sound quality is comparatively better than any other tws in this range. Calling quality is not so good the other side will not hear your voice clearly. There are connectivity isaues with both the buds. At times they won't connect with each other and at times they won't connect with your device. It's a little headache. But overall nice product. Not soo good not soo bad. Average.,3
1478,Wonderful,"Its a must buy product with very good bass
Its very lightweight and its noise cancellation works nice .If you hear music on full volume then also nobody can hear which song you are listening",5
1479,I will suggested you to buy this erabuds at this value is amazing. And I am using it with MI phone.,"What they don't have( issue)
-Deep base
-No Charging indicator in case unable to know the remaining battery in case or duration to full
charge the case.

What they have (quality)
- fast connection
- better sound quality
- light weight
- value of money
- low latency mode almost good.

Note - I will suggested you to buy this erabuds at this value is amazing. And I am using it with my redmi phone.",4
1480,Not expected such bad quality product from Redmi...,Not good for voice calling. Has echo problem along with interface sound while talking to people .Tried both in Redmi 6 pro and Iphone 6s . Battery full charged and far end people will feel sound coming from very far from this ear bud .While listen. to music sound will break sometimes to to bluetooth connectivity issue .,2
1481,Best affordable earbuds under 1500. Go for it!,I have purchased 2 quantity of this earbuds recently. Very satisfied with the purchase. Worth the price tag. I feel this is one of the best affordable earbuds under 1500 INR. Go for it.,5
1482,Great quality earbuds,Sound quality is amazing. Noise cancellation working properly. It gives perfect bass with different types of songs. The best thing that i liked about this that it gives a good play time. Really happy with these earbuds.,5
1483,Really Bad Connectivity....,"It has Connectivity issue...tat its disconnecting for 1 or 2 sec & then suddenly it gets back to normal again..
Facing this issue When it is connected in Mobile , PC & Laptop too ...
So Think Twice before buying it...",1
1484,Except bass everything else is too good,Everything is too good except the base. I used these for a day and the sound quality is too good clear and loud enough. Noise cancellation is also good and the battery is as said with minute difference. But if you are a bass lover dont go for it. Call quality is not bad we can hear good but the microphone is average which which makes the opp person unable to hear is unless we talk loud.,4
1485,Calling issues are there and for music its best,During the call my voice is not properly audible to the caller.and the range is also very less. Maximum 7 to 10 m is the range i am getting. Sound quality is good. It fits on thhe ear veryy nicely and smoothly. Only thhe problem is during calling. If you are buying it for regular calling pls dont buy it. Go for some other brands. Or if u r buying just for music u can buy buy it blindly.,4
1486,Waste of money.,"Received in good condition and promptly delivered on 11th Oct 2020. Left ear bud become dead on 24th Oct 2020 within 2 weeks despite very little and cautious use.
Sound cancellation is good but sound quality not good. I do not recommend this product.
I wasted my money on it.",1
1487,Truely amazing,"The product build is compact and easy to carry in pocket, sound is good as per the price segment.
The sound is awesome and pleasant fitting is easy and as expected. are also waterproof which is an addon to the feature .I loved the product and bass, it includes a manual a usb cable and 3 pairs of eartips.
Battery backup is too nice it lasted for 9hours for me on single charge.
Decent buy in the budget.",5
1488,Worst earphones I ever used,"DO NOT BUY
The right earphone stopped working just after 20 days.
I can not return it either now.
Now when I am putting right earphone in the charging case it is getting so overheated that I fear it will just burst.
I could smell the burning smell from the charging case.",1
1489,Noice sound while speaking voice call,"Used after 1 week I leave my feedback.

It's okay for music. But don't buy this if you want to use this as a voice call speaking purpose. So noice. Others it's good product for the price.",3
1490,Go for it only if you are in a budget.,"I have been using these for a week now.
pros:
cheap and worth the price,
number of charges offered by the box is really good

cons:
very low quality of earbuds(irritation in the ear).
connectivity issues sometimes
disturbance sometimes while in a call(other person cant hear properly)

i would recommend boat instead.",3
1491,Bad Quality,"While the sound quality has been good, but the product is highly un-durable. First time I got a defective piece, with only one ear bud functioning. Replacement I received worked well for a month, then all of sudden Left ear bud stopped working. Since it is already past replacement period, don't have any choice left but to order a new one.😰😰😰",1
1492,Both buds stopped working on Day 2,"The left earbud stopped working on day 1, so, I ordered a replacement and was using only the right earbud but it stopped working on day 2. I did not expect such a low quality product from Xiaomi. I'm gonna return them if the next pair also has problems. I never thought I'd say this about a Xiaomi product but be cautious about buying it.",1
1493,Budget Ka baap 😌🤪🤪,"First of all I'm so excited to get this tws range earbuds in this price
Coming to the point
* Overall build quality is good enough at this
price range
* Sound is not best just good and nothing will get in this price
* Noice cancellation is quite good.
* 🔋 Life not bad as mentioned it's not worth of 4hrs hardly we'll get 3 hrs to 3 :1/2 hrs not bad
* At last it nearly takes 3 secs to pair nice product just loved it ❤️💞🤪",5
1494,One of the earbud stopped working after 14 days,After 14 days of usage one of the earpod is not working. And unable to return the item. So went to redmi service center and they told me the item will be replaced with new one. But its been 15 days. Didnt get the product,1
1495,For music and gaming perfect choice,"Sound quality is perfect
Fit to ear is perfect
Build quality average
Noice cancellation pathetic (it absorbs the outside noice very clearly. It's really annoying)
The button is too tight to operate.it causes pain and the ear bud may go into the ear further (air tight) causing air pressure which may affect tympanum badly.
Lack of sensor causes the music not stop when taken from ears.",3
1496,Fully Waist for Game But Amazing For MUSIC AND CALL,"It was a amazing product for music move options but it was very bad for gaming use .the low frequency features did not help to reduce the sound latency. While playing pubg take 3 or 4 seconds to reach to ear
. Its a waist product for gamers
. But its sound quantity is amazing very best bass quality
I realy low for calling and hearing music
You can choose this for music and calling because its word less",3
1497,Avoid! Failure rate is high.,"Bought this based on reviews! Stopped working after 40 days, waste of money, can't return!

While it was working, I didn't find it good in terms of connectivity experience.

Go for moonwalk, half the price, and super smooth to connect.",1
1498,Worth it!!!,Earbuds are nice in its price range. Keeping charge around 5 hours without case in one go. Sound quality is also good. Bluetooth connectivity is average. But for its price its more than enough. MI is good brand also. Kept its brand value.,4
1499,quality earbuds just for 1799! unbelievable!,i was looking for affordable branded earbuds for long because for me 3999 wasn't worthy just for the pair of earbuds.. thanxx to Facebook where i got to know about redmi earbuds.. u can't expect better in this price range.. even appreciated by my younger brother who is using Apple airpods,5
1500,No sound delay with good battery life.,I am very impressed with the sound quality and battery life. Also look of this Earbuds is very decent and good looking. I am using boat Earbuds and now I ordered there earbud comparatively these Earbuds is better than boat Earbuds. I was facing sound delay in boat Earbuds and in these Earbuds no sound delay no any other problems.,5
1501,Quality issues,"Bad product overall.
It has only 6 months of warranty and there are quality issues.
For me earbud's battery stopped holding charge twice.
Once left earbud's battery stopped working in only 4 months of usage but it was under warranty so I got it replaced.
Then after 9 months case's battery stopped working and then they were completely useless.
Just go for something else.",2
1502,Stopped working after 4 days of use,"I have received this item last week and after 4 days of use, its right earbud got stopped working.
bass and sound quality from these earbuds are decent but they would have concentrated on the quality of this product more.
I recommend not to go for this because if something is not durable enough what is the point of buying it.
Thanks",1
1503,Yet another Value for Money product by Xiaomi,Only credible and branded wireless earbuds available under 2k. Have been waiting for this product since it was launched in China. Sound is amazing (did not expect such sound in a low value product). Fit in the ear is great and they are small and very compact. Connectivity is seamless. No 'jhanjhat' of connecting every time you get a call. Battery life could have been better but cannot complain at this price.,5
1504,Overall not recommended as a music device,"Only cons no pros...1st time left bud wasn't working... replaced it..next time right bud stopped working after 30mns of usage.
Coming to music quality...it can be labelled decent..music tune sometimes sounds odd..maybe due to low quality bluetooth..bass not that good",2
1505,It does the job,"The right earbud is making a rumbling noise sometimes . Not expected from a new product.
But The battery life is good. Sound is good for hearing vocals but I feel like the music quality could have been better..",2
1506,Kinda Dissapointed,"Pros:
-Connects to my laptop in a snap
-good sound quality
-Noise cancelleation Above average
Cons:
-Doesnt always connects in the first try
-Sound Glitches and breaks
-Sometimes Pisses me out

Overall, I would suggest you to buy another earphone if you dont have patience",2
1507,Very good product,"These earbuds are good in look but the fit is little loose in my ears. Battery life is around 1.5 days of full charge. Weight is very light around 4g . This is very handy and portable and easy to charge with my powerbank also. Its price is very affordable i bought this form amazon in 1749 its MRP is 1799 , 50 rupees discount are provided it is a great deal.",5
1508,Good quality in this price,I bought it almost 1 month back. Its working good for me till now. The bass and sound quality is good. It fits perfectly in ear. Bluetooth connection is also works fine for me.,4
1509,Budget ear buds,"It suits week to iPhone and product is good. However, charging cable is not available with this item and to be sourced separately. Noise level and reach is good. Can be a budget ear bud",4
1510,Want more,"Sound quality is passable.
Stuff I wish it had- battery indicator, disconnect on putting in the case even when case isn't charged. I've woken up to find the buds out of charge in the morning. A better cap- flip is satisfying but the material is cheap. I can see it breaking off in a month

The description for all redmi products goes the same. Not top notch but awesome for the price",3
1511,Good go for it,Earphone are good mine battery last for more than 12 hours can with case and go for continue play of more than 3.5 hours but there one problem when case battery got drained and earphone is just lying they get turn on and automatically connect with phone...while still lying in the case they get turn on,4
1512,Worst low latency,"Low latency my foot.
After 2 shot you can hear firing ,you wont even understand from where you are being shot at .cannot hear enemy foot step in time all you ll see is you are getting damage but no gunshots could be heard",3
1513,best in this price range,"I have been using it for a week now. very good earphones. Battery backup is promising. even the microphone is pretty decent. the buds come in 3 sizes (Small, Medium & Large). All the three sizes are included in the box. its very hard to activate the assistant through the buttons. The buttons are the reason I am not giving it 5 stars.",4
1514,Never Buy from this seller-No replacement from seller-Pathetic backend service by Amazon,"Replacement requested but seller cheated and amazon picked the defective item after 5 days of pick up request

Product is defective because of over heating",1
1515,worst product..,"from xaiomi waow i thought it is good product..
aft one hr of use got stop working..
now i found it is very bad law quality earbuds 2 c. i never expect from xaiomi can provide such inferior quality product.
friends dont waste time & money buying it..
replacement order has bin done..
i will b back..
aft replacemet same problame.... using 7/8 days",1
1516,Buds not charging in case,It's been just 5 days since I'm using the product and the case is already showing issues. The buds should get disconnected and start charging in case but it does not disconnect and stay connected. If any device is not available to connect it keeps searching for devices and end up exhausting the buds battry when they are in charging case. Redmi should look into this problem. Requested for replacement hope the new product works well.,2
1517,Small size loud noise and good battery.,One absolute thing you will love about it is it's size. So small not only earbuds but also the box. The most important thing in wirless earbuds is it battery life and they easily last 3.5 hours and can be charged 3-4 times in the case. And sound is pretty good no complaints.,5
1518,Good but fragile product.,"Overall good product. Used it for about a day. When I bought it from here, it was defective piece. So I had to go to mi store to replace it. And then after that it works fine. It has 6 months of replacement guarantee. So that's good. Sound quality is decent and it fits ear perfectly. Range is about 1 room or 4-5 meter. And battery backup is decent. It's passive noice cancellation is not best but not at the bottom either.",3
1519,Waste of money,"Cheap build quality, Equally cheap fitting and soumd quality, Dont waste money go buy with more money and better sound quality. I have used JBL/ Beats/ Sennheiser audio i can clearly tell it had worst of sound.",3
1520,Best in the price range,"Perfect sound for base lovers. Also highs and lows are well balanced.

Call quality is way better than other ear phones of this price range. Microphone quality is best for this price.

Used it for some time now but still not found any issues with battery performance. It gives about 3hr playback on mid volume and about 2hr with high volume

Overall a good buy for this price range. With the trust of redmi !!!",5
1521,Superb quality earpods,"Extremely light weight and superb quality ear buds. Good noice cancellation, clear voice, easily connectible to any devices. Sturdy quality and fita easily in ear. Can also use a single earpod.",5
1522,"Very satisfied with product, sound quality is awesome.","I am very happy with redmi earbuds, I bought different earbuds, i even bought boat 381 but did not get satisfication with sound quality I bought redmi earbuds and I am very happy with sound quality, will always recommend everyone to buy redmi earbuds.",5
1523,Average sound quality with no depth and clarity,Buy this product only for its handsfree capability. The sound clarity is below average and bass quality is not so good and reverberating. Sounds like a local earphone in terms of music. Better go for the oppo enco m31 or oneplus bulllets in this price range,3
1524,Worst product,Worst product I have ever buy I have changed this 2 times from mi service center but getting the same problem right bud stop working after 2-3 hours very disappointed by mi .don't buy it .it's a wastage of money 😠😠,1
1525,Connectivity issues during call (Break sound during the call),"Writing this review after 5 months of user experience.

It works fine while watching video or listen to music. But it does not work well after few months on call. You will face connectivity issues (sound will break) during the call even in the full range of network area. In the same call if you disconnect buds and try to switch over phone sound, you will not see any issues.",3
1526,"Very very Poor battery, decent built quality, decent purchase","Pro: built quality, light, range.
Cons: battery is the worst! Hardly able to hold charge for 2 hours, not made for music or audiophile, decent for meetings and calls.

I am unable to use it as the battery is really poor and I need it constantly for my constant officially meetings and calls. It's ok if some ppl are ok with sub-par music quality.
Overall a decent purchase.",3
1527,Quality is not good as it looks..Would not recommend,"Call quality: very average.

The button control: It is too big that when I adjust it while in a call, the button gets pressed and the call gets disconnected.. touch control or a smaller button would have been better.

Connectivity: Not good. Sometimes both the buds are out of sync.

Had to return it in a day since left earbud stopped working/ had loose contact in the charging case.

Earbuss in this price range is probably not a good option.",3
1528,Auto-tunes itself.,Bad choice for music lovers and ok ish for for calling. it has glitches and needs to be restart every 4/10 times. glitches include loss of sound after a regular interval of 2 secs and auto tuning. It is really annoying when it autotunes ur fav song. Go for it if u want a compact goodlooking TWS earphone for gaming or calling or listening to podcasts.Fit is good and the best part is that its very small,2
1529,Don't buy...,"Please think twice before buying this item. It has very high latency. Poor battery backup not lasting more then 3 hours.

1532,I am not happy with the redmi earbuds.,"I have received this item and it was not working properly.
After that I got replaced item and again after 7 days I found that one side of Earbuds is not working.

1538,"Worst mic ,otherwise good",It's overall a good earbuds at this price except the mic it's not at all good. I don't know if I need to change some settings (which I didn't able to find yet). when you are on a call the other person can hear everything in background except your voice over this earbuds.,3
1539,Worth what you are paying for...,"According to the price...the sound quality is just really awesome... because I am not a great fan of tws as most of them offer really bad sound quality...but I was surprised when I used this...

Now please don't expect bass like that of sony or good wired earphones...by the price at which they come and the quality that they offer is simply amazing...",4

1542,Must use products for MI users or any other android user,"they are the best till date i've used any bluetooth earbuds. sound is really loud and good. different sizes of earbuds are given according to ear size that's really amazing, ears don't pain. battery quality is also amazing it can work approx 6hrs. which is way better than other wireless earuds. i recommend to try this.",5
1543,Defective item received,Received defective item. Asked for replacement well within time. Amazon ignored considering the replacement. There is no guarantee on the products purchased through Amazon. But unfortunately I have to use the Amazon gift cards only through them,1

1545,Best for music but below par for call support,"Redmi products usually they are better but this product is great for people who are only need music listening it has good sound clarity and bass, but call support is really not upto the mark after a couple of mins of call one side doesn't get heared and the other part is it attracts lot of outside noise and makes irritation to the other end person.",3
1546,Ok product,"Ok product not to good not bad... it's not good for people who use for calling...

1552,"Seems to be a great product, but i guess i received a faulty piece","issues:
- randomly disconnects
- loose connection on the charging station
- does not always give battery back-up promised on the box (even at stable volume

pros:
- Compact
- Cheap
- good battery back-up on the box, so am guessing a good unit should work fine
- instant connectivity
-light weight",3
1553,Good to be used by user who has minimal use of headphone in daily routine.,"Some apps does not support proper video buffering, observed issue while watching videos on cult and Amazon app
Also, the buds gets disconnect automatically

No break in connectivity ....good mic ...i ve no problem and neither does the other side person complain about my voice quality .. battery about 2.5 hour to 3 hour on about 70 percent volume .

1560,Overall it's good,"For this price range, it's definitely a good product. The shape n size and they way it fits everything is good. Sound quality is good. The only drawback I saw was a fraction of second communication delay while playing online games, which really matters a lot to a gamer.",4

5. bass is close to ZERO",1
1565,Low quality,"Can’t use on WhatsApp video call, in normal calls if there is slight notice near you the other person on other end of phone will not be able to hear your voice... S/he will hear only noice... you can use it only for listening to some songs and watching movies etc..",2
1566,Value for money.,"Guys! I must says these are worth a single penny we are spending. Battery backup is awesome as compared to other devices of same category, build quality is good it does not look cheap material and last one is sound. Though you cannot compare it with airpods and other high end earphone. This os worth buying.",4
1567,Decent product,Good product for the price but battery backup is less. Also very delicate earbuds. Hard to catch the with two fingers and take them out of the box. overall a decent product for the price range offered by redmi,3
1568,Good,"This product is good, average. As i am using it for almost a year now and now at present the battery life went low and there is always background noise while talking over the call. The caller always complains about the background noise which is louder than my voice. Other than that all is good.",4
1569,Shouldnt have bought,"Bluetooth connectivity is pathetic and cannot have conversations via these buds.
Fine for one way music / video watching.
But connectivity with TV sets pretty pathetic.",2
1570,Good quality earbuds,"Earbuds are of good quality, good sound, nice battery backup and light weight. It connects to bluetooth quicly. It fits well without any problem of shaking. Timely delivered by amazon within 1 day.",5
1571,Not for long run,"Left ear bid stopped working in immediate after return period .

Don't know how to proceed now.

First time ever I am experiencing this kind of quality issues from Mi product.

When it comes sound quality satisfied looking at the price point.

But quality should have been better",1
1572,Overall good but hate the button,"Overall build quality is good. Sound is excellent considering the price. One thing I dont llike is button, every time you press button earbud tip go deep in your ear canal. At this time they should provide touch controls. And missing the usb-c.",4
1573,Best Crap one can buy... Beware,"Beware of this inferior quality product. I am a big MI fan but lately their products have dropped QC and as they are growing the customer service has diminished.
Multiple problem with the product.to simplify the review... Just do not buy it.",1
1574,Worst buy,"I brought this with lot of expectations. But after using this I m highly disappointed. It's far worse than non branded ear buds.
Very bad connectivity
Non user friendly
Issues with charging of ear buds in the case
Total waste of money",1
1575,Don't buy,🤬🤬🤬 wastest product.If u buy ur wasting it . I bought it and gave it return within 5 Hours.One of the worst case.Battery drained with in seconds. Sad,2
1576,Very low battery backup,"I am using this product before 1 year this is Really bad product of xiaomi..
This is very low battery back up device..
After 2:40hrs to 3 hours this device will stop",5
1577,The earbuds are great overall,"They fit in perfectly after I changed the earbud on it to a smaller size. Not bulky or huge like other earbuds in the same price range.

Sound quality is good but the highlight is the noise cancelling feature. There isnt any noticable delay when playing music or watching videos.

The case is super light, which is great but at the same time you have to be careful when you handle it.",4
1578,Good for 1 day,"Day 1 worked fine
Day 2 completely lost
Audio started coming from either 1 automatically and stops in between
Terrible quality
Won't recommend",1
1579,"For very basic use only , not for audiophiles, but for just phone calls and all this is oky","Sound quality is just average, volume is low.
But for the price i don't know any other earbuds do better. Connection and quality is fine...not impressive but again for the price this could be the best. 1200",3
1580,Microphone quality it’s too tooo poor,"Microphone quality is too poor I mean to poor and sound quality not justify price , if you want call quality you definitely disappointed and frustrated
In China its available on 1000 rs",1
1581,Worth buying! (not for calls though),"Great quality.. I like the sound profile too (more focused towards vocals)
Steal for your bucks... Must go for it..
Also, you can alter the sound signature by downloading an equilizer from playstore.... And it makes it even better!
Only cons. - cant take calls with these",5
1582,Best for the price!,"The bass is good but not great. Connectivity takes around 5 seconds when you remove it from the case, so this could be improved. The range is good enough roughly around 50-70m.
Just one main issue which I faced was we can't increase or decrease volume or change music from the buds.
Overall product is good for its price range compared to other products.",4
1583,Charging port not working in 40 days of usage,I bought it 40 days ago and now it's charging port is not working. I never expected this with an expensive earbuds specially from redmi products. Now I hate it,1

1587,Good at this price,Really nice product..... Gd👍battery backup....sound quality is also gd..... Bt i think noise cancelling should be better.... If u r in silence place then no problem bt if u make a little noise that can be hear on other side ..... My main problm is it doesn't fit into my ears so i can't carry it outside. . ... Otherwise it is a gd product.,4
1588,Does the job - VFM,"Initial review ..First point ,does not quite sit in the ear as easily, does tend to slip out a bit ..but this might just be me !!
Charger not provided , should have been there !!
Audio quality is fair. Pairs quite easily and does the job, mic is fairly decent as well ! VFM at its price point.",4
1589,Value for Money,"Mi staying true to its mantra of providing good product within budget which most of us can afford has created these TW earphones.
The sound quality is decent.
Bass and treble is decent.
Noise cancellation is something that we can't really get in this price .
Fit is quite good and they don't fall even while doing light exercises.
I have been using them for attending my daily calls and they perform quite good.",5
1590,Not for music lovers,I don't know if I got a defective item. The sound starts to crackle at high volumes. There is a humm when vocals hit. I find the price to be expensive for some cheap built earphones. Mi products have a good repo but i find this product to be rather poorly built. In china these cost around 1000 here its 1800 but quality (Audio) is not upto mark.,1
1591,Good for inhouse only,Voice is goid but it keeps falling from the ears frequently. Can be used in home only if you go out and ride or drive please don't buy this product.,3
1592,Value for money,"Perfectly snugs on the ears.. if you are looking for running or workouts, then your search ends here. Battery can’t comment as it’s too new. But for the price it is worth every penny.",5
1593,For the price a good purchase.,Battery of both earphone and case when combined will give you enough backup for the whole day. Even for hevy users. Earphones alone when fully charged will hold for least 2.5 to 3 hours.. Only downside is the physical key. Other than that it's almist perfect. Bass is good. Volume is powerful. Fitting to my ear is also good. For me atleast.,4
1594,Poor quality.Not working after 6 months.,"One of the earbuds has stopped working after 6 months.

You can't see the battery level of the charging case. There is no option, that's you can understand if you has turn on gaming mode.

1600,Wonderful earbuds,The earphones are just amazing.The sound and the bass quality is wonderful and the earbuds fit just perfectly in your ears and are very comfortable.

1630,Good product but doesn't fit into the Ears properly.,"The product is good with sound and bass quality. However, tried in different ways to properly fit into the ears, but everytime it falls.",3
1631,"Fraud, stopped working in just 6 months,","Its fraud, stopped working after just 6 months, just after the 6 months warranty,
1700 rupees wasted.
Go with another brand with same prise and having warranty of 1 year atleast.
Those are non repairable also, mi customer care told me, seriously frustrated.",2
1632,Earbud stop working and case is magical,"right side earbud isn't working and there is only replacement options available...

I received my replaced earbuds today
there something new I found

music is still on after I kept both the buds in case (closed). you can listen music in closed case as well..",1
1633,Good,Good...been using for over a year. No issues...sound is good too. Only problem is it gets discharge in 2 hours but no problem at this price.,5
1634,Worst,"D- grade earbuds, very weak design and built up quality, if it gets fall it'll stop working for sure",1
1635,Best budget earphone,"The product is one of the best in this range the sound quality is good this earphone even has voice assistants feature too
SO IN ONE LINE

Best budget earphone in this price",5
1636,Build quality and durability is really bad.,The left earbuds suddenly stopped working after two months. Not worth buying. At this price one does not expect the sound quality to be good. But what one expects is for the product to last for sometime. You don’t get either from these pair of earbuds.,1
1637,Worth for its price range !!,"Pros
Reasonable sound for its price
Good clarity and good noise cancelation
Comfortable and perfect fit

Cons
Battery standby time slightly lesser
Not recommended for a bass lover",3
1638,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY !! DO NOT BUY!!,"INTIALLY IT WAS WORKING , BUT DAY AFTER I GOT IT, IT'S RIGHT BUD NOISE HAS BECOME QUITER THAN THE LEFT ONE AND YES I'VE CHECKED THAT IT WAS NOT MY EAR WAX AND GONE FOR MOBILE SETTINGS AND DID THE RESTORE OF BUDS,",1
1639,Don't buy it,"Eardubds delivered on 18th Oct 2020 and left earbud stop working in 27th Oct 2020. Unfortunately my return window is closed on 26th.

Poor quality from mi.

Amazon must think about their customers who are being cheated .",1
1640,In Budget but lot of compromises,"In budget earphone so lot of compromises, while talking on a phone active noise cancellation is not so effective the person on the other side will not be able to hear you in noisy environment like in traffic or in crowds. For bassheads it is not recommended. Sometimes it also falls down while jogging or doing workouts but fit is good. Bluetooth connectivity is good.",3
1641,"Defective, Bad Customer Support","The right earpod stopped working the day the return period ended.
I took it to the Mi service center, they kept it for 3 days then said it has started working after cleaning.
It stopped working again after 20 days, after taking it back to the service center they cleaned it against, it again stopped working after 5 days!!",1
1642,Better to buy an earbuds with extra money,The earpiece stopped working and started showing defects which I didnt expect to happen and the return/exchange window also has been closed with a short period of 10 days. This will be reviewed in my youtube channel not to purchase this earbuds and to buy a better one.,2
1643,Heavy driver if real,The product which I ordered for the first was real and genuine product so no dought its too good but when I ordered it for second time it's it's fake product but works likr real but you will get to know after sometime so it's unmatchable with any twins gaming earbuds if real and if it's fake then haha lol,5
1644,Not recommended for taking,"Sound quality is good.
Pairing procedure is easy.
Mic is not good, other party complaint echo, lot of notice.
Noice cancellation poor.
After few months poor battery backup observed.
One Major problem is if battery in box is empty and you put earbuds in box then it will connected.",3
1645,Good purchase,"Liked it's design, connectivity is good and fast. No choosing of color option only black color is available. Using it form 4 daysbno issues found. It making to do my job easily as it is wireless.",5
1646,"usage time per full charge, BT connection stability not satisfactory","Have been using this product for around 20 days
*I seems to work for hardly 60-90 mins per full charge as against claimed 4hrs time
*there seems to be intermittent BT connection issues/glitches that I keep facing while using earbuds",1
1647,You won't be able to takes calls at all on this one!!,"Sound quality is decent not the best. Noise cancel is worst, om the contrary is picks up more environmental noises. My INR 500 wired earphonea performed better in this department. Connactivity is again decent. Low latency for Pubg works excellent. At this price probably the best in for gaming.",2
1648,Utmost disappointed,Buying from these seller ( appario Pvt Ltd) I am facing so many problems first I bought noise shots rush after one week of usage left earbuds weren't worked and I requested refunds for that it taken 3 weeks and I bought this product after return date it also gone not working very disappointed with Amazon and its products better go for boat neckbands at this price,1
1649,Poor Quality,Average earbuds. Noise cancellations is worst. Soùnd quality is Average. For the music listening purpose its Average and for calling purpose i will give Minus ratings. Dont influenced with the five star ratings and reviews.,1
1650,Worth the price,"Worthy to buy.. I use it during workout and it is amazing experience with these earbuds.
Personally I didn't feel the need for next or previous track controls in them.
Very nice product. Used bubble plugs for the first time and they are good.
The battery lasts upto 4-5 days if you use them for 2-3 hours daily.",5
1651,Terrible product,"The right earbud stopped working after a week's usage. I got it replaced with another one and once again within a week, it has stopped working. Don't buy because there's no return available either. Just wasted 2k.",1
1652,Budget friendly and good quality,"For the price paid the earbuds are totally worth it. The sound quality for a budget friendly buds is great. The battery also lasts long and connects fast. The noise cancellation is not bad either. Using it while, calling is also great as the voice is clear. The biggest plus point was they vere delivered very fast. This is the best one for the price.",5
1653,Not a good product,It has been 10 days since I have started using the earbuds and even within this short period of time one ear piece has stopped working and is completely dead. I will not purchase any other thing from Amazon again as this product was proved completely faulty.,1
1654,Worst battery life . Failed promise of 12 hrs,"Worst battery, stands for 2hrs and gives the warning beep, so frustrating.

Bluetooth connectivity is again worst, somtimes breaks and doesn't work post 30 mts, not sure if it's happening only for me or others also.. sound quality is amazing and but for 2 hrs..no use",1
1655,One earbud (left) sound was almost 50% less But New One is Great,Seems defective One earbud (left) sound was almost 50% less however right earbud sound was quite impressive looking at it’s cost. I have returned it and ordered a new piece. Received the new product and this works great. Sound quality is very good at high volume however low volume the bass is not so good. Overall value for money.,4
1656,Overall bad experulience,"It is a good product, but one of the ear buds got faulty after few days.. I had replace them from local service center but after few days one of the ear bud again got faulty",1
1657,Could be way better.,"Didn't like the product.. in comparison to normal earphones, there is no proper base, no proper clarity and some more it said it has a feature of gaming without lag, which I don't think happened. Had to sadly return on the day I got it.",2
1658,Best Earbuds from Redmi.,One of the best Earbuds from Redmi. Thank You Redmi. Thank You Amazon.,5
1659,Amazing product..must buy,Its a amazing product from redmi.. sound quality is great..base is proper for a product which is for a affordable budget.. overall its a product which is highly recommendable,5
1660,Worst for calling. Good for only music.,"Treat it as earphones without mic.
Poor sound quality recieved at the other end.
2 stars is only for listening to music , u can't play pubg because ur teammates won't be able to listen to you clearly. And same goes for calls.",2
1661,Budget friendly,"If you’re looking for earbuds that are budget friendly then this one is the best as it has good battery life amazing sound quality and automatic connectivity is what I liked the most.
It’s best for people who wants to use it for zoom meetings and all.
And it fits well.
Don’t expect to much in this budget but yes overall I loved the product.",5
1662,Really good,Excellent product but not for people who loves more bass effect..its a decent product of this price range..its really good for people who went out for jogging walking gym etc,5
1663,Nice product,"Sound quality is good according to the price, bass is not that much, there were some connection problems but were easily fixed by following some tutorials on youtube, built quality is okay, the cap of the case can get loose over time, earbuds are really comfortable and the weight is really less. Overall a good purchase.",4
1664,Wireless headset in nominal price. Good to buy....,"Likes:
It is weight less. Good for songs and calls. Gaming latency mode on mobile is okay. Standby was not bad.

Dislike:
Not compatible with PlayStation 4.

Ps: Ear buds small size is missing in packet (only 1 bud is received).",4
1665,Worst product,"I'm writing this review after using for a month.
The Product is the worst one I've ever used!
Than these earbuds, we can go for the normal boat wired earphones. The bluetooth connectivity is so poor that if you put mobile in your pocket and try to listen music, the music would be cracked",1
1666,"Worst earbuds, not recommended","1st main worst thing is, when you are in call on webex/G meet/zoom etc and if any other call came on you mobile in between then earbuds got disconnected n it ll not pair again, to connect them again you need to switch off n on it then only it will connect,
Battery backup on phone call is 1 hour only
I will never recommend it.",1
1667,Value for money,"Great sound quality.
Great battery life.
Mic is also great, I am using it for daily calls/meetings without worrying about the background noise like from fan or kitchen.
would recommend this to everyone who wants to have wireless earphones in a budget.",5
1668,BETTER GO FOR ONEPLUS Z EVENTHOUGH NOT TRULY WIRELESS,"Well first the battery stand by is ver very less.
Next when it comes to manipulation of sound you cant increase or decrease volume or even change to next/previous song. Next is as usual poor connectivity and the sound quality at the start was good and eventually became like a CHINA MADE one and me being a POC F1 user has faced the above problems.",2
1669,"Overall best , value for money 💰","Negative points :

1- there's no battery indicator on the case, so we couldn't figure out how much battery is left and can keep on charge accordingly.

2- it easily slips out of hand .",3
1670,Defective product .please refund my money,I have returned one item and got this product on replacement . This also we are facing the same problem. Left earbud is not at all connecting with right earbud. Left earbud is totally defective. U can see the photos that one light is blinking that one is right earbud. Left earbud is totally dead. I want refund on this product. Iam not at all satisfied with product.,1
1671,Best for the price,These earphones are good. And for the price I think currently there is no better option than this. The case looks very good in matte black finish but doesn't look very durable. It can handle some drops but take care of it.,4
1672,Dont buy this,"I have received this ear bud on oct 21 2020, We were checked it was working fine...suddenly the left bud was not working from nov 16 2020. So i have booked slot in mi service center they replaced with new one. Again today nov 20 2020 the right ear bud is not working. This is a not good launch such wireless headset from the brand of MI so dont buy such wireless head from MI brand.",1
1673,Regarded connectivity,"Its not working properly and also i am unable to connect my both fhe earbuds s at same time.
I followed every step through which i can get both earbuds s working on same time. But its not working
Very disappointed with this thing",1
1674,"Trick for restart,if buds was not functioning after initial days of usage","Sound quality 4/5
Noise cancellation 3/5
bass quality 4/5
Best buds for entry TWS users. Initial days of usage,buds suddenly stops functioning.
In that situation, please make this trick:- ""click the button on the bud and keep it in the case with out release the button for some seconds. Its just the restart procedure""
Thank me later🙏",5

I didn't like the way it was when it was delivered but the buds and everything inside were working perfect",4
1679,Good product but missing charging cable,"Overall good product at a reasonable price.
Lots of features and works well for daily usage. Not the best but manageable with all good features and quality at this given price.
Charging cable could have been a miss from seller /company.",4
1680,Truly amazing tws earphones at unbelievable price,Sound quality is good bass is Excellent and our all good package at honest price xiaomi thanks for this grateful product at this price point,5
1681,Best in class.,"Best in class earbuds. Sound experience same as mi earphones. Fits well in ears. Syncs well with with videos. Minimal latency that can be ignored in PUBG, after starting gaming mode. Easy connection and can connect with any bluetooth device as I'm using with my smartphone and laptop. No master-slave connection.
Overall great deal for money..!!",5
1682,Not worth it!,"I can't believe that redmi would produce such cheap non functionable product, bought this one during the great indian sale.. Within a week, the left pair stopped working after a week the seller send another one which apparently stopped work after a week. And now the return window is close and I can't even return it.. If anyone can help me out that will be great..",1

2nd time returned and satisfied that I got refund ..aaah..just stopped right earbud after 10 min use.. please don't buy. Go for other brand but not this one, please otherwise u will have to repent after that. Sound quality is good but reliability can't say how far it will run",1

1686,great sound quality,"I am a fitness addict and I wanted earbuds so I looked for it on amazon and I found this product since I have been using redmi products from starting so I had trust on it that's is the reason I bought it.

must try it once love it
:))))))",5
1687,Issues faced,"Sound and everything is good, but issue in box socket. Doesn't get disconnected from the phone when put back in the case. I need to turn off the Bluetooth to disconnect it. Very tiresome when you need to turn on and off the Bluetooth everytime you want to use it.",2

1691,Earbuds,"Complete value for my price
In such a range its the best product seen so far.
The noise cancellation is amazing and the pods are so comfortable that it fits great in the ear.
The quality of the case is also pretty good.
Can enjoy music anytime anywhere cause the battery life is too good.
Its a complete package for the money that i spent.",5
1692,Low Sound on Call.,"I don't think this product is upto the mark. Atleast it should have fulfilled basic requirements.
When I coonect to the call my voice doesn't reach to another person clearly. It's Chinese product. I shouldn't have bought this. PLEASE REFUND MY MONEY",1
1693,Not worth the money . Connection issues are frequent.,"It encounters an error of sound dipping down every second , after using for 2 hours. Then you have to restart the headset. The sudden change in volume brings the volume bar on screen . That gets irritating . And during calls , sometimes the left mic works , sometimes the right one. Not sure why it's happening .",3
1694,Nice Product,"These are the perfect earpods Fits in so nicely and is hardly visible to due to its tiny size .
Needless to mention that the sound quality is top notch . The sound is crystal clear . The come in a small box and are so easy to carry . A must buy product.",5
1695,The worst thing that can happen from Redmi.,"The right side earbuds stopped working within 10 days.
This is very very shameful for such a good brand.
Never ever expected that from Redmi.
I want to have a refund or a replacement for my product asap anyhow.
Plzzz look into it @amazon @Redmi",1
1696,You can get better one at this price range,"This is not so great product. I think we can get better ones at this price. If u walk around, the ear buds could fall easily and the charge is finished quickly. You can only use the earbuds for maximum 3 hours if it's fully charged
The positive is that it comes handy and weightless.",3
1697,"Great for calls, music and travel friendly","The earbuds have a sleek and stylish design and is light weight which makes it handy to carry around. It provides great noise cancellation during calls providing clear voice. It can be used during jogs or workouts as it is sweat proof. It supports voice assistants like Alexa, siri. It has a multi function button which controls play pause , answer end calls and voice assistant",5
1698,Not for long tern use!,"It's been 9 months I'm using these earbuds and here's my review.

Definitely not for long term usage it was good initially a good product but after some time I was facing issues with battery life and connectivity. Also the bass and sound quality e is not very very good it's ok a but not good. Nearly zero bass.",2
1699,Please read reviews before you buy,Keeps disconnecting. The sound clarity is not that great. Doesn't offer the crisp. Lot of noise in the sound. The bluetooth connectivity is the worst. And the battery life is also bad. Boat rockers give better life for battery. Drains very quick.,2
1700,Good for punchy music and gaming,"It is wonderful for punchy music as it’s bass is not so good but then acceptable for this price and gaming mode is amazing no audio latency but mic will echo bcoz speaker and mic are close but good battery backup . Worth trying. But buy it for android as you can increase base by yourself in sound settings. Nice , lightweight and comfortable.",3
1701,Waste,"Trust me guys this is total waste...
Mic range is soo soo strong that talking on call is impossible...the other person hears too much background noise that it causes disturbance....
Battery is not upto mark..
It gets lagg while connecting to laptop...

1703,Don't buy .look for an alternative in this price point.,"Cons: After 7 days of usage left earbud stopped working and not getting charged ,led light not blinking any more ,same problem faced by many users.I think look for an alternative in this price point. Pros: Design is nice and battery backup is also good , but sound quality is good but not loud and distortion at higher volumes.",1
1704,One Ear bud stopped working and is not charging,"As per the price i paid it was pretty decent to use it for a while, but now suddenly one earbud stopped working and isn't charging. I have asked for a replacement but i didn't had the outer packaging that comes with the amazon scan code due to covid precautions. I can't get a replacement and amazon wasn't helpful. Can someone please help?",1
1705,Cheap plastics and poor sound quality,After using few days i came to know this is very very cheap product which not worth for 1800rs we can get these type of quality TWS for 800-900/- in outer market. Go for oneplus wireless z instead of these they worth the price.,2
1706,Most important thing is I got charging capacity in affordable price.,"I think it""s sound quality is best, because always I used single bud , and it is enough for listening song or call, or watch any video.noise cancellation power is very strong...and also weight less easy to use for 5-6 hrs. There will be no irritation on ear.",5
1707,Sale=missing accessories,"The box is supposed to come with a charger and inter hamgeable eartips.
Came with neither..
I guess by buying on sale. U liose the basic accessories that come in the bix.
#SALE🙄",1
1708,Redmi flawed,"The redmi that I first ordered had the issue of the earbuds. One side wasn't functioning. Now when I got it exchanged for the other one, again on the other redmi, the issue arised with the battery. The battery wouldn't charge. Now finally, im getting my money back for the nuisance I invested in",1
1709,Small in size big in value,"These buds are definitely better than the boat ones I was using before, settles in war perfectly and are comfortable for sure. Battery backup is also good, but the main feature is definitely the size. Smaller yet clear sound and very good bass. Overall very nice buds for 1.3k.",5
1710,Satisfied with the quality.,"I am using this redmi earbuds 2c from couple of days, sound quality is nice and hardly any distortion observed at higher volume.
Pretty good for calling too with noise cancellation feature.
Bass seems to be dynamic.
Overall pocket friendly buds and value for money.",5
1711,I want my money back!!!,"The right earphone doesn't charge and I had to get it replaced... When the new one arrived it had the same problem... Not worth buy... And the seller, I want this to be returned and I want my money back... This is just annoying!!! I have hardly had problems with the products I have bought... But this one is just problem land product...",1
1712,Great product for great price,"I love the sound quality in this with the bass boost drivers in it...!!!
The only thing is the touch controls work 8/10 times.
I got used to it after 1 day, now there's no problem.
If you are thinking to buy redmi earbuds s then please don't,spend 200 more for realme it is much much better than redmi in all terms..!",5
1713,not value for money,the sound quality is not good at all while on calling the person to whom you are talking will listen lots of disturbance from your side . bass of these earbuds produce while playing songs is not good and up to expectation. From my side I don't advice to buy these ear buds . try to save money and bought some good earbuds .,2
1714,One of its not working and not getting charge bad ears buds wastage of money,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It doesn't had good quality of charging system and it have given only the option for 7 day replacement.. now one of its working other one is not working so i want replacement if it not replace then i will go to gallery of this company and given very another bad feedback about this product i want replacement of this",1
1715,My Opinion about Redmi Earbuds S,"If u r on a budget less than 2000, and do not want to compromise on music quality, u can get it. These earbuds are for music lovers and might disappoint those who want to have it for calling purposes.",4
1716,Not a worth product.,Not so good. You will not be comfortable after applying it in ears. It may fall from your ears easily. Sound quality is poor.,2
1717,Amazing light weight buds,"It's an amazing product, great finish, pretty light weight, sounds great, convenient to pair with smartphone. Cuts external noise nicely. Must buy if you are planning to go wireless.",5
1718,One earbud stopped working ..MONEY WASTE....,"Buyied it 9 days ago.
It's scrap i can say
One ear bud stopped working on 10th day & now i cant rerurn or exchange also as this options are not avaliable now.
Very unsatisfactory result... Highly Not recommended to purchase",1
1719,Best for this price segment,"Day 1 :- build quality is good.
Case looks small and good build
Punchy base trbl is low so much base
no problems while playing PUBG with
low letency ON.
It got disconnected automatically and
got connected while playing pung .",4
1720,Value for money,Was confused when I read the reviews since the reviews were mixed.But found them pretty good at this price point.Sound quality is good.Bass is good when you use equaliser. connectivity is also great.Only thing I didn't like is that case is little bit flimsy.Can't expect more at this price.,4
1721,Cool earbuds,"Awesome earbuds. Light weight and easy and fitting in ears.
Sound quality is too good . The bass and treble is perfectly balanced and the noise cancellation is also good.
The backup of earbuds is also nice with decent battery. I use it for 2-3 days after charging fully once. And the price is too low according to the quality of the product.",5
1722,Earphones of high quality,"The product had no problem when it arrived and the sound quality,noise cancellation and Bluetooth connectivity was all fine . I think that according to the rate of the product the quality of the product is high. I feel the earphones are loud enough to make a person def😀!!",5
1723,Noise cancellations is to bad and not useble in outdoor.,In this earpod noise cancellation is to bad i am used already replaced but still this problem facing that is not ok at the time of calling in outdoor side but the body of earpod and bluetooth connectivity is too good and 12 hrs using capicity available in 1 time charging in this earpod problems is only sound and noise cancellation.,1
1724,It's not working properly,"Totally my money waste for resmi earbuds

Team, Just six month before I ordered resmi earbuds. Buds not working properly and same voice also not good. I need refund for that. Kindly accept my request to repurchase for another product.

Thanks & Regards

1725,Good product at its price however for noise reduction I donot see it is that useful,"Apart from noise reduction on mic, everything is good in this product. It catches the surrounding noise and mic experience is not good however this product is good if you want to listen to music or using it for phone calls. For my online office meeting i do not use this.",4
1726,Price worthy buds.,"I have been using these buds . Since couple of weeks now and must tell you these buds are very much handy and does the jobs pretty well. Noise cancellations works on call, bass quality is amazing and connectivity is also very good. Go for it.",5
1727,Broke after 3 months !,Broke after just a few months of use. The buds dont get charged in the case. They stay connected even if its closed in the case. Tried resetting and everything. Not worth the money. Better to spend a bit more and get something better like oneplus bus or skull candy,1
1728,Good for normal used,Sound quality is good for calling & normal used but not good sound as like JBL,3
1729,Affordable,Simple. All etc things are basic but at this price ear buds are available only in mi. And dont go for bass.,4
1730,Great build and sound quality for the price,"Amazing product for the price. Clear mids and good lows. Decent battery life makes it a good driving companion, easy to pair. Looks and feels sturdy, made with good quality plastic. A must buy",5
1731,About Mi earbud S,As far as I know its way better than I thought..noise cancelation is pretty good! Sound quality is good. The only thing is I got issues while gaming ..if I use this pod and use mike in game sound automatically switches to my phone's speaker and once I off the mike sound comes back to the pod. Other than this everything is awesome! Love it! But gamers beware !,5
1732,Defective product | Waste of Money,"Bought it for my sister. When we started to use next 2 days it was working properly but after 2 days left bud stop working. So I replaced it but same issue happen after 2 days again.
Personally I suggest pls don't buy this product. I bought 3 pieces and all are defective.",1
1733,Overhyped like anyother Redmi product,"Sound quality is not good at all. Don't expect balances sound, expect only bass covering every aspect of your music. Supports only SBC which is fine in this price bracket. I faced quality issues, had a wobbly button on left earbud so returned the item for good.",1
1734,Battery life not even 50% to what is claimed,"Pros
1. Slim Design, weight is good
2. Fit well in ear

1765,Not for music lovers,"The sound quality is not up to the mark. Also the right earbud has lower sound output than the left earbud.

Have tried using it with different iPhones and an android phone but the problem remains the same.

Can be used for calling purposes but not for music lovers.

Returning it immediately.",1
1766,Redmi buds good,"Very lightweight and handy. Although small in size ,they give good battery backup...bass could have been a bit better but overall sound quality is above average...fit in ear tightly, don't fall during exercise or walking.

Got a new one in warranty and one bud is not working",1
1771,Bang average,"Anything less than 1500 price is fair price for it.
But quality wise bang Average with just fine sound quality , poor calling quality and weirdly facing lag in audio when watching Netflix.

Having budget constraint then go for it.. otherwise you still might get better product.",3

No idea,4
1776,Worst product from MI,"Worst product from MI,I love mi product but this was worst worst worst worst product। Every time problem created in connecting, sometime only one earbuds play and the second one is off always creating this type of problem। Just my opinion for everyone please don't buy this product ( Traah product)",1
1777,Worst ever product,I have barely used the product. It's been a month since I bought and the charging case or the right earbud has stopped working completely. It is not getting charged. I am not sure what is to be done. The battery backup is worst and the sound quality in outside location is worst as well,1
1778,Read full review.,Value for money.sound quality and bass is good.but there are some problems like sometimes on call the other person can't hear what you say and second is when you pause or play your music using earbuds button your ear will definitely get hurt. Overall it's good for under 2k but I would suggest you to buy neckband.,4
1779,Absolute trashy product.,"The product is a trash. Sound goes on/off frequently. Left earbud stopped working within 4 days so had to replace the earbuds but the second pair I received had the same problem after 10 days. There is a problem with frequent disconnection. Sound quality is average, bass is non existent, pathetic product.",1
1780,Not for music lovers,"Not best for music- would say poor.

Best for calling - would say good.

If you want to listen to music then do not purchase this.",3
1781,Sound super!! Bass disappointing!! 🥺😔,"I've been using this for almost 15 day's. It's shape and size is good. Flexible for my ear.
But telling about the bass quality.. it's not that much as I expected. After a particular limit the sound and bass..sound quality is ok but bass disappointing.
Calling is also super. Voice is perfectly clear.",3
1782,One piece stopped working within 15 days,"Third class experience from Redmi.
Its worst than unbranded China phones as one piece stopped working within 15 days.
Request all to not buying such bad quality product.
Also no service center is answering in Ahmedabad for earbud.",1
1783,"PUBG support , i can guarantee it","Let me clear something, you can play PUBG with this , just turn on gaming mode(press the button 3 times to activate) , i am using iphone 8 and tested on ipad air also.",5
1784,Only for movies & games Not for calls,"Awesome in budget rate but not good for picking calls
i tried speaking and many were complaining about mic,
so finally decided not to use for call.
battery backup was good (44 minutes series - 3 episode continuously watched)",4
1785,Mindblown!,"I've got senhesier wired earphones, and I can debate that these sound even better than those! Wayyyy too good, especially at 1.7k.

Only drawback? It has buttons & not touch sensitive ones, but hey, can't complain, too good, in love with these.",5
1786,Not that great for this value,The device seems good at initial use. The package received is not in great condition though. And there is no charging cable inside. Also one bud keep charging even the other is charged.,4
1787,Not happy with the product...,Bought on 1st Nov recieved product on 3rd November and today not working right ear bud. Don't know the reason. Return window closed on 11th November itself. Feeling bad issue in the short span. Don't recommend because delicate and issue in 10 days itself,3
1788,This product is worse....,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I dislike this product because when i bought it then after one month right earbud stopped automatically and on that time i don't have any option....so guyzz....please aware from these worse products..even i dont got any guarantee card inside the box....",1
1789,Tired of replacements but turned out good,The ear buds had issues and has to request for replacements when ordered the last two times. It is very disappointing regarding the defective product. However the product has been good with timely delivery of the same.,3
1790,Great product,The product is excellent but it should come with a charging cable.. one is not sure if the cable being used for the ear pods is right... Else they are great. Don't support 12 hrs though but that's ok.,4
1791,Don’t purchase this product,Don’t purchase this product. Sometimes the music not played well. While i connect this earbuds the music was not clear and frequently played once i turn of the Bluetooth the song was played well. After a month i got scar in my right ears. Even there is no indication for full charge.,1
1792,True Review Posted,This earbud is good only for listening music but if you are trying to talk when you are on call then these are the worst as the next person will not be able to hear your voice and neither you...dont buy...go for some good brands,2
1793,1 wireless is not working,"is very poor
Sound quality - 8/10
Design -8/10
Call experience -7
But the real issue is that its facing some connectivity issue...its like for 1 to 2 sec n then suddenly it gets normal again
Connectivity - 4/10 (connecting with oppo k3) even if u cover ur earbud by ur hand it is start disconnecting.",5
1794,Average quality of sound and noise cancellation,"It's good for office and home only for talking (If your expectations are higher for listening of songs please don't buy). When you will talk from outside or from traffic the receiver will complain about background noise (which is not in case of wired head phone).

Over all its a good product in such price range.",3
1795,Best Product in This Budget,The Product is absolutely amazing and gives you a amazing noice cancellation and surround sound but battery life is not worth of price but with the given charging box it works for approximately 5 hours So in my opinion this Product is one of the best competitor in this price range.,5
1796,Very bad experience with redmi,"Very very very bad experience with this product
This is m first time to buy Redmi earbuds
When I open the package than data cable is missing with the earbuds
I can't recommend to a single person to buy Redmi ear buds",1
1797,For listening music that’s good,"This is good but price is little high .
On call noise will be more and you have to speak loudly.
For music it’s ok
And there 5-6 hours battery backup not 12 hours",4
1798,Creates problem in internet.,"Doens't even work with Redmi phones, It causes impedance in internet, never works with zoom or Whatsapp call, internet just doens't work for calls, but as soon as I shift to wired earphones calls start going through.

An Avid Mi User, Expected better from Mi.",1
1799,Best bang for the buck,I did a lot of research before buying this product . for this price this is a great product works very well and connect seamlessly with an iPhone. The only thing it would have had was a charging indicator,5

1801,Good sound But Bass and loudness little Low,"Sound quality was good but Loudness and bass is little low for me.
It connects really Fast and battery backup is also Good. Overall for ₹1300 its a good product But I'd recommend if you love bass and Little loud music Don't Go for it. Raise your budget a little and get some other earpods like boat or something.",3
1802,Think before you place the order.,Product is good. But one bud stopped working on 2nd day of use.,1

1977,Experience is bad,"I am hearing some xinng kind of noise while in a call or listening music. Bass is not working at all. Always a volume sign is displaying in the mobile screen. Can you please help me to understand this problems or issues or bugs?

What is the solution for that?

Waste product for ever.",1
1978,"FAULTY EARBUDS, EVEN REPLACEMENT",It's for the second time that these earbuds have turned out defective. Even the replacement is faulty. The left earbud just stopped working out of nowhere. Either the supplier is sending faulty earbuds or is getting defective products. Horrible experience. 2 earphones in 2 days. Have sought a refund.,1
1979,"Good for music, not for calls",The sound quality for music is pretty decent. But one cannot take calls with this as it picks up a lot of ambient noise and the other person cannot hear clearly.,3

1982,Strongly recommendale to all👍,Amazing product. Best sound quality and bass. I will strongly recommend it to all because it is one of the best that i have used until now.,5
1983,Competitive pricing. But small manufacturing errors.,My earphones sometimes connect to the phone even when they are in the case. They don't attach to the magnets strongly and end up not charging properly. This could be a one off case. But imo it is a major design flaw.,3

Only 3hours back not 12hour sound quality 0%
Not Best its poor product quality from Redmi",1

INSHORT, DON'T BUY.",1
2001,Everything is good except the controls.,"The earbuds are very good and the sound quality is also excellent. The only problem I faced with the earbuds the lack of control options. Every time I have to change songs or increase/decrease volume I have to go to my phone.
This makes the experience bad.",4

2006,"No compromise, budget earbuds",I have been using this for 1 week now. It is pretty awesome. The build quality and connectivity are very good. The only downside is the sound quality due to bass. Except that it is very clear and loud. Check out my full review of the product on technosports.co.in,4
2007,after 6 months of use,I dislike its battery life about three hours then u need to put into case so it can charge again n charging incase is not rapid let me tell u .,3

2010,Earbuds from Redmi,Good quality but it is capturing the nearby noise. So not able to use it when outside on the road even it is capturing noise people talking in the next room.,5
2011,Not Working properly,"Seriously lot of issues with the buds. Not working properly, can't able to connect to Bluetooth, can't able to hear on the other side, one bud not charging in the case. Lot of issues. Be aware before purchasing. Less cost means less quality. Don't fall for it.",1
2012,Unsatisfied,"Redmi Earbuds S is okay type product, however, the noise cancelling is poor for phone call. Sound quality and bass are okay but not good I use it for playing songs. Also, it last for only 3 to 4 hours approximately. Hence, I don't like it.",2

2015,"Certain connectivity issues, overall good.","It’s a good product overall. I however have faced issues with respect to connectivity.

Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well.

Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly. i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only. There is a thread on this sellers dubious deals in quora. Please be safe and don’t regret after.",1
2022,Solid premium phone from Apple,Awesome Phone. Nice upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Love this beautiful phone.,5
2023,Worst Experience Ever.!,"My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon. Now they are saying To Go Icare services( After Calling to customer care several times) Amazon can’t do anything For this . Worst Experience with Amazon. No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .",1
2024,First Time iPhone User Review :-),"The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.

Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.

The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).

Cons:

1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.

2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.

Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).

But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.",5
2025,iPhone 11,"Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return fast
Very very bad experience",1
2026,Defective Iphone 11,The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .,1
2027,Too much heat on normal use,"Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue. Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have not paid 70k for a defective phone. I am feeling like got scammed.

Edit - I returned this phone and got refund from amazon and bought the same from flipkart ..and it got no issues .",1
2028,Provided with a defective product,"Provided with defective product .
Struggling for replacement since then .
There are so many hidden terms and conditions.
It's my last order on Amazon",1
2029,not a good product,"hello
Please dont take any apple products online , especially if the seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd.
I bought iphone 11 last month and suudenly today (17/08/2020) the phone got switched off and not getting switched on again.It was neither damaged nor it got wet in rains . I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust. My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.
This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.
My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller.",1
2030,Dont rush to buy and waste your money,"If its just looks what you want then go ahead and buy...but its performance..then suggest you guys to back off.
I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].
After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up. Show some sense of urgency towards customer issues.
Ok...folks its upto you to buy or not, just sharing my own experience so it will help who are thinking to buy this.",1
2031,Best iPhone ever | Super Night Mode | Super Camera | Yellow,"In my opinion, don’t think much about the phone , just get it . I am attaching night-mode on and off pictures. Check the difference

Pros-
1. Best Camera
2. Best Security
3. Long day Battery Life
4. Touch ID improved
5. Its an iPhone after all . 😍
6. Best Night-mode support
7. Best Processors A13 Bionic Chip

Cons-
1. Display could have been OLED in this price but if doesn’t matter . This retina lcd is really awesome.
2. Slightly bulky and weighty - if u r shifting from iPhone 7 or 8
3. Thick bezels

Guys , I am both Samsung as well as iPhone fan. But this price range I would suggest you to order iPhone 11. Its really a great deal.

And if u r a long time iPhone user . Then this will be really great for you.

Got for it Guys !!!",5
2032,Black spot found on the new phone.,I found this black spot while doing set up. Given me defective piece & now not able to give for replacement also. It's a very next day of purchase.,1
2033,Heating issue,Its my first iphone and now I’m feeling like I’ve wasted my money coz it has heating issues,1
2034,Defective model,"hi
I had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon.
But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to servers
Finding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work fine
but it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to work
today while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not working
I have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain",1
2035,Samsung s10 is better than iphone,Samsung s10 is much better than iphone 11,1
2036,iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals,"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!
Now, off to the device.

Pros
The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.
Speakers sound better than my previous phone.
A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!
OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.
Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.

Cons
Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.
Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.
No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.

Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.",5
2037,Not good product,Not good when I charge mobilebody was earth (current shock) and today charger not working I don’t no how to replace,1
2038,Not recommended,"Pathetic Amazon service!! Don't buy online. My back camera has problem, shows many green dots. Apple store is of little help. Amazon as expected, is of NO help. Waiting to get this resolved. I preferred this over pixel just for camera!!! Sigh!!!",1
2039,Look likes Chinese mobile phone {waste of my hardships},This I phone11 model {black} looks like Chinese phone.I suggest don't purchase and go with Iphone's other model.,1

2041,Don't buy from Appario Reseller,"Bought iPhone from seller Appario Retail. Phone had multiple issues such as WiFi, mobile network (no network for 10 days), facelock was working on multiple people etc in just 3 months of use.

I have given my phone to apple service center and its been 10 days and its not fixed.

STAY very careful before buying from this seller.

Read mutilple bad reviews and I think seller is selling defective phones.",1

2043,Minor damage to the product,There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it’s Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it . If not then I think I would not be buying any electronics product from Amazon it better to buy from store co I can check everything on the spot .,1
2044,iPhone 11 already opened/used,"The Apple iPhone 11 that I received today had already been opened. I got it without any deal or plastic cover.
I don’t know if it’s damaged inside I am not touching it
Please take it back and give me a completely new packed one.
I am extremely upset about this.",1
2045,IT’S A TRAP,"Worst ever! Battery health starts to drop within 3 months of usage. Camera for pictures suck when compared to OnePlus or other android phones. Phone gets heated up within 10-15 minutes of talking over calls or internet use. Apple customer care doesn’t do anything but say this is best IPhone ever and everything is good with it.
Also, I bought on EMI for 6 months with HDFC credit card with a 5000rs discount but i have to pay the EMI for the full amount gets cut every month.",1
2046,Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes.
But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy.
1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget.
2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.

Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.
1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.
2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.
3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.
4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.
5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.
6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.",5
2047,The feel of it!,"This is my 5th iPhone, iPhone 3G, 3Gs, 4S, 6 and now 11. Have used iPhone 6 more than 3.8 years.
It is true when you keen to precision then nothing else can compete with the iPhone.
Love the Portrait modes, wide-angle and the screen size.
iPhone ring, a new tone is available now.

2048,Defective handset iPhone 11,Got it on 8 th Aug did not open it due to corona . Had to travel to hp so put it into use 4 days back There is a problem with sound very low sound have to put it on speaker to hear the conversation . How can a new brand phone have this problem kindly look into it . Also in this corona time the return/replace window should be a little more relaxed as we senior citizens will not take this risk of using it immediately . Kindly look into the matter asap,1
2049,worst product worst service,worst phone and worst service..I bought from amazon and new phone had excessive heating issue..tried contacting amazon but no help was given..wasted my money n then had to run after apple people for new phome defect and its been 2 weeks i dont hav my phone..dont buy atleasr from amazon,1
2050,Best ever,"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys!!",5
2051,Lack of customer loyalty and too many faulty devices,Freaking pathetic when the phone was a defective piece and wanted to replace/refund.. they say contact the apple brand and when I go to them they say they don't have any connection since it was bought from Amazon and when I contacted the Amazon someone names ( TANMAYA) was in touch as customer service agent was trying to toss me around here and there ...and when I ask for a denial letter that Amazon and they claim they aren't responsible for this..,1
2052,With a new design and good features,"This phone is bit big to hold but good for Android users.
As per the design review, the phone is excellent with great camera both normal and wide angle, a good sound quality and the replicate feature was awesome to to copy data from old iPhone to your new iPhone.",5
2053,Absolutely LOVE it !!!,"I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.
Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!
The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.
Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).
So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.",5
2054,Awesome product...great price,the product is good and working up to expectations....sorry for miss understanding the issue and I was under the impression that the product was defective...as I wasn’t hearing the voice of other person speaking....this happened because of thin flap of covering on screen,1

After giving it to the service center it had to be sent to Bangalore where it was replaced and sent back to me again. But I was without my phone for almost a month. My phone is working fine now but all in all it was such a hassle. Never buy an apple product from this retailer called appario retail pvt ltd.Best to buy it from the store.",1
2057,Received faulty phone,"Received faulty phone.

Don't buy here, buy from store. I am suffering from a problem with this phone but Amazon is directing me to the iPhone store now rather than return or replacement, so what's the point in purchasing from amazon.",1
2058,"Read it, it is helpful!!!!","The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it
. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .
But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz . And the build quality is good but if it one times fall from your hand it is gone . Even from a small distance you can get small visual small cracks",3

2060,Damaged Phone Supplied by Amazon,"Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform. The phone delivered to me yesterday was in damaged condition with vertical line on the screen.
After contacting Amazon I was asked to take a note from authorised Apple service centre. Even after doing the same I was asked by one of the Amazon representative again to get one more letter from service centre. To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.
Horrible experience with #Amazon. 😭
Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone. Further I don't have idea for battery, face recognition and camera as I was not able to use iphone 11 and till now I have only bitter experience.",1
2061,Great smartphone! Value for money!! & Premium feel!!!,"If you are an Android user who wants to move to iOS, then this is the best iPhone you can get without spending unnecessary huge amount on pro versions.

I myself would have preferred OLED displays over LCD display on iPhone 11 but I just bought the iPhone 11. Trust me the display is very very good on this phone & with all the same chipset as the pro versions, there's really not much that you are losing.

You won't regret this purchase if you want to start using iOS! Everything is very fluid & I like it a lot!! Don't think will be moving to Android in future.",5
2062,Average,"Display is not at par. even after adjusting the colour settings. More of Yellow tint.
Screen width is not suitable for e- reading in phone.
Top notch is disturbance for watching videos in full screen.
Keyboard is occupying half of the phone space.
Camera, I think my expectations are on higher side.
Side button disconnects the call and doesn’t lock the screen during the calls.

However phone performance and sound are good.
In my opinion I should have waited for iPhone 12.",3
2063,Best thing that money can buy,"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!",5
2064,Nice Build and Overall champion,Battery life is good. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage. Performs well in day to day task. Mine is a made in india model which feels nice. Weight of the phone is a little downside. It feels heavy at 192gms,5
2065,Beast with a limp,"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.
The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.
Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.
Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.
The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.
One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.
Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.
I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.",4
2066,Overall a great phone just not a perfect one.,"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:
Pros:
A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]
The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]
Somewhere between great to excellent battery life
The software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDIC
The phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.

Cons:
Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.
You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.
The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.
And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.

Conclusion with personal thoughts:
Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.",4
2067,Phone Awesome. Amazon Service Bad.,"MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April’2020. Is this justified?

Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviour

Now come to the phone-

Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this.

Battery also taking too much time to get charged
Mobile is heating after half an hour of use",2
2068,Refurbished prod,I want to return the product because it looks like a refurbished one however no one is contacting with me not taking order. Please do no buy it because its not a new product and also you can not return it,1
2069,BAD EXPERIENCE WITH AMAZON,"NEVER GO FOR AMAZON IF IT'S I PHONE....

Had some issues with lock screen... When informed and asked for replacement, Amazon agents said me to visit a I store...

There is more chance of getting a refurbished phone in the name of new phone... Be careful... Don't buy goods of this worth from online sites...",1
2070,The best is here !,"Phenomenal is the word , apple finally clicks in India with its predatory pricing and top notch feature which makes it hard to let go.

The battery is running strong and the added extra camera is a plus. Apple you aced this one.",5
2071,iPhone 11 review after 3 months!,"This is phone is amazing!
Face ID : responsive and super save!!
Camera: It’s the best feature of this phone! Really good camera.
Display: it’s still good! When compared to a one plus 7 and 8. It’s just brighter but it’s not sharper
If you want the best display in the game go for 11 pro.

I have no complaints on this",5
2072,Super ness Happiness,Happy Fillings,5
2073,Received a defective product and not able to return Or replace. Please do not buy online.,I have received this product with defective speakers. Amazon is saying to visit Apple website. I have no clue what to do in this regard? At first place you send us a defective product and instead of initiating a replacement you ask us to visit Apply store. Is this even fair?,1
2074,Superb phone...Premium in hand feel,"Pros:
Camera quality is 09/10.
Display 09/10
Battery life 10/10
Heating issue : I face no heating issue
Product genuineess : Checked on apple site it is original.
Cons: charging speed very slow. Charger should be provided atleast 18 watt.
Aneroid user face little bit difficulty to use IOS interface.",5
2075,Received Good,The only apple product i can buy with the money left in my account is Apple juice.,4
2076,Great iPhone,"After analyzing for many months, finally took the decision to buy my first IPhone from Amazon. Kudos to Amazon, seller & delivery partner in prompt delivery as promised & in perfect condition. Below is my quick review after a month of usage -
Pros
1. Premium feel at hand & ease of use especially after coming a decade of being Android user.
2. No battery heating or draining. Lasts for about 3days with very casual usage - office call, mails, few apps. Please note i have not installed any games or heavy intense apps.
3. Camera quality is the best that i have experienced.
4. Face ID works like charm & very useful in authentication while installing apps or view the notifications on lock screen.
5. Call quality, data connection & connectivity felt immediately better compared to my earlier phone.

Cons
1. Only nick picking on the charger not being provided in this new version. IF you have any USB C charger at home, you can leverage the same to charge this phone since USB C cable is provided.
2. Cannot use 3.5mm jack based headsets. Need Bluetooth headset or lightening port connectors.

Per my experience, I would definitely recommend iPhone11 since i do not see any potential cons. I do not miss the 120Hz refresh or amoled screen while using the phone.",5
2077,"iPhone 11 comparison any mobile Ram,Performance","1.Very fast No comparison with 8,12,12Gh rams. 2. Camera great beyond MPs 48mp is nothing . Iphone camera is fast far batter.3. No comparison Androids 11.4 Light weight5ThankUApple. TODAY 19 July 2020 MY PHONE FALLEN FROM 1st floor ON HARD SURFACE. After CHECKING-0 SCRATCHIEST.——great great",5
2078,"Great phone , Very tough exchange process","PROS :
1. Excellent phone with sleek screen
2. Excellent battery lasting more than a day
3. Face recognition is smooth
CONS:
1. Just the exchange process is very very complex
If you are exchanging an old phone strongly recommend not to do so. If you wish to do so here are the steps

1. Please take complete back up in advance of the phone you like to exchange
2. Erase all data except Amazon app. Even if you have the Amazon app on a different phone, please have Amazon app installed on the phone which you are going to give away
3. Once the delivery agent comes to you, ask for a pin 6 digit number.
4. You have to first enter the six digit number on the phone in the Amazon app on the order. Yes, this has to be keyed in on same order you had made and there is a provision space to enter on same.
5. This step is quite complex but this is done for security to ensure you exchange the right phone.
6. Once validated (Takes about 10 to 30 minutes depending on data / passwords you have stored) you then have to provide a 6 digit OTP which you would have received on your mobile and email.
7. Then the agent verifies the 6 digit OTP on his device.
8. If this gets done, PLEASE ENSURE YOU REMOVE YOUR SIM , DELETE THE AMAZON APP AND DATA FROM THE device you are going to give away.
9. Final but most important - ensure the device is deleted from iCloud if you are exchanging iPhone . If non iPhone ensure you format the phone and ONLY THEN HAND IT OVER TO DELIVERY AGENT.
10. In any possibility it would take 10 to 45 minutes to complete the exchange steps above depending on your data on phone plus the support of delivery or customer service.
I had to wait for 24 hours to re do all steps and then went for it as I urgently needed this phone. Else best to exchange in a store nearby and just go for phone.

SUMMARY:
GREAT PHONE, GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CALL CENTER FOLKS, GREAT EXCHANGE PRICE
BUT EXTREMELY TOUGH EXCHANGE PROCESS.",3
2079,The best decision of my life,"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.",5
2080,Honest review. Must read.,"Not rating right now.
But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.

The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.

One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.
I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..
He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.

So here i am writing this.

First two days review
Battery life ok
Camera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)
Face id good
Interface once u get everything its hard to not track everything
Rest everything is typical apple
Con
Phone is heavy hahaha
Ill try to keep updating..",4
2081,Great battery+camera+Apple Quality!,"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that it’s totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, it’s been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!

If you’re looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!

There are a few bugs however, but they’re iOS bugs which’ll be sorted soon I’m sure with upcoming updates!",5
2082,New iPhone received today with dead battery!,"Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.",1
2083,Best Buy iphone!,"Awesome phone!! Specially if you’re upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!",5
2084,defective piece OR a faulty product !!,"got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself. the product is faulty . Screen flickers , touch screen becomes un-responsive, screen black out for a few seconds is common and above all the iphone heats up horribly to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone. having read on google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem. Fed up of liaising with Apple & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced",1
2085,incrediable camera,From 5s to 11,5
2086,Read this before switching from Android,"If are switching from Android here are the following things that will frustrate you in apple:
1. Video recording doesnt have pause button
2. Almost every app needs paid licence. Eg A proper pdf viewer
3. Cant save files on a folder and use it in explorer.
4. Settings of each app can only be accessed via settings and not the individual app. So eg if you are in camera app, need to change resolution, need to come out of it and change it in settings
5. There is no select all button in most apps like messaging, gmail, gallery etc. happy ticking off each item
6. Face id has this eventually annoying animation that cant be turned off.
7. If you prefer call recording, it takes a periodically paid app to place a background conference call and record at its end to show your recorded calls
8. The otg adapter is over 500 times more expensive than android otg adaptor.
9. Similarly all accessories are more expensive than their value. They just provide a snob effect
10. Sometimes you would wonder how to get to the previous screen without reaching to the far top left back button on screen. But dont worry there isnt and the gestures dont work. Eg open a product image on flipkart or amazon and try to close it. Will take some time to figure it out.
11. Display resolution is nowhere close to the similar price ranged android phones
12. The new back tap feature to take a screenshot etc often gets triggered when you keep the phone on a desk
13. There is no keyboard that shows numbers on the top line. So we have to swap no. And letter keys. Imagine entering an alphanumeric captcha
14. Cant have a blank home screen to highlight wallpaper
15. No battery % on the notification bar
16. If you have old mp3 songs, they cant be simply beamed from your old android to iphone, need to attach phone to a computer and import via itunes.
17. And dont get me started on connecting to other phones, via bluetooth or nfc. Even if you some manage to get a file on iphone, theres a good chance itll be useless. I wanted to import contacts using vcf backups. Security that puts shackles on you own feet.
18. Try changing iphone ringtone to your downloaded tune. Not possible unless we use a thirdparty app.
19. Cant even select all text from a page with a single click. What is with you people and select all?
But hey. I get to show off my new iphone 🤬",1
2087,Luckily got a good phone!,"Too new to rate. Some of the recent reviews were extremely scary for an Apple product and unfortunate that those customers were given bad products. Took a risk, ordered and told to cancel but Amazon force delivered the product. Opened and checked for defects, none so far. Made in India, product is authentic! Thankfully not a refurbished phone. Verified the warranty, started using, so far so good. Will try update review periodically for your benefit.",4
2088,Happy with the product but not happy with the old phone exchange process,"Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.",4
2089,Major issue with Mike n speaker,"I am having Mike n speaker issue, n due to lockdown I dint got chance to return it, but I dint expected this Frm amazon surely not with product like APPLE",1
2090,Fall in love,"Camera is too good, smooth touch, fantastic sound quality, fantastic look, and performance is too good",5
2091,Unbiased Review after 1 month of Usage,"Battery Life-
Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big time

Camera-
Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honest

Sound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notch

Processor- The best

Screen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCD

Value for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro",4
2092,Best device ever by apple,"Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.

Pros:-
•Wide angle camera
•Supports fast Charing
•Stunning looks
•Superb Camera quality
•Safe and secure device
•Flagship A13 Bionic Chip

Cons:-

•The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp
•Still have huge notch
•Bit costly in India",5
2093,Camera Quality is not good.,Camera is Defective.,1
2094,Not a great phone,"The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....

After one month.....
Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.",1
2095,Best performance of all time in an Iphone,You won’t regret it If you buy it .Camera quality is awesome and performance of this phone is next level. Lucky to have this phone in pocket,5
2096,Worst Camera,"Worst purchase for such huge amount that was spent. Camera quality is very poor, my galaxy s9 plus is much better than this one. Amazon doesn’t accept return but the options in the app shows return applicable. iPhone claims to have best camera and has large hoardings everywhere but in reality it’s not.
Totally regret on this purchase.",1

Within 10 days it started randomly shutting down.
Apple says it's a hardware problem
But amazon is not replacing it because return window ended 2 days back.
Amazon customer care representative clearly said that it's not amazon problem.
They have washed off their hands.

BEWARE OF AMAZON!!!!",1
2101,Worst quality iPhone was delivered,"a bad and defective piece iphone11 was delivered to me . Battery, Camera etc are substandard. Phone gets heated even while talking. Its takes 8 hours to do full charge. seller has given me a defective product",1
2102,DONT BUY IT FROM AMAZON,"the seller appario retail ltd. gives old used and defective pieces. and if you go to get replacement they(apple) dont entertain you becoz you got it from amazon. you should get apple products from apple.com . they are 4-5k costlier but atleast you know for sure that the product is new and not defective. and even when you hah\ve any issue, you can contact apple and they will help you. but if you buy from amazon, very high probability that you might get defective piece from this seller and apple wont help you much.",1
2103,Only 5 GB iCloud Storage not good!,"If you are going from Android to IOS, You are going to suffer on few things:

- Google provides 15 GB storage for google photos.
- ICloud provides only 5 GB Storage and always ask for the money to buy storage as notification.
- You will not be able to move or restore your whats app data from Android to IOS without using any 3rd party paid software.

- Camera Quality is Awesome.
- Battery is OK.
- Look is awesome.
- Face Recognition is also OK.
- Sound is nice.
- Touch experience is top notch for the Android users.
- Single SIM can be inserted and 2nd SIM would be eSIM and will have to visit Airtel store or JIO Store.

- iCloud storage is low for photos.
- Battery would have been better.
- Earphone/EarPods or charger cannot be used as the sametime.",3

2109,The phone hangs,"Moved to this phone from samsung s8. Transition to ios is easy, however, I miss a lot of android features which are very easy to include in ios but for some reasons not implemented. Battery life is great. Camera is good too, however, i miss the raw support. A bit bulky and screen could be better. Hangs a few time which was not expected from iphone. Charger is too slow. Should be getting a fast charger with a phone of this price.",3
2110,So far so good...(1 week user),"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!

This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:
1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.
2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.
3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.
That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.

I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.

First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.

Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.

User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.

Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.

Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.

Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.

earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.

Overall user experience:
Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.
Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.
Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.
Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.
Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.
2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.
3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.

One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.

Hope this review helps next buyer.",4

Detail Explanation of problems faced:
I bought the iPhone 11 128GB Black during Amazon big billion days happened between 16 Oct 2020 to 22 Oct 2020. Orderd on 16 Oct 2020 and it got delived on 18 Oct 2020. As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre.",1
2112,Disappointed with amazon,"Phone is great but I am really disappointed by amazon service. It was applicable for bonus 1 offer and I was suppose to get cashback of 1250 and an executive said expect it by wednesday but when it dint credit on chking with amazon executive again they said its not applicable!
There was no stars or mentioned in FAQs that iphone is not applicable for bonus.
Felt like wrong advertisement, cheated and really disappointed by amazon offers and services. Been amazon customer for years and this experience is really was very disappointing. Feels like lost the trust in amazon :( Wrong advt and incorrect offers was just never expected from amazon!",5
2113,Defective product,One speaker of mobile is not working,1
2114,Defective battery,"Battery is defective
After charging 100per the battery percentage drops into zero(0)
From nowdays I will never trust Amazon .....
It's not a single penny it's about 48k
For common person it's huge amount
And no one will not accept such defective items.
Meanwhile I tried to return but Amazon
Directly said talk to apple
Is that fair ?
@AMAZON
I can say loudly that Flipkart is far better than Amazon I know theirs item price is high but atleast they care after being delivered",4
2115,Best in class,"I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years.
Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.
On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.
Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.
Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.
And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.",5
2116,Refurbished,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Really disappointed. This purchase has saddened me so much. This was my first iPhone purchase ever, I was so happy but when I unboxed the product, I saw a gap between the frame and back glass, this may be a refurbished product. I will not purchase costly products again from Amazon.",1
2117,The best you can get!,"It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.

I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.",5
2118,❤️ Android,"it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.
Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:

> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone
> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.
> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up
> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone
>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.
> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time",2
2119,Awesome buy,"Buttery smooth with superb display comparable to Samsung's super amoled(but lacks contrast nd easy on eyes)
Awesome camera
Lcd has its own benifit(features like true tone combines to give best lcd in market now)
Cons are few but major is
heating up a bit(but mostly during gaming)
13.1.2 is little buggy software update might solve all issues...
Overall device is bang for bucks",4
2120,Think carefully and enquire well about its limitations before ordering,"There is no option for return. If there os any problem with the phone and its features. You cannt return this device.
Amazon says contact with Apple store . Apple store says Return not permitted.
So think carefully and enquire well about its limitations before ordering this device.",1
2121,The iPhone for everyone!,"Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.
First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that.
Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.
✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.
✅ All-day battery life.
✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance.
✅ Wireless charging
✅ An extra ultra-wide camera
✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)
✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.
But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.

A high recommendation for this product.",5
2122,Disgusted...!!!,"Never buy apple products on Amazon, I had worse experience of buying iphone 11. I got a refurbished phone for a premium price more over there is no customer support at all on the app.",1
2123,"Welcome Apple,Design in California, Assembled in INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳","Good Deal on prime day

Design in California, Assembled in INDIA🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳",5
2124,"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..

Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.

Sound & Call Quality also Network

Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!

Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.

Camera:
The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P

I would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!",3
2125,Defective products received,"The iPhone 11 delivered was defective and had spots on display which doesn't clear even after cleaning. Amazon app shows 10 days return or replacement by Amazon. But, when contacted they push us to go to apple service center directly and doesn't provide any help.",1
2126,I want to return this phone,"i wish to return this product, as per your return policy within 10 days from delivery date, i have trying to many time, but there is appearing to contact apple, kindly return this phone , its a worthless phone , kindly resolve the same immediately",2
2127,WORST IPHONE EXPERIENCE EVER!,"This is the most unusual experience I ever had with an Apple product. I ordered the iPhone 11 Black, 128 GB, the top portion of the Touchscreen was not working at all. Further, got it replaced with another iPhone in the replacement. The second phone that arrived was also defective. The speakers of the phone were super defective. It was highly evident that the product is defective. Had no option but to return the product and buy the phone at a higher cost with Vijay sales. Appario Brand retailers are supposed to be the best in the business. But two defective iPhones in two days is surely an issue. Really bad experience with iPhone Products. Had to gift the phone to my dad on his birthday. Made my dad sad. No Electronics products for me from Amazon now.",1
2128,The best iPhone - perfect combination of features!,"This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.

-----------------------************------------------------

Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:

1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).

2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.

3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.

4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.

5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.

6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).

7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.

------------------------***********-----------------------

Cons:

1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.

2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.

3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.

4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).

5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.

6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.

--------------------************----------------------

Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.

Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.",5
2129,Never buy Costly items from online seller,"It's a really bad buying experience from Amazon as they are not giving Amazon pay cashback as stated by their offer. Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting finer details of terms and conditions during the offer in so many places that it’s impossible to take screenshots of complete offer and it’s serve the purpose for amazon tactically as you cant have all details handy with you when you will complain with their customer care regarding not receiving the cashback. usually cashback come to the customer account only after sales end, So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.

Soon it seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.

BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images taken from the iPhone is no doubt is best in the segment and hard for any phone to match that. But as per my experience It's better to buy it offline after checking it personally, spending few thousand bucks makes much more sense rather risking much larger amount. I am lucky phone comes out as original but I have heard about many fraud cases from both Amazon and Flipkart. So choose wisely",1
2130,Perfect Delivery by Amazon!,"Everything about this phone is amazing!
And Amazon’s delivery is glitch-free. Order without a care!
Received a perfectly sealed box, and inside was this beauty.
Anyone looking for an upgrade from the iPhone6/7/8 should definitely consider this cause this phone is leagues ahead. No Lag whatsoever. Amazing Processing Power.
The Camera Quality is amongst the best so far.
Low Light Pictures take some time.
Battery- A full charge lasts more than a day’s use with moderate usage.",5
2131,Feeling cheated,"I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don’t know what Apple is going to do.
In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.",1

2133,Ringtone and sound problem...,"Today finally I got my iPhone 11, but it doesn't go well as expected, the ringtone volume goes off as it rings, not audible and even while on phone(on conversation) it needs Loudspeaker on to make the sound audible. I am going to return this iPhone to the Amazon and i suggest you friend don't buy this phone as most of iphones have some or less problems.",1
2134,One trillion operations per second,"Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life. This phone is a must buy!",5
2135,Switched From Samsung Note 9 ( Adequately Satisfied ),"Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.
A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.
Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.
There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.
Videos are Super Stable ++.
Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.
IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.
Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.
5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.
Built quality solid.
Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.
Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)
Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.
And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!
All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.",5
2136,A honest review of an android user,"Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it .

Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it",5

Pros:
- Great battery life: My usage is mainly calls, mails, WhatsApp, podcasts, web browsing and social media
- Satisfied with Apple’s claims about security and privacy
- Works great within the apple ecosystem. Already have an iPad and AirPods and connections are seamless across products
- Great for work and productivity
- Siri Shortcuts is great for creating workflows
Cons:
- Not great for media consumption. Screen resolution is a little over 720p
- Camera is great. But as of now I haven’t been able to use it to click better photos than I did on my previous phone (OnePlus 7). I don’t know, Maybe I’m using the camera wrong :P
- Had to buy the charger separately :(
- Lacks notification control to the extent that I want. In android I could have rules for different notifications within the same app, not possible here

Had bought it out of peer pressure to be honest...So I’m having mixed feelings about it.",4

2146,Never go for Expensive Product from amazon.Worst Amazon Service.. Iphone 11 getting heated...,"I ordered iphone 11 64GB red on 16th octomber Great Indian Festival and got delivery on 18th octomber. after unboxing iphone switch on the device .try to capture some images and video the iphone backpanel is getting heated.on normal use like watching videos getting heated ,even i havent install any appilcation on device.after contacting with apple support care they advice to upgrade OS version (from 13.7 to 14.0.1) but issue same . I ask to amazon for replacement or return ..but they saying that they dont have authority to replace/refund you have to go for service centre.if they dont have authority to replace/refund why they selling apple product.its just only 1 day after purchased and i had raised the issue even they have the 7 day replacement policy.So dont go on amazon for expensive product..think 100 times while buying..",1
2147,A detailed review,"After 3 months of usage, It feels smooth and it’s the first time I’ve used an IOS device. Following are few points describing the product.
1) Screen and display:
The screen is quite comfortable to look at and the adaptive display works excellent. The transition from one app to another is so smooth and satisfying. The display adapts according to lighting and quite easy on the eyes. There’s blue light filter (true tone) which gives a warm hue to the display. Brightness when set to max is excellent even in day light.
2) Software:
Currently on IOS 14, the interface is to a next level. It took few days to adapt according to the interface but now, every app is smooth and easy to use.
The face unlock is so accurate as it uses infrared light and smart unlock. That means no one can unlock your phone while you’re asleep so your phone is secure. Also you can unlock your phone even in dim to dark lit rooms or in absolutely no external light. The phone has lot’s of shortcuts making your use super easy and quick. No doubt about the security! Each and every bit of data is safe on your device.
3) battery
As I’m not a heavy gamer, the battery is enough for an entire day or 2 at max. Switching from android to iOS i used battery of 6000mah which still is more than apple’s 3110mah but the ios battery management is really great. You can watch videos at max brightness for quite a long time on this plus if you’re a heavy gamer, you may have to charge the device maybe twice a day. Also the battery optimisation is an excellent feature which saves your device from overcharging.
4) camera
Well it’s iphone baby! Camera is excellent and most clear pictures and videos are captured from the camera. A 10/10 for camera and videos. If you’re into making content for YouTube or instagram, this phone’s camera would be perfect. Also the pictures captured are quite vivid.
Few cons of the device
1) The notch takes up little more space of the screen. I personally don’t find it annoying but few people may.
2) Phone may heat a little during charging.
3) If you bought this after selling your kidney, you must stay hydrated. Be very careful with your phone as even a little scratch would hurt your heart a lot.",5
2148,Iphone vs One plus,"Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucks
Camera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the best
Face recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.
Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.
Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phones
Build quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.
No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.
Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?
P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.",4
2149,Perfect switch from OnePlus || Original Phone,"After 5 years of loyalty towards OnePlus and 8years towards Android, Finally moved to an IPhone after all the intense brainstorming and research and the obvious Skepticism around different news floating around questioning its authenticity.
For me, the seller was Darshita Electronics (All my 8phones to date has come from this seller and all of them were 100% genuine.

About Iphone 11 128GB White, neatly packaged and delivered,
To do's to check if the phone is Original,
1. Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing
2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)
3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei
4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy
5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock
6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides
7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaults

What did I like about this phone?
1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)
2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features
3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""
4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones
5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)
6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective
7. Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online store

What is not present but doesn't make difference?
1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least
2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS15
3. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging
4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fine

Recommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.",5
2150,Charger given low volts and received bank offers cash back after multiple chase,"I purchased iPhone 11 on sale day and I thought that I received defective phone. After phone got full battery drain. I kept on charging with timer clock, it took more than 3 hours exactly. I doubt now I received genuine product from amazon. Thy told need switch to fast charger.
Bonus Cash back not received.. later multiple chase got cash back finally, I’m happy and phone is awesome !",1
2151,Phone 5 stars Seller 0 stars,"The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didn’t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and won’t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care can’t connect with a person and their automated options doesn’t cover my concern.
Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.",5
2152,Avoid iphone 11,Avoid iphone 11. Save your money. I feel its better to wait for the next iphone or get yourself another phone altogether. Apple’s standards are dropping year by year. But the price is instead rising over the roof with bad products,3
2153,Pathetic service for a poor product,"My device is under warranty and has Bluetooth hardware issues . Service center in Chennai saying it will take three weeks for them to fix it and no stand by device is with them . Apple customer cate is not able to arrange one -even after multiple calls . Customer care is asking me to contact other service center in Chennai myself . Service center saying talk to customer care .
Bought a premium product only to be disowned by both seller-Amazon and the product brand - Apple
No responsibility accountability and self respect clowns
Oh yeah ... we know what happens in Apple manufacturing facility in Karnataka - just saying",1

Apple care has provided the case ID to check with Amazon. But the Amazon colleagues have not supported to proceed with replacement or refund.

2156,I just love iPhone 11 !!!,"The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.

Pros -

- Camera is Amazing
- Water-resistant

- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming
- And 100s of more Pros

Cons -

So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device.",5
2157,Product is useless without required accessories.,"Worst policy ever. Product has come with only usb cable without adopter and earphones.Is it making any sense? Even initial charging can’t be done, how could you rate the product????? This is truly cheating the customer, which shouldn’t be entertained. Humble request, please do not cheat your customers who trust you and without seeing the product they do pay for it. Please include all required accessories and display the price. DO NOT DECEIVE!!!",1
2158,Display issue. And customer support was not helpful.,Received a defective display product. And now after lots of follow-ups amazon asks me to return the product. Where as I am looking for replacement. But they're not willing to help. They say the product is not in stock.,1
2159,Got genuine product from Amazon. Value for money in this price segment.,"I got received fresh box packing and manufacturing nov month. I heard many rumors for fake iphone delivered from Amazon. But i don't think they do this cheap work. So without hesitate u can place order from Amazon. I have used some days this product then i feel on hand its awesome. I have listened music earphones and stereo speakers. Very loudly sound and every beats are crisp and clear.
Camera quality are awesome no doubt. Display quality is decent and battery life is also decent. Approx 1 day uses with normal uses. Face id is more secure. But i got face one issue. In this Pandemic, the mask has to come down again and again whenever the phone has to be unlocked. So they should give In fingerprint displays. This is safe feature in this pandemic.
Along with the phone, they should also provide a charger. Because you take so much money, you still cannot provide charger, even that big company!
Overall the phone is good, you can buy.",4
2160,Premium phone with okay discounts from HDFC.,"Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.
Pros:
1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.
2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?

Cons:
1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.
2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.
3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.
4. Read the terms and conditions of
Apple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance.",5
2161,Damage Product Received,I received a damaged product with scratches all over,1
2162,I love this device...❤️❤️❤️❤️,"AppleApple says the iPhone 11 will last for an hour longer on its battery than the iPhone XR, which already got tremendous battery life. But the only hard battery life numbers Apple publishes now are fixed tests of single actions, like video and audio playback on a loop. That’s not how anyone really uses a phone, and Apple’s claims of improved battery life over the previous phone aren’t really based on those tests. Instead, the company takes a huge dataset of real-world iPhone usage and runs it against a model of the new phone that accounts for the various processor, chipset, display, and OS power improvements and the larger battery capacity",5
2163,Pubg Gamer's review😁,"There is no android phone in the market which could compete this beast. Undoubtedly best for Pubg if you taking this for game or youtubing go for it......if not i think you should switch to oneplus varient.....best thing about this phone is its privacy and gaming screen recorder its just unbelievable.....only cons (charging process is very slowwwwwww it takes 3hrs for 5w charger, 2hrs for 12w charger and 1.5hrs for 18w charger) NO FAST CHARGING the only reason for 4 star😉😉😉",4
2164,iPhone 11 yellow tint screen,Guys I have learned that there are two types of screen display color in iPhone 11. One is with yellow tint and other one is blue tint. And my phone which I got from amazon is yellow tint which is very low in brightness. Blue tint is good and brighter. Do not purchase yellow tint phones. Not happy with amazon service as they are not exchanging to blue tint.,1
2165,"Not good, feels similar to android phones in 20-25 K category","if you are an android user, you will have many letdowns. first and formost home button, back button, close all options. camera does not seem out of the world compared to other android phones 20K range. you will have to loose whatsapp chat completely, lot many features for users which are simple in android are either not there or you have to learn to use it in a different way.

in summary if you are a decade old android user, you will not be comfortable",2
2166,Bad quality unit given,"I don’t think the quality of phone is good. Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store.
The phone hangs few times everyday. Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well. Didn’t hear all this from a friend who is using iPhone11 too. Must be a refurbished or low quality phone beng sold here.",2
2167,iOS users gotta accept it’s iPhone 11.,"Nothing to dislike about the product and seller.

Security: I only hope that apple will come up with an iOS update to add option for those wanting to disable swipe after the phone is unlocked with Face ID.

Camera quality: Could see visible grains in photos taken even during daylight as compared to the photos taken from iPhone 5s even though it’s without crisp details. iPhone 11 boasts of camera features, else the picture quality isn’t impressive. Video quality is good though.

Battery: It’s not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly. So, it will go about an entire day in moderate usage without much to play.

Voice assistant: Siri is few seconds slower to respond to ‘Hey Siri.’

Sound: Sounds good while watching videos. Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom. Use EarPods/AirPods for the better.

Overall, it’s a good buy in 2020 with not much to bargain for what you pay.",5
2168,Almost good phone,"Excellent phone so far. Bought it for more secure access. Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).

On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy. Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.

I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing",4
2169,Prestigious and worthy which I needed.,"An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.
During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am. And also got it same at my residance with very speedily on 18th in safe n superb packing.
But after inserting sim card i hv noticed that incoming call ringer volume was not working, i hv contacted APPLE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TEAM, they tried to resolve the problem, through screen sharing, they hv tried, there level the best, but couldn't get successed and saying that this is product manufacturing defect and advised to contact apple service centre, with sending me a (service centre) link, which was 400km away from my residence.i explained my inability to opt it, hence he advised to contact AMAZON from which it was purchased .

Then i hv contacted AMAZONE, customer service centre, described all these, then via via via an authorised executive talked with me, explaining all the details and requested to help me out. He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards. I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period i hv purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)
Otherwise I could purchased iphone 11 from apple store, it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.
After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)
Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a cutomer of AMAZONE.
If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not be possible for replacement.
Salute to AMAZONE. I AM HIGHLY OBLIGED.

2172,iPhone 11 review,"iPhone11 Review
A person who uses every major application of a phone such as a camera, notes, gaming, binge-watching, and also wants his phone to run smoothly for at least 3-5 years may go for iPhone11. According to my experience, I would suggest the iPhone11 as the best choice because I’ve been using Android for the last 5 years and the issue which I was facing with my phone was, it started to hang within 2-3 years of its purchase. It also began to overheat if I would continuously use its activities such as watching videos or playing games. Besides, the major issue with an android phone is privacy. It requires that data on mobile devices has to be transmitted to Google servers, which is used for targeted advertising. This makes Android a less private mobile operating system. I remember that whenever I used to search for a product on the Amazon app, my phone was flooded with ads of the searched product. So, to get rid of all of the above issues I thought to give a try to the iOS operating system instead of buying another Android phone. Apple is committed to its customer privacy, and their phones also come with a powerful CPU(Central Processing Unit) which makes them compatible to do with multitasking for a long duration without facing any problem. Among all the iPhone models, I found iPhone11 budget-friendly. Being the latest model it covered various shortcomings of old models. It has better performance, great durability, a dual-camera system, and many other features.
One of the most important reasons why I chose the iPhone11 over former iPhones is that it comes with an A13 Bionic chip and is the fastest CPU ever in a smartphone which falls under the price range of this phone. With this powerful beast, I can perform various multitasking without experiencing any lag. It also has the best GPU(Graphical Processing Unit) which allows you to watch videos at their highest graphics. I remember when I used to play games on my old phone it suddenly stop but now my experience with the new iPhone11 in terms of gaming is amazing, the whole game runs smoothly without any frame drop. However, I would not recommend gaming on iPhone11 for a long time because it starts to overheat. Additionally, its iOS 14 update is the best update I have ever seen on any smartphone. One of my favorite features in this update is ‘picture in Picture’ in which I can continue to watch a video or make a FaceTime while we are using another app. Such type of amazing applications help me to provide the best possible performance especially when I use my phone for multitasking.
Apple claims that they had used the toughest glass on the back and in front in iPhone11 and its aluminum case provides extra durability to it. Apart from this it also comes IP68 rating which means it is fit enough to withstand dust, dirt, and is resistant to submersion up to a maximum depth of 1.5m underwater. I had also seen many youtube videos in which people do the toughest test on iPhone11 such as they make it sink in the water for an elongated time and when they take it out it works completely the same as it was before. Such waterproofing makes it possible to take underwater pictures and videos which are pretty amazing.
Iphones are already quite famous for their camera quality but it becomes even better with iPhone11. iPhone11 comes with an amazing dual-camera system which means that now users have a choice to shoot photos or videos in wide and ultra-wide mode. It also comes with stereoscopic depth which allows taking portraits of all the objects. It is one of the major changes that the iPhone has undertaken because, in earlier iPhones, users were able to take a portrait of the human face only. It also comes with night vision mode which helps to capture the photos in dim light places which is a very useful feature for me because as compared to my earlier phone there was no such option to do the same. It can be used for a variety of different hobbies such as if you are a vlogger you can use it to shoot videos in 4k and if you are an amateur photographer you can use it to capture the finest photo which can ever be taken on a smartphone.
Along with that one of the crucial features that I like about the iPhone is its astonishing “continuity feature” that makes it seamless to connect all the Apple devices altogether. for example, through this feature, we can make cellular calls with any of the Apple devices which are connected to your iPhone.As I am also looking forward to buy a Macbook, this feature will help me a lot in completing my college assignments as with the help of this feature I can use my iPhone to scan documents or take a picture and have it appear instantly on my Mac, and Apple continues to add such type of incredible and unique features that can make your work easier.
Being a college student I accept that Rs.72,0000 price tag seemed to be a little steepy but, my experience with this phone has proven it to be worth the cost. After years of purchasing random phones that promised me to provide the best experience in terms of durability, performance, camera quality it is the iPhone11 which finally delivered such claims. I personally recommend you to buy this complete package of the newest technology presently available.",4
2173,Very bad experience,I received a defective product. Exchange and return is also not easy. We need to contact Apple and get back to Amazon. Please think before buying. Badly disappointed ! Didn't expect this from Amazon. I wasted my money here,1
2174,Great phone with low quality screen and heating issues,"Gets heated up while playing heavy games, and even if kept on full brightness for more than 30 mins.
You’ll also notice the low quality of the screen while watching videos on youtube
otherwise it’s a great phone, been using esim (Jio) + physical sim (Vodafone) , works flawlessly",5
2175,Refurbished/Demo phone shipped- yet no replacement,"Used device.. though by look and feel it felt like a brand ,new untampered phone…once i tried setting up a new apple id,i got the shock..this device was already used before to create multiple apple ids. I contacted Apple customer care and they confirmed that the device was used before to create other apple ids. They said this error comes only if the phone is refurbished or used as a demo phone.
Also i would like to highlight, amazon and apple have a tie up and if you need to replace a iphone purchased from amazon,you have to go to their store physically and get a job sheet from apple. In my case, when i approached apple for the job sheet they deleted the phone’s history from their end and said that there wasnt any issue with the phone. the previous error(screenshot) vanished and i could successfully create a new id with that phone.
Overall disappointed not just with Amazon but also Apple..#sabkimilijhulibhagat #cheated #untrustworthy",1
2176,Pathetic Amazon’s customer service,"I bought it during the sale, and as per the offer a caahback of rs1250 was to be credited in my Amazon pay account, I have called their service centre many times, initially they used to tell me that it would be credited in next 48 hours, now after waiting for my cashback for several days I got to know by their service centre that I am not eligible for the cashback. Pathetic Amazon.",1
2177,Amazon sold modified product to me,"Amazon has sold a modified product to me. And now the handset is issues that Apple says can't be rectified even under warranty because the product is modified. Amazon says it has been done at the customer end. However I have never taken my phone to a local vendor for any service. We have always visited Apple service centre at gurugram. Neither Apple nor Amazon is ready to help me as a customer now. Who's fault is it. No one is taking the responsibility or ownership. Low grade, modified products being sold by Amazon. Heart breaking.",1
2178,Issues while updating,"My phone had issues during updating / restoring from iOS 13 to iOS 14. Tried updating it multiple times with restore mode and it worked after 4-5tries. Today I tried updating from iOS 14 to iOS 14.1 and I am getting same issue. Update gets stuck at waiting for iPhone or verifying update with iPhone. Tried with multiple cables/networks/computers, but no use. Will try my best again to update it, if it doesn’t will try to return.",1
2179,Switching from Android to iOS/ Submitting review after 5 days,Switching from Android to iOS and everything is amazing people are saying that phone has heating issues but I didn’t find anything related heating. After 5 days of uses Im now big fan of Apple products. Don’t think about anything just buy that product you will never regret thanks,5
2180,Seller issue,"Disappointed with the seller. No earpods in the box. These sellers thinks people are dumb and will not read what they are paying for.

It is clearly mentioned in the description that phone will come with earpods and dash charger.

Replacement filed, hope will get what is mentioned.",1
2181,Good phone but though for first time Apple user,After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.,5
2182,"Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. Go for it.","Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.
Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.
When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly. Some other good features:
- Stereo speakers with great quality.
- iOS provides smooth user experience.
- The main camera produces very good photos, Night Mode works good.
- Amazing video quality
- Excellent selfie photos.
Overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase of mine.",5
2183,Nice,Nice,4
2184,Cellular service stopped after one year,"My iPhone 11 which I bought just over an year ago suddenly started showing No Service. I've not been able to make calls or messages for last 2 weeks. I had given all the details, diagnostics, logs and did everything that they asked me to do. They made me format my device and oh God backing up and restoring using their iTunes is a big challenge in itself. Despite doing everything, Apple hasn't given resolution. Think again before you buy this",1
2185,Fake display on orginal phone. Never buy.,"Never buy anything expensive like mobile phone from Amazon. I recieved the phone and god i couldnt have doubted a bit. Packed box, Everything brand new. After a few month i bought another iphone 11 from store and then just today i was comparing for fun. I noticed a massive difference between the display quality. The brightness. The color quality. How could hav anyone detected this. Its a fake display on a new phone. Never going to buy anything from Amazon. Cheats, Theives! will file a complaint in consumer court if this is not sorted. I paid real money to get a phone with copy display?",1
2186,Good phone hopefull that it will last long,"Worth the cost.
Battery life is good. After 40hrs of moderate use 35% of battery was still remaining.
The usage was with location,Bluetooth ,mobile data turned off ,wifi on and display brightness set for the lowest possible for viewing clearly.
Display , touch, faceid is good. Face id doesn unlock if eyes are closed.
Camera clarity is too good along with night mode.
Adapter in the box is not satisfactory. I have a fast charge capable power bank and charge my iphone by using power bank. So 30 to 100 % charge happens in about 1hr.",5
2187,Giving slight current on camera,"The phone got delivered on 19 jan 2020 and I am facing current problem on camera side, it is giving slight current.
It’s been 6 month can I return the product ?
Very much disappointed suddenly sound drops and get into silent mode...
this product is not at all good portrait mode is worst in camera",1
2188,Horrible product,"Had bought this phone 1 day ago and it already started heating up a lot and started getting discharged really often
Pls do not buy such expensive products from amazon",2
2189,Screen waste,After 20 days of usage some black spots appeared on the screen. Then I took it to iphone service center they did some tests and said this black spot has been appeared due to pressure damage. And also they said it will spread and this will not cover under my warranty. After some days the black started to disappear and screen starting flickering. If the damage happened because of pressure damage the black spot should not have disappeared. I have spoken to iphone center they are not giving proper response. My suggestion is not to buy iphone it just waste of money. Even manufacturing defect also they are not covering under warranty. Iphone simply waste of money.,1
2190,Amazing Phone and Superb delivery By Amazon and the seller,"First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.

Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.
The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.
2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.
The Battery backup is decent.
The Sound Quality is nice.
Face recognition is really fast.
Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.
Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.
Hope this helps ! ✌🏼",5

2195,Appario seller delievered me dupliacte product.,I bought it from Appario. This is the first time i am unsatified with AMAZON. Particulary after spending lots of bucks i could expect bettery quality phone. But this guys delivered me defective product. I have taken 100 plus photos and i could clearly see the difference. The photos are not even competing with iphone 6s and samsung a50. I am sure this is not apple branded product. some dupliacte product. Amazon please dont encourage these type of sellers.,1
2196,Good and genuine product by Amazon,"Great discount purchased during offer. Earphone and charger included along with data cable. Secure delivery. Packaging was not good but iPhone cover itself is rock hard which can protect the inside item very well. Camera quality is awesome, Night mode even better, Great look, mine is purple, suits both gender. Super speed function, face unlock very sensitive, front camera very good. Only 1 physical sim can be supported, and another e-sim can be installed if required. Battery life not as expected, I used to charge atleast once every day. No screen guard included. Many free android apps are not free in ios.",5
2197,Detailed Review// Unexpected 😲,"First of all a very big thank you to Amazon great Indian sale as I bought this device for 46,249 and I really did not expect that I would get iPhone 11 at this price I’m truly very happy that I could wait all this long to buy a new phone. Eventually I never thought that I would be an Apple fan as I was a big time android user for 10 years.
Well I was about to buy one +8 pro and I was quite confused whether should I go with one +8 pro or iPhone 11. I compared both the phones and eventually I decided to go with iPhone 11 as one +8 pro camera is really not up to the mark for what we actually pay in fact if I want to compare Samsung M series phones have better camera than one +8 pro. Other than camera one +8 pro is really a top notch phone in terms of display and sound quality.
No let’s talk about iPhone 11 and I am giving this review after 20 days of my usage & I am really a heavy user.
Camera as outstanding, top notch, till now and from past 10 years I have never seen a camera which is this amazing in terms of quality and shots infact night mode is extremely superb. The ultrawide camera is the best ultrawide camera which iPhone 11 gives and comparing iPhone 11 with one +8 pro it’s a shame even though one +8 pro gives a 48 megapixel camera it doesn’t give the best quality & filed of view.
Talking about performance trust me this has one of the powerful chipset if compared to snapdragon 865, Like really no other phone can beat it.
I don’t know what sampling rate iPhone 11 has but the display is amazingly smooth and silky; that touch response is a “WOW”
The face recognition is amazing!! more than my expectations because it really doesn’t work like what android system is, The privacy and security which iPhone offers is the best.
Now talking about battery life it is really good when it comes to a standby mode but when you actually keep using the phone continuously, it drains out and maximum time you can use is just 5 hours 35 minutes. And charging time with 5W charger takes more than 2 hours 30 minutes.
Talking about build quality it is good, stylish, superb but kind of heavy as it has the best glass on both sides infact on the first day itself it fell down from a height of 4 feet and I was surprised that it didn’t break.
Talking about gaming, trust me it heats a lot. I mean I have played PUBG at high graphics as well as Asphalt 9 and the back panel does heat up quickly and at some point you cannot even hold it.
So I would say, Buying an iPhone for gaming won’t be a good choice as it heats up a lot and playing continuously will definitely drain out the battery.

I was quite worried to buy an iPhone from Amazon because there were lot of negative reviews and few of them said that it’s a fraud and they have been cheated but luckily in my case; 🤞🏼I really got the original product, a genuine one and I didn’t face any issue in terms of packaging.",4
2198,Worth money!,Had preordered it arrived at the same day when it was officially out on retail store. Prompt delivery and with excellent packaging. Been using a few days and for me it’s an excellent upgrade from 7 to 11. Full review I will be dropping later after few days of regular usage. N I love the pastel green color 😊,5
2199,Fabulous,"So after reading 3-4 negative review I thought to not buy a premium phone on Amazon but I am seriously telling you not to consider these 3-4 negative review,so finally I ordered I phone 11 for my son and phone is doing great ,no problems are faced till now,and also I contacted amazon customer care executive they told me mam if you faced any problem call directly to us we will surely help you ,iam honestly telling you amazon is the best online shopping flatform ,they treat you like a family member , so overwhelming thank you amazon",5
2200,iOS not only need update but need lot of improvements,"So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.
Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.
Hope with new release they will match with android.
Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don’t even think of it.",1
2201,"Brilliant , but wait...","Amazon and appario retail did a good job.
I received a apple factory sealed package.

But I found that the front glass was scratched mildly, running throughout the glass... That was disappointing since this is a factory sealed package , and it's the fault of apple. So Im taking to apple service.

Other than that, one can save money by buying 11 instead of having a 12, also 11 has benefits of bigger battery, some what same performance and software, nearly identical camera. But Major difference is 5G and design.",4
2202,Avoid all PAID NEGATIVE REVIEW,I was very much worried when I ordered this phone from Amazon sale cuz of so many negative reviews n grabbed it in 44k around. When I unboxed it and check warranty along with every possible detail I found it to be a superb phone at a jaw dropping price. My phone has no heating issue or camera issue or whatever issue these guys have mentioned in reviews. All over a great deal. Just go for it blindly as it’s still cheaper than what u get in offline store.,5
2203,Total waste of money,"There is always WiFi problem. Its WiFi signal catching ability is very low and unstatic. Therefore, it is useless for me. Apple authorized service centre, without checking my phone, told me that every WiFi connection has its own strength. My WiFi works good in my OnePlus 7 Pro. I had complained it on the very 1st day of its delivery to me. Amazon asked me to visit Apple Authorized Service Centre. But there is no help either from Amazon or Apple Authorized Service Centre. It is also slow as compared to my OnePlus 7 Pro.",1
2204,CHARGER EARPLUG MISSING,"Unfortunately charger and ear plugs found missing in the package.
Customer care fails to compensate in this regard.

Worst purchase I have ever seen",1
2205,Time to move to iOS,Me a ten year android user finally switched to iOS and this was a deal which couldn’t be refused. About iPhone everything is great. Just two cons comparatively less battery back up if you coming from 5000/6000mAH android phones and screen has a bit of yellow tint but it can be resolved from settings. So overall 8.5/10 for the phone.,5
2206,Amazon quality is poorest.,Received a defective piece. There’s no option to replace. Apple store is 250kms away from my address.,1
2207,Loving it!,"I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.
Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.
After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.
Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.
Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.
Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.
Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.",5
2208,This phone is only fulfill ur desire that u hving an iphone,Of course u r purchase a I phone but when u purchase phone on this cost they should give airpods....m expecting the pods but again having wired earphones .it means I spent again money for buying airpods...that is not fair with customers..but another side when u have the it's nice....nice phone,5
2209,Super🤩🤩,"Finally got ""iphone"".Great from Amazon great india sales.Battery life apple phone is given 3100mAH but it works equally with the android 6,000mAH easily lasts one day.And all are well known about quality of iPhones even its 12mp.Phone feels little bit wider than normal phones.",5
2210,Dont even think of buying smart phones from the Amazon,"I am giving this feed back after using 6months
Iphones are not worth buying from ""Amazon"" they will send you refurbished mobiles or damaged products i dont use much even thouh my battery health decreased to 94% if you want to buy any smartphones please go to retailers offline never ever think of buying through ""AMAZON""
""COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY NOT THAT WORTHY""",1
2211,Cheating by Amazon - Dont believe in Bonus or discounts of offers by Amazon,"I have booked Iphone 11 during the sale on 16th October and there is cash back offer in amazon of Rs.1250 and its clearly written that cashback will receive as amazon pay within 3 working days after shipping.
I have not got it still the cashback. Even after calling to customer care, there is no response and i've not got the cash back amount.
This is really worst thing from amazon on cheating customer by showing discounts/offers/deals.",1
2212,Bad quality of customer service and support,"Dear Amazon Support/Customer Care,

This ls to write and bring to your notice regarding the extremely bad quality of product and support provided by Amazon.

To brief you about the situation, I bought an apple iphone-11 from Amazon and not from any other platform because of the trust on Amazon and it's great support team. But this time around, it was a completely opposite situation. After receiving the product on 30.10.2020, the product was discolored ( like damage); I immediately tried to replace the product through the options available on the app, but the app would just direct me back to the link of apple support website and contact number. After several tries, I final got through the apple support, only to be redirected to the apple store. On reaching the apple Stores during the limited stringent work hours, I was asked to come the next day. On the next day, I was informed that this issue needs to be taken up by Amazon only.

After being extremely tired of this entire long process, with great difficulty, I could connect with the Amazon customer support. The customer support assured me of resolving the issue and asked me to wait for 24 hours to get a call.

Post this, it has already been more than 40 hours and I m yet to receive any call. Furthermore, when I am trying to call the same number, I fail to connect despite repeated tries. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of your product and support; which is least expected from Amazon.

Today being my last day of eligible replacement, I write to you with the Last hope of some relief.

I expect atleast this time around Amazon will help its long loyal customer, who is losing faith in the quality of Amazon.",1
2213,Not satisfied with the iPhone my first phone :(,"Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .
Overall not satisfied",2
2214,Not worth the mo WY spent,"There is no fingerprint reader. There is face reader.
1. Quality of face reader is not up to the mark. One’ll is’ s face reader is better
2. Long WhatsApp messages get truncated
3. The call log cannot store all calls. It stores only last 1000. Also, it does not consolidate the calls of a single caller.
4. Screen is good. Mine is functioning well with minute scratches after 10+ months of usage
5. Speaker phone volume is low
6. Ringtone volume is low. Missed so many calls if someone is on the move
7. No support on third party apps like WhatsApp, Facebook or Adobe",3
2215,Not the great camera ! Slow charging and useless 5 watt adapter,"Phone is perfect in all aspect just few things lacks
Battery charging is slow even if I’m charging with Huawei 18 watt charger
And 2nd camera I would this could be bcz I’m coming from pixel 3xl and if i have to compare in 10 I would give 10 to pixel even though it didn’t have ultra wide lens and this I would give 6 .
Only in 2 thing is got disappointed
1 battery charging and backup
2 camera
And make no mistake it QQUALCOMM quick charge so don’t go for suck Warp .vooc ,Dash , 65 waat and and such kind of charge bcz it only supports PD charge (power delivery) a charger which has out put USB C for example pixel charger and Samsung note 9 and above.",4
2216,Great Deal,"Ordered on 16th (Midnight) for ₹51.7k using the Offer on Great Indian Festival Sale. It arrived the Same Day the Following afternoon.

Excellent Deal and Delivery by Amazon.",5
2217,An Apple a day keeps Android away 😁😃,"Brilliant phone with fantastic features at an unbeatable price. To all those naysayers comparing Android with iOS, I have just one thing to say - Use iOS once and then we’ll see who comes out trumps. Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, iOS 14.1, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all. My Phone - iPhone🙂",5
2218,Love with my iPhone 11,"When I decided to upgrade my iPhone from 7 to iPhone 11, I browsed through in Amazon, I was shocked when I saw the review, there were quite a few bad reviews and I was so skeptical whether I should buy it from Amazon... it took me a week to decided and finally I thought let me take a risk. I purchased the phone and it was delivered to me the very next day. I opened the box with lots of doubts, but all my doubts turned into smile when I switched on my phone, it works brilliantly and I didn’t have any trouble.. the phone is amazing and I just love it.. I made the right choice. Only disappointment I had was the box doesn’t come with an charger adapter. Otherwise the phone is just amazing.",5
2219,Coming from Androids planning to stay.,"Been a few weeks since I got the phone, coming from a Galaxy S10, only reason I had to switch was giving my phone away to someone else in the family, and every other Androids gotten awfully boring decided to give iPhones a shot after a long time and I don't think I will be switching back any time soon. If you come from a similar android flagship there are a few things you need to get used to, in terms of the software its snappy not as fast as some androids but it feels smooth and has a flow to it.

Display is where you might get disappointed with but don't worry its not as bad as they say, its bright its got ample clarity and if you pixel peep you will see a few pixels here and there but nothing that will disappoint you but its brighter for some reason iOS has a very clean color palette which gives it a nice vibrant interface, watching video is alright but you will sure miss the deep blacks if you come from OLED but the dolby vision certification sure makes up for it.

Battery is downright impressive I can go through a whole day without putting it on charge and still finish with more than 40 percent juice left and I often get close to 9 hours average in screen on time as well I even left the phone unattended for 8 hours and it only drained one percent and still went through the whole day without a hiccup.

Camera is one of the best at what it does though Pixels and Galaxies might take slightly better pictures but if you use Instagram or Snapchat a lot this phone will do wonders for you miles ahead of any other android in terms of social media performance.

There is a certain heft to the phone the S10 feels like paper and walking or holding this phone feels like a chore if you also have one of those fat spigen cases on but you will get used to it. I will suggest you put a case on this bad boy as it does tend to get scuffed around the edges my friends iPhone had the same problem.

I dont have an Apple Ecosystem per se, but i got Airplay on my TV so I can stream my Apple Music library to it and play it over the sound system you can also do spotify.

For someone who is coming from Android since a long time this phone is the cake, absolutely delight to use small things do make a difference and also no auxiliary or usb c so carry around a spare lighting cable around with you and also charging by default is at 5 watts you could use a fast charger to get it upto 18, though I havent found the charging slow maybe because I dont use it while it does charge.

The notch is there but most of the action happens below it so its fine and you will start to ignore it after an hour.

PS: lot of negative reviews for the seller but what I got was a phone fresh from the factory in her wraps and only had one wifi calling glitch which was my fault apart from that the phones been absolutely stellar and Amazons been great delivering it in the pandemic too",5
2220,Mobile is getting heat while using,"The new iPhone mobile I purchased through Amazon getting heated while using the device for few minutes. Also noted the charges are getting extra hot.

So please contact the use urgently and replace the devise urgently (refer the delivery address and contact number from my order)",1
2221,IPhone 11 🔥,"This is my first time using iPhone
Pros
1. Camera is too much better than most of the smartphones with 48, 64 and 108 mp camera
2. Face ID works all the time even with lowest brightness of phone in full dark room
3. Surround Sound is excellent, it was soo pleasing
4. Battery backup is better it lasts almost a day on average using(No games)

Cons
1. Charging speed is too low, it takes about 3hrs to charge from 0 to 100
2.Display could have been slightly better, but still it's a better one
3. Heats up slightly on heavy usage

Delivered on time By Amazon, Happy with product and Amazon service as well.",5
2222,Waste of Money,Don't buy at all. Display is the worst display from Apple ever. Camera performance is cheap.,1
2223,Defect in accessories,I recieved not working accesories and amazon tell me to bring deny letter from amazon wow this is the seller concern such a bad service from amazon not worth to buy such expensive product from amazon i suggest not buy expensive products from amazon and from this typ of sellers too,1
2224,Fabulous phone,"Great phone with a very good camera and FaceId feature. The phone does not have a finger print reader. It was very easy to transfer information from my old phone. Just switch on the new phone, connect it to wifi, plug both the old and new phone to power and place them snear each other. Then start the transfer process. in approx. 30 minutes its all done. All the apps, photos, songs etc. get transferred directly for the old device to the new device. No need for backup and restore. Then transfer the SIM from your old phone to the new phone and you are all set. Seamless!!!",5
2225,iPhone love,"After reading the reviews I completely scared about the authenticity of the phone. I would like to thanks to all people who made me aware in such a way that Firstly I verified my phone before even putting the SIM card.
I got the brand new iPhone with no technical or physical glitches. Thanks to Amazon and apparition retail.
Phone is working flawlessly. Registered on Apple site and got warranty of one year.Rest of the features are already described.",5
2226,Degraded from oneplus8 to iPhone 11(experience based review),Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8. It feels like degradation for me from bigger and more clear display to small LCD with no refresh rate. Major pain area is battery charging from 15mins of oneplus to hours for iPhone. Feature rich shortcut in oneplus to static options like no shortcut for turning on or off location.,2
2227,Great value for iPad and MacBook users.,"The iPhone 11 is a good package. It is particularly great value for those who have invested in the Apple ecosystem, has bought apps from the App Store I have work flows that sync with iCloud.

As a researcher and writer I get access to softwares like Ulysses and Notability on my phone which is great.

Besides the phone covers all the essential basic features-a great camera, waterproofing, great battery life, cutting-edge haptic feedback, colour accurate and bright display good for reading indoor or outdoors.

I do not have anything to complain about the phone. I think it will be good for another four years at least.",5
2228,"Excellent battery, not so bad screen, slow charging, heavy phone","Pros -
1. All the benefits of an iPhone. (Superb ios experience, smoothness, speed, touchscreen etc etc etc)
2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage.
3. Sound is loud.

Cons:-
1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ₹1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you.
2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold.
Iphone x - 174 gms
Iphone xs - 177 gms
Iphone 11 - 193.3 gms
Iphone 12 - 162.4 gms",5
2229,Buy as you prefer,"Purchase this phone as I have been using iPhone for last 5 years now. For people who are planning to buy this phone assuming price has dropped recently let me aware you on few things. Please go through the description first. This product comes with iPhone and cable that’s all rest adapter against cable and earphone you need to purchase separately (3000/-). Additional cost which you anyways bears for any new phone on back screen guards, screen guard for 1500/- . So please add an additional value to 5k as well when you are purchasing this phone.😄",2
2230,Dissappointing hardware!,"I have been using 6s for past ~5yrs and made an economical swicth to Iphone 11, to stick to the simplified OS. For god sake, I could see so many cons in comparison with 6s, regretting my upgrade
1. Heavy!, expected, when I have switched from 6s, but its too heavy when compared to other phones of this size. May the same reason, ip12 is lighter
2. WIFI reception. ip6s did a very good job. almost at every part of my house, it was able to gather good signal. but ip11 literally struggles to even stay connected with WIFI at corners. it makes continuous switch between WIFI/cellular, annoys to to move to a different location. tried even with out the cover on.
3. Speakers at the bottom. I was thinking both the grill openings at the bottom were speakers. it turned out, i could hear music from only one of them. even i have planned to visit apple care to get the mobile checked. had some instinct to check it online before going, by then i was able find in apple discussions, that its microphone with speaker like grill.
4. Sound output - both through wired/wireless headphones. i could not hear anything in an crowded environment. even tried with multiple good earphones, the output is very low. this even a low end phone can do a better job. this might force me to move to a new phone may be.
And most imp is the call history, you cannot have more than 100 call records.. not sure, why apple have this policy. you gonna really miss some imp numbers, when we really get busy with continuous calls. And you cannot record your voice calls, when it’s really needed like in other ecosystem!
Feel, these are very basic setback to even consider it as a good phone. would definately not recommend anyone for ip11, rather would recommend ip12(if one can afford) or ip6s, if they could find in second hand market.(Yes, the size is small, but that does a better job). Even the former one, I'm not sure, as I haven't used hands-on.",2
2231,A premium device for a moderate user.,"I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.

I had iPhone 5s as my first phone. It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.

I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster. Will update the review after few months.

Build quality is remarkable.

IOS 14 is a magic.

Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.

Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.

I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision. Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.

Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.
If you are a photo person, this one is for you.

Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship, be ready for repeated charge cycles. 😅

This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.

Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.

Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.
Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.

Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍",5
2232,Disppointed as wrong description given,Phone is stylish and i am first time apple user .its look good and it would be too early to comment as i got the phone today only. I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least. I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later. Thank you,4
2233,Iphone 11😍,Bought this mobile in great Indian festival for 46k with all.possiblr discounts... I have seen few reviews and also youtubers videos that its a defective product or clone mobile... But I received genuine product with full warranty... E comm giant like amzon will not do fraud maybe some of there employees or delivery boys can do this type of things... Will this is my honest review ...I am not paid to review this nor I received anycashback offer for this review its just that I have seen so many reviews and videos so thought of sharing this...,4
2234,"Bad quality phone , bad supplier","Very sad, after five days , microphone for Siri , face time , IMO and WhatsApp stopped working. Was taken to I care , diagnosed that phone is having serious hardware issue, phone is send to Bangalore for further diagnosis .
Very bad supplier for such an expensive phone, I couldn’t use for more than five days.

Please beware of this supplier.",1
2235,Highly discouraged with the Apple performance,"I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.
please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.
I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...
i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...
Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...",3
2236,iPhone has Worst experience than Android.,"This is my first Apple phone. I moved to this in a hope of better phone than Android. This is the worst phone I have used till now.
Network
: It keeps on variating . Android is far better than this.
Music playback:
I connected to this my car and played music . Music comes as such I am playing on old tap recorder.music keep dragging.
Battery:
Battery just drine out in half with minimal usage.
Usability:
You hardly able to transfer data. These days WhatsApp is all. You can no way get your old phone WhatsApp data to new phone.

You will hardly get less than 50% applications.",1

M enjyng the best camera. Initialy m a oneplus user. Addicted to best cameras. Researchd alot to buy this iphone 11. Amazon prime gave me this iphone 128gb for 63k for whch i'm soo grateful to it. In love with this camera.",5
2238,Good purchase,"So, I bought it in Amazon sale just for 47,999/- so here is my one week usage review for you guys to decide you want this or not. So let’s talk about camera I would say bang on camera so good quality pictures in low light or in dark. In terms of performance phone nailed in that but only one problem I think I must include here is if you play PUBG or any heavy game like that phone heats not that much but it heats everyone is here complaining about heating problems trust me phone not heat while normal usage only when you play heavy graphics game like PUBG cod fort nite. So that’s all .",4
2239,Worlds no 1 phone,"I am writing this review after one week of my purchase from Amazon,Actually I was waiting for iPhone 12.but due to lots of delay information.i changed my mind to buy iPhone 11.And I am very happy with this phone.the Phone is amazing.but it takes almost three hour to full charge that makes me so disappointed.and lots of reviewer are saying about heating issue and they are also saying don’t buy from Amazon. But I didn’t got any issue like this.So I will say go for it without any second thought.100 percent Orginal product.Thanks Amazon thanks seller and thanks to delevery boy.thank you everyone.",5
2240,Like a Copy not Original,Front camera not good. Even both the camera front and back is not having that much quality. Picture is spread to the corners of selfie camera just like a ordinary phone. Heating problem is also persist if you use phone continuous of more than half an hour for any application such as YouTube listening music etc. I feel that Amazon provide customer first copy and not the original iPhone 11. Someone has to address this issue. Feeling is not good. I see the pictures captures by the front camera in google and seems very different than captured in my iPhone 11.,2
2241,Amazon selling defective phone in the name of discount,"Software is not working properly

I will strongly request people don't go for online shopping from Amazon.. they are attracting you in the name of discount but selling old and used phones",1
2242,Corrupted companies who loot customers with degraded quality phone.,"I have this LCD issue where yellowish shade constantly appears on my screen and it is a hardware issue. My iPhone has never been dropped, and or soaked in water. It was always good but after usage of 8 months I am facing this issue, if the sale was made on intention then the company must vanish here on. Also it is under 1 year warranty, I need to know who will bear this cost",1
2243,Received faulty product during Amazon Great Indian Festival; iPhone11 cosmetic patch,"Received iPhone 11 on monday. It showed a cosmetic patch( Oval patch) on the lower left corner of the phone on Tuesday morning. Took the phone to iCare centre on wednesday and they confirmed its a faulty product. Contacted Apple Customer Support, they asked to take the issue with Amazon and seller and get it replaced as the device is faulty. I have the service report and images which shows the condition of the display.",1
2244,This not a dual sim device only one sim works at once.,"Front camera quality in not good at all.
And dual sim doesn’t support in the phone.
This is not a dual sim device because only one sim works at once.

Like if u r call from primary sim then secondary sim becomes like no service.

And the same goes with the secondary sim

Even u can’t receive messages if u r on the call

If u received a call from unknown number on sim 2

And u want to call to that number from sim one that’s not gonna happen

For that u have to save that unknown number then only u will be able to call on that number",1
2245,Got it in a very good deal,"after watching so many bad reviews i was worried about the mobile it is fake or real?so many videos out on youtube also...but to be frank i received a very good and quality product its original not fake..i checked my i phone on apple site also by puttiing my serial number of mobile its verified by apple...received with charger ,cable and wired headphones...Very happy to buy this ..Thanx Amazon.",5
2246,Average phone!!!,"It’s just an ok phone with an Apple logo...
Otherwise features are average, charging this phone takes ages, this is my first IPhone and I am regretting it...one may buy oneplus etc for better features and experience",3
2247,pls provide charger & earpods,Chargers and airpods did not arrive with the phone Including charger and Airpods was written above the iPhone XI .I didn't have chargers and airpods,1
2248,Defective camera,"Going to lodge a consumer complaint.
Faulty camera: when I click picture near bright ligh notice the a faded object similar to tubelight and window in attached images. Defective product received and Amazon is not giving options to replace/return the product. When I placed return request it's giving me Apple customer care number to contact. :( The product packaging was also not safe the iPhone box was placed directly in the polythene bag, no other air cushion or cardboard was used. Really disappointed.",1
2249,It's an iPhone,"iPhone - the name is enough to guarantee buttery smooth performance, with years of guaranteed OS updates (Android, looking at you. I struggled to get the monthly updates for weeks on your own brand Pixel phones, forget about the flashy Samsung and Xiaomi/OnePlus etc.). Amazing camera, no bloatware or selling customer data to third parties (again Android, looking at you. You give the OS for free and make the customer the product to push ads for revenue). After years of being a committed Android user, from the time Nokia/Microsoft stopped making Windows smartphones, for almost 6+years, finally decided being taken for a ride by Google/Android. Well, was using the iPhone 6s for about an year along with my Google Pixel 2 XL, but now Apple iPhone is my only daily driver, and the way things are looking between Apple and Google and how they are focused on business in India, its going to be an iPhone always for me, for the foreseeable future.",5
2250,Worth the money. A Lag free experience!,"I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.

I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!

Pros:
1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor
2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal
3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud
4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!

Cons:
1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging
2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate
3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.",4
2251,DO NOT BUY FROM APPARIO Retail Sends defective products Camera not working defective item received,"Seller sent a defective peace on 1 day camera wasn’t working, tried and tired contacting Apple for appointments and running behind , Amazon doesn’t assist at all after period is over however this issue was raised on day 1",1
2252,It’s my black panther,"No comments on apple product
Pros:
1. Rich finishing
2. Awesome battery life .You will get two days for normal usage. For hard users it will be one day strongly
3. Marvellous photography using iPhone 11. Portrait mode is more attractive compare to previous versions. Wide angle camera Adds more attraction to the phone as well as more convenient while taking pictures.Night mode is awesome.
4.front camera is very nice
5.performance wise A13 chip never lags You in any instance.
6.Finally the brand value Apple Apple apple. I got this phone at the better price in 47999.",5
2253,Best value for money iphone,"Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performance
The only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.
If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money option
Display is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros.",4
2254,"Worst Experience, Received Defective Product","I have received a defective Product,When I switched it on I got some vertical lines displayed in center of the screen.I have tried to replace the product,But no response from Amazon , Simply says we need to contact Iphone Customer care.I don't know just received one day phone,I have to keep on spending my time to iphone customer care.This is a bad experience which I have ever got in Amazon. Amazon makes sure that should not be repeat this in future.Otherwise Amazon wil leads to drop their trust and customers in future.",1
2255,Got a defected phone from Amazon,I received a defected iPhone from amazon there is some space at the back glass it looks like a pasting and manufacturing issue please refund my money,1
2256,iPhone 11 best iPhone deal,"Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!
Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.
Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..

Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give “amazing user experience” then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..
Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.🤘.",5
2257,Microphone Not Working,"I am brought new iphone 11 ,but there is microphone it's not working and I am facing big problem, there is no any pick up service from the end of amzon and iphone and I am very disappointed of the service of both company.",1
2258,Superb. A wise a decision,"Superb. It’s a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don’t think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can’t multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?",5
2259,Over pricy but worth it,"I have always been an iPhone fanatic and it’s really worth it. I really would like to thank the seller and amazon delivering the product during covid 19 and that too before the mentioned delivery time.

The performance of the phone is amazing compared to any phone in the market. I love the facial rec and the camera quality a lot with different modes.

NOTE: I would suggest the seller to correct the bullet points or spec where it is mentioned that the phone come with AIRPODS.",4
2260,Worst experience with Amazon,"Phone is good but Amazon will flip what they have promised. I have not received My cash back, when I raised a complaint they told it will be credited to your account in 3 days, after 3 days also not received my cash back so again I have raised a complaint, they told same thing after 3days I’ll receive the cashback still not received. After 6 days now they are telling cash back options is not there for this phone, completely flip. Don’t no what is happening with them , I lost complete hope on them, I don’t have Any trust on them.",1
2261,Good buy and awesome product!!,Mobile device is good. Good upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected. I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn’t hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.,5
2262,"Overall, easily the best value for your money","Easily the best overall mobile phone for nearly two years now, and with good reason. Gifted a purple one to my mother. She was using a Oneplus X for a few years, and she loves the 11. The transition from android was smoother than expected. iOS and iPhone have come a long way from the days of iPhone 6.

Pros: that battery, that camera, iOS, Apple care.

Cons: are you kidding me?

OK, if I had to nitpick, the only annoying thing about iOS is having to use Garage Band to make my own ringtones from songs.
Otherwise, it's a pleasure to use this phone each time you pick it up.",4
2263,Defective Product Sold!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I shifted from Android to iOS thinking it would be a wonderful experience.....guess everyone gets a chance to be wrong.....Amazon sold me a defective product .........the phone shuts down and restarts randomly as per its whims and fancies....the Apple customer support was of not great help either .....they say the phone is fine... ...u need to get it checked at the service center.....so after spending almost 50k.... have no option but to run about to the service center to try and fix the issue.....Thanks Apple and Amazon for the Special Phone!!!!!!!!!,1
2264,iPhone vs Android = iPhone,"I thought may be not good as android but I felt better than android.
The user experience is good.
Even then also using android for 6years I never regretted about iPhone. All the necessary features are there in iPhone.
In terms of piracy iPhone is best.",5
2265,Originality of the product is doubtful,"I bought 128 gb white variant but the box rather received in sealed packed condition. Was received with normal polythene insealed way. It put me a strong doubt the originality of the product.
If you buy the same product from store it always comes with sealed packed polythene cover and thats not the case here.
Though the phone working fine now but not sure about rhe originality of external,internal parts.
One should note this serious point while buying anything from online.",3
2266,Worth for ur money,Buy whn u hav offer...I got cash discount of 6k for hdfc cc payment with no cost emi for 6 months plus last year I bought samsung m30 for 15k and got a exchange price of 6.1k...which s really good price....in total I just 50.5k with all discount..battery backup is good whn compare to all iphone models..red color is just awsome!!! 😍😍😍😍,5
2267,Use once and you will know why iOS feels premium :),In love with this amazing product!!!!,5
2268,My First Apple Product!,"After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.
It’s my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It’s camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don’t work with a mask.",5
2269,The best phone to get - A long term review of IPhone 11 64GB,"Here’s my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.
WiFi reception is Average I would say.
Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crisp
The speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love it
The display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurate
Battery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.
The phone is slippery so I use a back case.
Nothing more to say about i0S and it’s updates they are great",5
2270,Happy and satisfied,"I bought my iphone 11 64gb red variant from the seller Darshita Electronics. The product came in a bubble wrap, securely sealed. I cross checked if it was genuine by going to apple website and validating serial number details, and it was an authentic product given to me! Quite impressed with their fast delivery.
Regarding any further review, will have to use it and see...So far so good.",5
2271,Cheated,"I've been cheated for ₹60000/- for this product by Amazon by sending me a handset which had manufacturing fault. The fault was well pointed out by Apple's authorised service center. While contacting customer service on numerous occasions they made to wait for more tha a month and after a month they said 'sorry sir, we can't help you'. Handset is useles lying in my cupboard.",1
2272,Not recommend to purchase on Amazon,"Display issue :Having yellow tilt on screen .
I have compared with another iPhone 11 and found the difference.
My iPhone XR has better display.
Serial no and ime1 no is mismatching with no’s given in invoice
Note: Don’t buy iPhones on Amazon.",1
2273,Order It & Experience : Anything below 3 stars is fake/biased/dubious/hypothesis,"Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :

Positives:
Price Point : Brought this at ₹46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.
Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chip
Secure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.
Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editing
Gaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.
Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.

What i Dislike:
Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ₹68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ₹23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:",5
2274,Good phone if you are looking for long term,I was looking for a phone which is fast while opening phone and message apps and in general. Phones under 30k had performance issues. In 50k range Samsung and Oneplus were Android choices. But I did not like their software experience even after spending that much. My wife is using iphone7 for last 3 years and till this date it feels fast so I went ahead with iphone 11 and it is a solid phone overall.,5
2275,Simply AMAZING!!!,"Very much satisfied about the purchase. Was a little concerned about whether I would be getting genuine product or not, but kudos to the seller (Darshita electronics), they kept my trust. Got a September manufactured made in India unit as well. Every accessory working fine and no heating issues as well. Only heats up a little with my 20 Watts fast charger. I would recommend not to use the fast charger on daily basis. It’s okay to use it sometimes when you are in a hurry. Otherwise use the regular 5 Watts slow charger. Apple has provided that because of a reason. Only concern is with apple not amazon, which is the cable quality. Very very poor quality which starts to chip off within a few months. So due to sale, i ordered the Belkin cable for charging as it is best in class and MFI certified. Would recommend to use only good quality MFI cables if you want long life for your phone. Other than that, camera quality is top notch and always seems to improve with every software update. Battery life is epic, lasts a full day although I don’t do gaming on iphone, still I am quite a heavy user.
Very very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon and Darshita electronics. ☺️",5
2276,Iphone vs Android experience,"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.

I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.

This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.

Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)

Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)

Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)",3
2277,Mobile heating too much,"I was facing heating problem initially but was believe on Apple service center and When I visited to apple service center they told me that due to summer it is heating even they are testing under AC and told me that our system is now showing that's why we can't replace the iPhone even it is heating too much and they felt it. ha ha ha So total depend on the Apple system, not on human feeling.",2
2278,I phone stuck at software installation,"Phone is stuck since last night over her
Cant go further
I received this i phone 11 yesterday
It is not working properly
I guess i got delivered a faulty product
Not happy😡",1
2279,Love it!!!,"I bought the iPhone 11 128gb white and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.
The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.
Pros:
Battery
Camera
Display
Processor

Cons:
The charger provided is only of 5W.

Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).
So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here.",5
2280,Much better than my expectation,"I’m writing this after one month of using it.
Battery 5/5 - so far the best I have seen on a phone both android or ios
Camera: 4.5/5 - honestly this is the best camera out of all iPhone till 11 (excluding the pro models). One thing which I was expecting was to control shutter speed atleast in the night mode settings it only gives me pre defined options.
Display: 4/5 even though you wont be able to see individual pixels, still would have been a tad better it the pixel density was little more atleast better than xr
Performance: 5/5 No doubt every iphone release breaks the previous record",5
2281,Good phone indeed but lil heating issue that’s all...,"Lil heating issue when u ran to many apps in the background or apps which single handedly use Lots of GPU eg. graphic intensive games or any apps!!! Keep in mind eventually u will come to know don’t worry! and it also hits up when u charge the phone n use them..... So here is some solution....don’t charge n use ur phone unless u necessarily needs it, avoid using back cover if it causes to much heat just remove it for the timing or close the running background apps/ games or switch off ur phone n on again....This are small tips it helped me!!!!....Thankyou guys for reading...if any questions let me will be ready to help u any time and also if we use the same phone cheers🍻🍻 email:-kishekaachumi.ka@gmail.com📩",5

Awesome camara solomo video

Till today don't find any con in the phone

It is really awesome
Ignore negative reviews
It's all a very good buy 👌🏻👌🏻",5
2283,Defective Phone delivered,"Hi,
Just got the iPhone 11 delivered, the speakers are damaged and the sound coming is all shaky and cracked.
Really horrible and disappointing to have Apple product provide such a poor customer and product experience. Please refund my money",1
2284,Go for it! Good job by Appario Seller!,"I was scared about the originality of the product. I’ve conducted all the necessary checks to identify if the product is original. It is absolutely a original one. Alternatively, I walked in to the Aptronix store and took their help to get a confirmation about product Authenticity. It is confirmed - an original iPhone 11 by Apple and the seller Appario.

Hope I’ll have a good time with my new iPhone 11.",5
2285,Camera issue in iPhone,"Camera was not working properly there was a lot of noise in indoor photos .The seller here appario rtl LTD is having issues with the phone I don't whether they are selling authentic phones .I got it replaced ,but the replacement unit also had same problem ,so just got it refunded. Think 1000 times before buying from Appario LTD seller.",2
2286,High price low feature phone.,"Its my mistake that I bought this iPhone again. My last 6s phone was also a worst phone I had to sold it after a year because there was many issues like hanging, battery backup. Visited Apple service center three times but nothing. Now my Apple 11.. weak network issue have to restart again and again, some time hanged. Less features less apps. High price low features. Just a standard symbol.",1
2287,amazing phone brand new,ordered this product on amazon big billion day sale. the product packaging was very good and the product is 100 percent genuine as one can see on apple id when the product got registered and got full 1 year warranty. the phone is very fst and the software experience is very fluid. got this phoneat rs 44k. the best deal i can get on iphone. one looking to purchase iphone can surely put money on this. tough at this price factor one can get android with much more features. but if u want a unique experience then apple is the way to go,5
2288,Just buy it,"I have used a lot of phones over the years. And this is by far the best. It is totally worth 45K. Don’t go for any other phone. Simply buy this. It should give updates for atleast 4 more years. The processor is way advanced than any android out there. Privacy and security definitely better than android. I do miss the headphone jack but i can live without it.
Buy the fast charger as the 5w will take 3-4 hours to charge. Camera is awesome. Night mode is not as good as pixel but works good enough.",5
2289,"Beautiful Phone, careless delivery","Very expensive phone compared to the competitors. But iOS and apple’s smoothness and responsiveness can’t be equalled. Happy with the offers provided by Amazon, makes iPhone a possible buy.

But one bad experience was the delivery. The package looks crushed and box was torn, outer packing looked untampered. Luckily the phone was not damaged.

But when purchasing such an expensive product would expect better handling of the package.

There were few negative reviews regarding this, but I thought Amazon would be more careful, But pretty shocked on the package condition.

Attached photo shots of the box I got the phone in, real miracle phone survived the transit.",3
2290,Received defective product,"First of all ,

PROS :

The battery performance was really excellent!
Unbelievable battery I am really impressed.

only 22% battery drained after 1 and half hour continue free fire gaming and 1 hour and 40 min screen on time after game

CONS : reality of sales

It was my first bad experience and worst!
The Amazon sended me a used Iphone 11 , where the packaging plastic has 2-3 scratches and inside the box
1. ""IPHONE 11 HAS DENTS 1st on the top right corner just near camera and
2nd on lower left side on the steel ..I am really disappointed with this service..
2. IF YOU are buying Iphone 11 for camera than don't go for it cuz it clicks the worst photo in night and specially in night mode.
The picture quality get burst even in normal night photo even if u have a tubelight on still...
It only clicks Superb photos in sunlight.
And seriously,
They forced me to think that the phones ordered during are are really used and worst , from nowadays I won't buy any product during sale and will buy personally from Apple store near me.
😔😔😔
Really disappointing Amazon.",1
2291,A Must read Honest Opinion,"Read a lot of negative reviews regarding buying iphone 11 from amazon but somehow gathered a lot of courage and went forward. Got it for 45k with all the bank offers and this seems to value for money.
HEATING ISSUES
You will read a lot of reviews about heating issues. Yes there is some heating issue but that went away after i updated it to ios14 and minor tweaks here and there.
BATTERY LIFE
I am not a very heavy user so it runs me for about 1.5 days, it would vary upon usage but it would last you for one entire day for sure
BACK CAMERA
I loved it but am quite disappointed with the front camera
OPERATING SYSTEM
Ios really makes life so so easy there are so many small small features that apple might not market about but it makes your life so so easy. Its experience is way better than android. I was myself a stock android user but seeing the flexibility with ios, you might not ever switch back",4
2292,If You Want Show Off iPhone Logo Then Buy Otherwise Go For Android,"bro if you are Android user and you love Android then don't buy iPhone,because in iPhone you will not get any customisation and you will have to to see listen music online you can download it offline in wynk music or any other music app

if you can listen online everything then it's ok, YouI can buy this iPhone for better camera quality awesome software experience like fast UI but not best customisable software, because you can't Tweak iPhone

battery is really poor so whatever if you want to buy then buy it - for Showing off iPhone Logo

otherwise I will say you will get better phone in Android so if you want to buy any Android then go for Android because you will get lots of storage and better camera is also Android camera is really good above 50k Indian rupees",5
2293,Amazon didnt provide cashback related to offer with this phone,"The phone is good, i have no issue with phone. But
I have purchased iphone 11 on the first day of great Indian festival sale i.e. October 16th. There was a bonus offer on hdfc cards in which they were giving 1250 apay cashback for the transaction more than 30k.

On 18th October they have removed the bonus offer on iphone11. Since I have purchased it when the offer was active so I should be eligible for the cashback. My friends who have ordered same product at same time have got cashback on same day.

But now they all are saying that we can’t give you the cashback as the offer became inactive on 18th.",1
2294,Happy to have this phone,"Again editing my review after using it for almost 2 weeks, initially, on call volume was soo low that on every call i had to put on speaker but that problem solved itself. So phone is doing great till now . Only thing is charging adapter comes only of 5w which is charging very slow, so had to buy 12w adapter separately. Overall happy with product",5
2295,Android is far better than this,"I was using android from last 8 years then I switched to iPhone and I don’t know for other people experience but mine is really not worth to have this device.

After using 6-8 months it start heating like hell.

Some of the applications is not that much smoother.

Battery backup I think every body knows about this haha you should keep your phone on battery saver all the time

AppStore is not good as play store but for my kind of user (a basic phone user ) it is okay.

Camera is fine but when you’re spending this much of amount you expect more.

So moral of the story is if you are a person who would love to show off your assets then you should go for iPhone because I felt the same, people start acknowledging you hahaha

Android >>>>>>> iPhone for me",2
2296,👎🏻,Amazon is worst. Backed out from the cash back which I was supposed to get as a part of bonus offer.. but I will take this matter to court for sure..,1
2297,Perfect phone,"If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don’t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it’s always great to buy products from Amazon.

This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review
1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update
2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)
3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.
4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But recommend you buy original fast apple charger.
5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.
6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ₹1500 to ₹2000)
7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.
8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.
9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that’s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage
10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset
11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.
12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice",5
2298,Honest review after using for 1 month,"I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.
I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.

Pros:
1. Superb processor- My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth
2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode
3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient
4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date
5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applications

Cons:
1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone
2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores
3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.
4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.
5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.

Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.",5
2299,Worst and pathetic experience while shopping with Amazon !!,"Most pathetic and worst service from Amazon , I got a damaged product , iPhone 11 product I received was having damaged microphone and I confirmed the same from apple authorised service centre. After several escalation calls to Amazon customer representative, they committed on call that they will provide replacement of product and later they said Amazon technician will visit my place and inspect the product but the technician did not visit my place and customer representative finally says we will only refund and not replacement. After making the customer wait for 1 week , this is what they come up. Darshit Electronics cheats people by saying they don’t have mobile phone when asked for replacement of a damaged product but they have mobile phones to sell for other customers!!! Low level....

Worst experience!!",1
2300,Fault in Product,Speaker is not in proper working condition. Voice output is burst while playing music. Moreover amazon is not giving me return/refund of product option. Worst experience.,1
2301,Excellent !! Do not hesitate to buy!,"I am writing this review because before deciding to buy one for myself, I was going through the reviews and there were a quite a few of them mentioning that people should avoid buying an iPhone from Amazon.
However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.
I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.

The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android.",5
2302,Iphone 11 - gets u awestruck!,"Not much to write about an iphone. This is my 1st iphone and i was hesitant to switch to ios from android. But im glad i did. U get the cream experience of everything on the phone , camera ,sound ,screen ,os , security. No comparison with so called android 108mp camera, u get studio quality photos, lastly , amazon deal was cherry on the cake with all accessories. Go fr it !",5
2303,An apple for everyone. 🍎,"At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.
FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:
Cons
1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.
2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.
3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.
4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.
5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.
6. This phone is heavy.
7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. 😉🤫
You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.
Pros
1. Battery backup is super in my usage.
2. Camera's were as hyped.
3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.
4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.
5. IP68 rating a must have.

If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.",4
2304,The BEST ❤️,"I LOVE IT 😌
I mean now I can finally understand why everyone is so crazy about iPhones! Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!
Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!
Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won’t regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :)
About the battery life, it’s not bad but it’s not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!",5
2305,100% Authentic product by Appario!,"No comments on Quality of Apple, this is my 5th iPhone.
Only fear was Authenticity and reliability of what exactly is going to be delivered.

IT WAS iPhone 11 ONLY and 100% Real, Original and Sealed One...!

Thank you Amazon and Appario.",5
2306,Best iPhone at the moment,"Apple is apple.Yes their product are quite expensive but is also value for money..Camera no doubt the best,sound quality good,design is amazing,handy to use.Got this phone at a great amazon sale offer. Loving my purchase..One of the best iphones to buy at this moment in this price range",5
2307,The phone that I needed,"After few months of waiting and research about which phone would suit me the best, I bought this in 2020.

I think there isn’t a single phone that would work for everyone, they all have different expectations and needs. I was looking for a phone that’s water resistant, takes really good videos, has powerful processing, has better than average battery life, has magnetic sensor for better navigation and provides good user experience while using the phone. Stereo speakers was an add-on. Basically, this phone has fulfilled all my expectations.",5
2308,Was on the verge of nervous breakdown before opening the package,"Like most of the people i too was worried about the product. What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZON
Coming to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
The phone is incredibly beautiful.
Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.
Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.
Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.
With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.
Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.
Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.
The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.

Will be updating more with coming days.......🙂",4
2309,Value for Money & it just put smile on ur face while using it,"This is my first iphone. After using android for so long didn't exoect to like ios so much. So yes ios is more refined compared to android. Iphone is costly yes but now a days highend android and iphone doesnt have much difference in terms of price. But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league. I dont need customisation so i am liking ios better. But if u are more into customization thing then u may go for android. And final verdict.. Iphn 11 is a complete package and a real value for money. I really enjoy using it.",5
2310,Would love to❤️,"Look at my new phone, and its sweet color!! Thanks to Amazon and the special guy who gifted me this phone! This is a great choice❣️",5
2311,Excellent phone,"After reading all the negative feedbacks on Appario retail and that too after placing the orders, I was very scared of receving defective or used iphone but after getting both the phones I can say both the phones are new and fantastic. I am really happy & satisfied with the phones.",5
2312,Adaptor and Earpods missing,"I ordered this phone and it was clearly mentioned that this phone will be delivered with Power cord and EarPod.
But, this item doesn't contains power cord and Earpod. I had a call with Customer executive and he was not agree.",1
2313,Quality vs Rest of those in markets,I had iPhone 6s and it’s been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this. unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.,4
2314,Finaly Happy To Have iPhone 11,"I was waiting since 10 days for delivery, but no worries as finally happy to have my iPhone 11 (128) GB. I have upgraded from iPhone 6S and everything is awesome in this one. Thanks to Apple & Amazon for this lovely device. ",5

2317,The perfect phone,"Have been an iPhone user for a while. Moving from the 6s, this is the perfect upgrade.
- Great display
- Great battery life
- Camera is nice too
- ios 14 makes this even better

At the price point offered on amazon, this is the perfect upgrade",5
2318,Amazing Phone its Rocket in Pocket,Dont think so much purchase it and enjoy. I was also Android user since 2008. Just go for it iPhone is IPhone. Since Last month I was android user but one youtuber Nabeel suggested for iPhone and after purchasing iPhone i am fully satisfied with iPhone. Non of Android phone can give that much of experience. PUBG Mobile is very smooth and Camera is amazing no phone can beat it. I purchased iPhone 11 128GB in sale for 49K. Don’t hesitate just go for iPhone and you will not regret. If have any question regarding iPhone 11 you can ask me at email alok76000@gmail.com,5
2319,Want to share my experience about amazon,First i want to say about amazon look there are lot of roumors about fake product and all but amazon is really trusted company from years and I personally experienced it how the packing of my iphone 11 good is and customer service provided. Now Let’s come to product see if you thinking about switching on android to ios then absolutely go for it really very good experience of apple. worth product and also some peoples worried about LCD display panel bt believe me the display of iPhone 11 is just amazing even you can’t notice that you are using LCD panel that was I experience from shifting k20’s super amoled display to 11’s lcd panel and about battery no need it’s enough for daily users thank you amazon.,5
2320,Worth it !!,"I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.

Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.

The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.
The screen size is really cool.

The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.

The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.

Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎",4
2321,OnePlus 8T is better,"I've bought both iPhone 11 and OnePlus 8T. Found OnePlus 8T to be better. 8T has better software, charging speed, battery life etc. despite being cheaper. On 11 i faced a bug in app store because of which i wasn't able to install any app. The bug was error message ""this apple id has not been used in itunes store"" shown in loop. Found a workaround for this bug after spending much time and effort. (I'm on Linux so accessing iTunes wasn't straightforward.)",2
2322,"Genuine purchase, genuine product ...","I generally don't prefer to buy any expensive electronic gadgets like iPhone from any e-commerce portal. I read many negative comments from the reviews section. My plan was to buy iPhone11 128 Gig and particularly Yellow color. I checked the Amazon Sale price and the market price and the difference was 5k INR. I still wanted to buy from the nearest apple authorized retailer but there was some technical issue with the HDFC card and I could not buy it. Then after thinking so much, I tried to buy from Amazon sale on 16th-Oct-2020. The iPhone arrives and I checked the product is fully compliance and 100% genuine. I got full 1 year apple warranty and the product model number. And the best thing is my iPhone is Make in India. I am loving it :) ...",5
2323,Over priced for sure though I don’t mind the price,"One word review
BEST

I once used it for 11 days straight with single charge was on standby mostly and listened 3-5 songs each day for 11 days.

I upgraded from IPhone se to this and was amazed with the performance

This iPhone is future proof and will last you for foreseeable future just go for it",5
2324,Received a defective piece,I received a defective phone the calls and speaker sound is distorted... have raised a complaint with Apple assistant n they hv asked me to observe my phone for 24 hrs ... now I just blew money n here I m waiting .... very disappointed,1
2325,My first iphone,"Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it’s mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it’s little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .

If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.",5
2326,iPhone 11 is a flagship & more!,"Spectacular!

Positive:-
1.Battery- 7:30-8 hrs screen time which is great easily lasting a day & more.12 watt charger(bought separately) charges to 70% in 1 hour,so good.

2.iOS.iOs.iOS.if u hav an iPad/Mac life will be easier with an iPhone.

3.Camera:- good.Honestly I expected more.Portrait mode is great.Nightscape is yet to be tested.Best video camera.

4.Performance:-
A13 Bionic chipset.4gb ram. Enuf said.throw anything-iPhone 11 will do it with ease.

5.Future updates

Negatives:-

1.Bulky & display:
The phone really feels heavy & with the lcd notch panel,it is highly unsuitable for binge watching.The wired EarPods is odd & doesn’t help either.",5
2327,Please don't ever purchase apple products from Amazon,".

They will definitely make fool out of you, I had received defective products with front and back camera issue capturing blurry effects plus instead of airpod sent headset.

And no one taking the ownership for replacing, not apple Store, not Amazon, nor vendor",1
2328,Brutally honest review: Switched from ios to android and now to ios,"Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.

Pros:
1. Best battery life in an iPhone - 3110 mAh
2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )
3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)
4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.
5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.
6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.
7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).
8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.
9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.
10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.
11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)
12. Premium feel phone
13. Its an iphone
14. Good resale value

Cons:

1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)
2. Minor software limitations as compared to android
3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs
4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)
5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.

Conclusion:
I would personally rate this at 9.5/10
If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it’s as easy as that
And as for me, I’m very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.",5
2329,How does Amazon sell iPhones cheaply,"How is Amazon able to sell iPhone 11 at 48999?

Simple it’s refurbished models by Apple
Check the model number at the back of the box, if it starts with F it’s refurbished by Apple

Since it’s refurbished by Apple it will still have the 1 year warranty but now you understand how the prices are so cheap",5
2330,Ease of use is an issue in some scenarios,"Too pricey,

Gifted it to sister. Before making a whatsapp video call I have to call her first becuase sound of video calls is too low for one to notice. Many other Ease of use issues, this was just a practical example.

You charge 65k for a phone and cannot provide basic things and annoy people.",3
2331,Expensive should be Avoided during online Shopping,I got Defective Piece from Amazon. Nobody helping me with resolving issue. Total waste of money And Time,1
2332,Amazon is best nd their sellers are too good personally thanks to apario.,"First of I would like to share my experiences after placed order of Iphone 11 128 GB black mobile in sale with discount price.
I was worry about product quality nd delivery because lots of negative reviews seen on YouTube nd also in this platform.
Some people claimed that they received fake products or defective products so I was also lill bit tense .
I placed this order dated 19.01.21 nd got my iphone 11 22nd morning , for precaution I done recording delivery process nd unboxing too .
Now I can say that people shouldn't doubt on Amazon and their products which they deliver.
My primary phone is iPhone 12 Pro Max nd this one is my secondary phone because it's size matters for me , very handy 6.1 inch screen size so it's comfortable to use single hand .
Quality is best , battery life 100% nd camera quality is also becnchmark of this segment.
Warranty is now active when activate phone.

2333,Perfect iPhone with best camera and performance,"Brought this iPhone on Amazon for 54999rs on 18th October 2020. Good price for the 128GB variant. Using it for a week, really awesome mobile, performance, camera all are perfect. Took this mobile to the apple store and verified it's a apple product. It came with headphones and charger within the box.

Really good for this price. I'm really happy.

Guys always go for the Amazon fulfilled sellers. Saw lots for negative reviews on social media for both amazon and flipkart selling fake iPhones. All are not true. If you have any doubts go and check you device with apple store. See my uploaded picture what's comes in the box. , it will help.",5
2334,Best phone in all iPhone's,"Delivery was a bit late, i absolutely love this mint green colour, bought on deal, loving my phone, absolutely recommend this iPhone 11,if you can afford. You can know more about the features and performance from the reviews on YouTube. 😊 This is a major update for me from oppo to iPhone. Loving it. ❤️",5
2335,Right Phone to Upgrade from iPhone 6/6s/7...,"Right choice to upgrade for iPhone 6/6s/7 user. Battery life is excellent. Presently it lasts for 36 hours for me.
Camera- one of the best, if compared with other brand.
Only cons- the phone box does not contain any separate connector to connect the wired earphone. You have to use the same earphone which came with the box. Otherwise go wireless.",5
2336,A must if you are upgrading from previous gen,"Was hardcore into android with rooting and all , moved to iPhone three years ago with iPhone 7 , and I no longer see spec sheets cause the performance is always at par with Apple , with frequent updates you can literally use it for years , switched to iPhone 11 and trust me the screen is really good , I know it’s only HD screen but trust me it won’t make drastic difference, besides lcd screens have better life than amoled as per me , amoled screens tend to have burn in issues over the time , with latest processor and great camera this is definitely great phone , plus it has dual sim (e-sim) it has come very handy to me during foreign trips as most radio frequencies are supported by Apple",5
2337,Super Phone with Premium Look,"I just upgrade my iphone6 to iphone11 and its a game changer for me...

Prons:-
Camera:- Best in class no one can beat it
Battery:- Good battery life at one charge
Software:- A13 Bionic which make this phone super fast. Best in industry
Face Id:- No one can give you fast face unlock. Apple nailed it again
Looks:- Premium Phone with Premium look. Black colour is like Jawdrop

Cons:-
Charger:- still 5W charger
Screen:- No HD display. only 720p
Notch:- Very thick Notch which make this phone old
Weight:- Lil bit heavy

Overall:- 8/10 Worth buy it",5
2338,Great phone.. but disappointed with amazon delivery,Great phone... Great deal.. but Amazon needs to train their customer support better.. i ordered the phone on 16oct and got it delivered on 4th nov despite being a prime member.. despite multiple calls none of the customer support could figure out the reason for delay when atlast one person said the issue is between the payment bank and amazon without any fault of mine.. and one mail to the bank resolved the issue.. lot of hassles could hv been avoided if the customer support was trained appropriately regarding the error codes they are seeing on the system..very disappointed..,5
2339,Awesomenees and smoothness yes it’s IPhone,"If u have points and planning for not changing phone 2to 4 year that iPhone 11 is best option

It’s my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it’s make me happy

About iphone11
Processor is awesome there is no lag
Camera and haptic touch is very good
I seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don’t know how to use mobile data option

Battery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XR

It’s display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.

So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don’t worry about features like 5G.
in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational",5
2340,Heating Issue,It heats up quickly from the first day. I tried a lot to reduce the heating issues but it still present even in normal uses also. Lot of time called the amazon customer care but their reply was disappointing and cut the calls during the conversations. Heating issue still on after the updates and reset ma phone.,1
2341,Apple is Love ❤️,I have upgraded from Iphone 7 to this & it’s really COOL 😎. Just go for it amazing camera specially the night mode and portrait. Just to add one thing it’s battery dies in one whole day after full charge. Though it depends you use this as personal or professional. I use this as professionally with high no of calls per day using this personally battery life I think will be much much higher as compared.,5
2342,Just an average phone with hefty price!,"I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.
Battery is okay.
Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.
Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.",3
2343,iPhone is not getting charged.,I was very happy when I received my iphone 11 package and this is my first apple product. After opening i came to know the charger not working. I didn't expect this from amazon and customer care leave it to our fate. Don't buy an expensive product like iphone on amazon particularly during sale. The best thing to do is to buy from an apple store.,1
2344,Pathetic experience ...defected product,I bought iPhone 11(128GB) on the same day of delivery when I used it for 10-20 mins only it started heating...Again after some time when I tried the heating issue was there...I am trying to contact for refund but there is no response from Amazon...This is the worst experience ...Never buy expensive products from Amazon....I need my money back.,1
2345,First time apple user & as secondary phone to one and only Nokia - Read full review,"First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.
Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,
Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.
Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.
After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.
Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.
Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested.
Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price.
IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.",4
2346,Well developed device,"After upgrading from iPhone 6 it feels quite good to use a flagship model like this. Camera quality is awesome, battery backup is way better compared to the previous models of iPhone, A13 Bionic chip is really powerful, if you’re a gamer you must own this device, PUBG,Asphalt etc runs smoothly in this device but the device heats up while playing games. We’ll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it’s literally a beast in all aspects",4
2347,Four Years Wait For IPHONE,"This is the one brand for which i was waiting for four years, literally i purchased this mobile only for brand, many of them have a dream to buy a apple from own money as i also had and it took me four years, After the use of more then ten days am posting this review am very much happiee with the performance of this beauti,, especially the camera is the biggest pros",5
2348,Cheap Quality,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Quality not adequate. Camera quality is worst. Video recorder doesn't have pause button hence you need to buy extra app and after spending money on that app you're gonna get cheap quality videos. I couldn't return because of limitations. But it's not worth spending 66k for this phone. My one plus 5t has far far better quality of camera and has all required features. In short I would like to tell that I'm extremely disappointed after purchasing this phone",1
2349,I Love Iphone,Very good pic quality / Battery life is bad / Iphone best,5
2350,u can buy in this price range,"1st time bought an apple product, fully different experience. The OS is not user friendly like android but it's interesting.
The camera quality is quite impressive. The night camera is also good, but there is a little issue which I was not supposed, and ie. when you move ur hand or any non-living object it blurs the image and I was supposing that iPhone will fix it... But the sensor is very good... face detection is awesome...",5
2351,Poor replacement service,"Mobile sound is cracking and earphone one side ear piece is not working

And Amazon is not providing replacement service instead it is asking to get it done with Apple store though i ordered yesterday only",1
2352,Kindly read the revised service policy of Apple before buying,Worst mistake of my life. I have brought this product for my feyonce and my trouble started from that day onwards. Mobile display was faulty and when i reached apple store they kept the iphone for 1 week and replaced the display. After 1 day same issue happened again still the same cycle. Its 3rd time that same issue is coming.,1
2353,Best price for iPhone,"The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‘in-house’ card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.",5
2354,Discrimination if service by apple,Using since one month issue with display contacted customer service they told issue with display they will replace which is not that expected changed display Face ID not working if this issue would have been in any other country apple would have replaced phone but in india we have to get second class service highly disappointed with apple,1
2355,Buying mobile phones from Amazon is wastage of money,The day when I received the iphone11 it's hearing speaker is not working while receiving call and while calling someone it's making some beeping sound I contact with customer care but there was no response so pls don't buy things from amazon they are selling duplicate products to customers so pls don't waste ur savings with Amazon,1
2356,Awesome Phone I have Used So Far,"Upgraded from iPhone 6s, I am totally happy with my new iPhone 11. Everything meets perfection on Apple as always, and the Camera is exceptional. Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app.

Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.

PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.",5
2357,Masterpiece,"Apple - another masterpiece. Camera is so real followed by powerful processor. Such a superior experience so far. Hope this continues!

Amazon - Delivery in less than 24 hours, you just nailed this prime thingi. Although i followed up, but you fullfilled your promise as usual. Kudos and thanks for delivering the device in such a perfect way... thank you...",5
2358,Good phone - but broke the display,"Phone is too good, but fell and broke the display in a week of purchase.
Apple care did not agree to change the display and pay 40k n get it replaced.",2
2359,Face ID is not working,"My Face ID recognition is not working. Spoke with Apple customer care, their instructions didn't work, later went to the iPhone service center too, They said it might be a hardware problem, and asked us to return the phone since I bought it today, But I can't able to return the mobile in amazon. They said 30 days replacement warranty. But when I choose the replacement option, they ask me again to talk with the customer care. poor service amazon",2
2360,My Bestie Beast,"It’s a monster. But a good one though. A true beast among phones. Awesome camera, battery life, sound, processing and face recognition. Me, and my spouse, both are using iPhone 11 and we both are real happy with the product. She has got red one and mine is black. Totally satisfied with iPhone 11 and got at nice rate. No issues till now. Thanks to Apple and Amazon. A perfect purchase if you have got enough money 😈",5
2361,Amazing Device!,"To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus.

It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!",5
2362,Very Smooth device..,"Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight. The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.",4
2363,Don’t buy Apple products from Amazon,"There is no issue or concern with an Apple product as long as we buy it from an Apple store. Amazon does not take place any replacement if we find any defect.
The phone i got had a defect that the power button did not work. I tried to replace the device but Amazon rejected and asked me to contact Apple for replacement or anything of that sorts.

Good job Amazon! Sell defective products and make customers run like crazy to get value for money. Cheers",4
2364,Product issue,"Please check the phone .. when I call some one from this phone after talking, I click on my phone screen to cut the call but despite that the screen keep showing black then I press the switch off button from the side even it the screen remain black and the after while this is ok.. please change my product otherwise confirm my query",2
2365,Great buy indeed,"Switched from Android and iOS for first time and apple did not disappoint.
Battery backup is great , easily goes for one and half day with moderate use.
I chose this over iPhone 12 mini especially due to battery, and 5G is still far away in India.
Night mode of camera is impressive as expected.
Os is smooth.
I was reluctant about experience before purchase but it turned out good decision.

First day experience lot of heat in back panel but looks like initial setup involved lot of activities that could be reason, after turning radios like data and Bluetooth as needed , it got resolved , in general usage there is no heat problem.
Charging speed is good too.
With 45W adaptor, goes 0-100 in around 90 minutes.",5
2366,Beast,"I don't know why people have bad things to say about the product or the delivery.
IPhone 11 is a beast
Also the product is genuine
Don't give a second thought.",5
2367,Best phone ever!!! Its so fun to use.,"Its a really fun device to use and the battery life is quite good however the fun stops when you need to charge it. It just takes too long to charge on the Apple Charger that’s included in the box. The display is really good too, I had used an S8 before coming from OLED, it doesn’t matter the experience is amazing you won’t miss OLED because of this. Speakers are great, color is awesome! Feels so good without the case i Have to use it without the case. Dual sim is working great too.",5
2368,Go for Market shopping rather than online.,The camera quality is too bad. I just purchased this phone in last month but without any physical damage phone started working improperly. Pictures quality is also not that good. The same phone I had purchased in month of September from Mall and that is working totally fine till now. But I suggest to all that go for real time physical shopping for this phone. Without any reasons I'm facing too many problems. So I suggest to buy it from market. So you can easily check everything about phone.,1
2369,Absolutely the best phone I’ve used till date,"I’ve always been a loyal android user, have used only high end android phones - nexus , Samsung galaxy series, S9 plus and the like. I was very apprehensive about shifting to iOS as I was told android is much more flexible and I will not be able to adjust to Apple. My phone got delivered before time, I charged it and started using it by afternoon. Took a couple of hours for data transfer and by evening I was completely in love with this phone. Was amazed by the interface and no nonsense whatsoever kind of vibe from this phone. I also got it at a very reasonable price from amazon shopping festival. Thank you Amazon and Apple !",5
2370,Read review'sbefore buying,"The most flowed Apple product,
Received Apple 11 (128GB)
on Saturday 8th August .
And review in 9th August ,
Please spare a movement before buying The Apple product.
The touch and proximity sensors won't work .
The wifi and touch have huge response delay ,
The sellers have should have mentioned that product sold can't be replaced (other than contacting Apple support center )
The worst experience of what could have ever experience for Appple products.
Trust me don't ever buy Apple products from this platform ,The seller has no accountability and platform is not transparent on return details .
Most un trust worth experience",1
2371,"Amazing Phone, Superb display","Honestly the feel of phone, colors in it is extremely standard. This may not have OLED screen but honestly the quality is top-notch. However if it had OLED, it would be much more battery efficient.
This is first time for me to have an iphone as recently I switched from android. I am switching from k20 pro that had OLED and 90 Hz display. Honestly 60 Hz is the only thing on this phone that bugged me else screen is brilliant. Gaming is fire smooth.
Camera is too damn good. Extremely detailed to be precise. I have never used the camera of a phone before this much. Night mode pictures are clearly to fall in love with. If you buy quick charger you are then set to use it. Battery is really good but 5W charger is definitely not helping, earphones are also good.",5
2372,Worst camera front and back,Worst experience with camera i never expected this worse experience in camera other things are super cool but i came to know after 5 months by comparing it with my friend iphone 11. Bought XR and even that has lock button issue instantly locks!! Dont buy online guys buy it in store and when u purchase do compare the phone with other iPhones if it you will be fooled.!!,2
2373,Excellent phone (even in comparison to iphone 12 when you consider the price.),"I got it for 48.5k (128 GB version) and at this price point its a an excellent product (compare it with oneplus 9 but will beat it on performance, longevity and camera from in case if these are your priorities). Its a real value for money when compared to iphone 12 mini (upwards of 65K+ for 128GB but smaller battery) and iphone 12 (80k+ for 128GB variant). You wont miss much on camera and performance front. True that the new boxy design is sexier and the screen has improved. But the premium you have to pay is too big (around 20k).
P.S: I would strongly suggest to go for 128 GB version irrespective of the version of iphone. 64GB is too less and you will start to encounter space issues within six months or so (if you are a casual user).",5
2374,Top notch apple product and that too vfm,"Handsdown to the best vfm apple product right now on the sale. I was so skeptical reading the negative reviews from the seller named - appario
But then eventually things were pretty cool.
Got it delivered within a day.
And the box was sealed with no dents or anything crap which you might have read in the previous reviews. ✌🏻 Also if you wanna jump to the ios ecosystem, you may opt for xr which was available for 36k during the sale, or even low for the SE2
These products won't disappoint you ! 💯💯💯",5
2375,Genuine Apple Device,"Product : iPhone 11 (White, 128GB)

Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and impressed with Amazon and Seller for this experience.

PS: These are 1st impressions, I'll be reviewing it again.",5
2376,Overall Great Deal,"I purchased this phone during Oct festive sale and I am happy with the product.
If u wanna buy the phone I am assuming u have gone through tons of reviews and videos.

Everything is good until I checked GPS. It’s not working properly each and every time. I am residing in Bangalore but my location is based in Romania😂
And still I am unable resolve the issue. Hope a software update will fix this bug.",4
2377,Look no further,"I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.

I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.

I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.",5
2378,Over rated product,"Its being more then 8 months so writing the pros and cons:

Pros:
1. Camera quality
2. Lag free performance

Cons:
1. Display is average, color reproduction is below average
2. No finger print sensor and face id detection is slow
3.battery life is average
4. Low customisation option if you are used to android
5.over rated product and not worth its cost",5
2379,Costlier,"Not worth
Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand and also hanging. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue with hanging . Seems defective piece. I need refund asap. I have paid 54k for a defective phone. I am feeling like fixed with Amazon scam",1
2380,"Not product review, its about Amazon ☺️","Received original product one day before the mentioned date.
I saw videos where most of the people said they received fake product from amazon, i was scared but it looks the people who make such videos are fake.
This is my 4 mobile from amazon and all received products are original.
In terms of iphone review no doubt about their quality and reliability.

I am happy and satisfied customer of Amazon.

Thankyou!!",4
2381,Don't fall for Amazon Marketing. Honestly!,"Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.

I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.

Pros
1. Professional delivery.
2. Product received as described.
3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.
4 Received a made in India device.

Cons
1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.
I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.
2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.
3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.

Conclusion:
If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.",3
2382,Easiest Phone to Review. Read further to get the gist,"Pros :
-Great camera! The best ever. You don’t need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.
-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.
-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage
-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage
-Games run insanely well with high end graphics
-Wireless Charging
-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhones
Cons:
-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn’t agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool
-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.
-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%
-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates
-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don’t know why apple is being stupid on this
-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box
-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale
-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb
-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.",5
2383,"Best buy, Thanks to Amazon great india festival","I recieved my order in 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for the swift delivery. I have been using apple for almost 3 years and trust me if you are upgrading from a old iphone then iphone 11 is the best option to go. The camera is the best and the sound quality is super excellent. I am sure that you will fall for the red colour one, maybe thats my preference.",5
2384,Review after 1 week of use,"I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.

The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.

This is a great phone with minimal flaws.
The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark rooms

The small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don’t have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.

The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product’s like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.
Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.

If you’re looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.

Peace",5
2385,Bad experience with a Faulty phone!,"Lured by the big discount during the sale bought an iPhone 11 128GB black phone. Extremely disappointed with amazon! You guys sent a phone with faulty screen! And there was no option of contacting customer care. All attempts were leading to Apple customer care details. Finally upon contacting the Apple customer care, they advised to take it nearest Apple service centre. The service centre was reluctant asking to contact amazon, as it was bought from amazon. The service centre guys mentioned that they have had many such compliants with regards to issues with iPhones delivered from amazon! Hope you guys are not delivering substandard and poor quality phones under the guise of discounted products!
I would be henceforth very skeptical buying any high value products from amazon! Sorry to say this!",1
2386,Fast Delivery,"It is an iPhone. No other words required. I like the battery life but I still think they could have made it better. No complaints though, have been using it for a month now and the performance has been awesome. Cannot compare it to an android. It is a matter of taste/preference and now that I have switched to IOS, I am not willing to leave it and switch back to android. Probably because iOS is pretty simplistic, just the way I like it.

iPhones are not worth 70k I guess but I got it for 53K which is definitely worth it. It is good if you get an iPhone for around 50. Hence I decided to buy this instead of the new 12",5
2387,Best buy under 50k,"Best deal if you are getting it under 50k. Received it from Darshita electronics, color Green, and the product is genuine with no technical issues. I don’t have to say about the camera as it is best in class. Battery backup is great in comparison with iphone 12 - you can get a full day with moderate usage. If you are heavy gamer then you may need to charge it twice a day , and my suggestion is to get a fast charger in this case as the current 5w charger takes 2-3 hours for a full charge. My suggestion is to buy it from a retail store (however the chances of a faulty product is nil) as it is costly affair and the return policy for apple products is not that great on Amazon, please check return policy before buying it online.",5
2388,Expensive Device,"iPhone 11 prose and cons
Prose
1-Smooth
2-Front camera Excellent
3-battery backup ok
4-Sound quality good.
5-iphone logo
Cons
1-Selfie camera not for selfie
2- No free apps in store
3-No call recorder
4- No video downloader app in aap store
5-No notification Led
6-No always on display
7- you can't download any ringtone from outside.
Final-It is better to use flagship android mobile instead of iphone.You can go for it if you only want to adopt iphone logo.",4
2389,Fake charger what apple support team told me,Had bad experience with iPhone 11 charger adaptor. It stopped working after some day. I did not go to apple service center due to lockdown. Later when lockdown was over I went to apple service center and I heard shocking news about my adaptor the Resq (apple has tie-up with reliance to support apple)executive told me that the adaptor is fake one and he can not replace it. Another sock came after I checked my case id online where the executive did not mentioned that he can not provide replacement because I have fake product instead what he wisely canceled my appointment. So guys there is big scam going on apple support is not interested to fix smal issue the user has to bear all the charges for the same.,1
2390,Engineered to perfection.,"10 months ago
i've had android for 5 years i was looking for a change in pace when i switched over to boost. My first iphone was a 6s Plus with boost mobile, after having it for a week i became an iphone fan. i overall enjoyed the camera, processing power,and the polarizing display. What i did not like was the battery life, that aspect needed improvement. When the boost guy at store mentioned i could get a new phone through payments i looked into a new device because i did not enjoy the battery life lasting me 4 to 6 hours after being charged 100%. So after talking to apple experts and even samsung enthusiasts i came to the cross road of the s10e and iphone 11 (the regular) and decided to give a go on the iphone 11 after the store rep mentioned iphones pick up better compared to samsung in the area i live. SURE ENOUGH!!! spots with no signal..BOOM! SERVICE! now keep in mind im not saying you'll have service every where you go due to some areas having no service, but i can vouch that areas my iphone 6s plus struggled to load or pick up a siganl bar at drastically improved. ALONG WITH BATTERY LIFE!!! this phone lasts me 10 to 12 hours off a single charge. keep in mind no i do not use low power mode thats just how good the battery life is on the iphone 11. lastly, i know there's android devices on the market that boast a big screen, long lasting battery life, and good cameras which are cheaper compared to iphones but thats the problem i kept running into was finding a durable phone. after 5 years of using the android platform i went through 8 or 10 devices from zte, lg, and samsung. all because the storage was too full, or because an antennae or battery had burned out. from what i hear iphone 11 users should expect a life span of 3 years. thats pretty good considering i go through phones because of internal issues not physical damage like crazyyy!!! overall look the iphone 11 is engineered quality in the camera, storage, battery, processing and display department. the price is well worth THE QUALITY put into this phone",4
2391,Awesome buy!,"Worth buying! It’s an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it’s more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!
What I say is don’t compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile..",5
2392,Heating issues when you use outside,"You won’t be able to use this phone when you use it outside and if the temperature is more than 29 degree Celsius, your phone will heat because you will b using phone data. You are only allowed to use inside and when you have AC, and connected to WiFi. Definitely not for the temperature in India. Forget about summer, better you don’t take phone outside in summers 😂.",1
2393,A good deal if under 45K,"Iphone 11 is a great phone if you get it under 45k
I’ll describe my review in pros and cons

Pros:
1. Amazing camera quality
2. User experience is fantastic
3. Processor is super-fast and multitasking is buttery smooth
4. Feels premium : Design is stylish
5. Timely updates

Cons:
1. Average battery life (typical one day usage on moderate usage)
2. Need to buy a separate fast charger, charging time is damn slow with the regular one
3. Feels Bulky and heavy in hand
4. IPS lcd panel with retina HD resolution but screen quality not that bad (No amoled, No FHD), but considering the competition amoled should have been there

To summarise its a great phone with amazing cameras with some cons but would surpass many android smartphones in performance and camera department in this price bracket!",4
2394,Issue with speaker,First time I phone 11 very bad experience dont purchase on amazon my phn having issue with speaker and then call to amzon support he is taking to me no responsiblity of amzon in case of apple product contact with apple support worst experience,2
2395,Was expecting a better experience....Lot more problematic.,"I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing.
Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice.
There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its better to avoid iphone dual sim models.
The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software & camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.",3
2396,Amazon is trustable ... genuine product,"At first i was so suspicious to order it from amazon after reading so many negative reviews.... but then also i take a risk to order it from amazon . It got delivered in 4 days and i am completely satisfied with amazon products. It was a new phone not refurbished or clone . And it gives a proper warranty of 1 year .

Returning to product ...

At starting i feel heating while setting up my phone ... i was earlier using Poco F1 so i feel some heat due to it’s glass back ... but it was not much ... slightly warmer at back because of that glass back .

Battery life is very good ... but very slow charging.

Camera is awesome u will love the images ... even in low light .

Gaming performance is brilliant.

Cone is that it’s display is slightly dull ... as its just ips lcd display.

Overall u will enjoy using this phone",5
2397,Check all features of phone after receiving it before expiry of warranty,I had received this phone on time as indicated before placing order. After receiving phone I tried for Set up of FACEid lot of times but was unable to set. So I have contacted Apple support. After verifying the phone remotely they have advised me to take phone to Apple Service Center. I booked online appointment at Service Center and taken the phone there. Service engineer tried to repair it but failed and they have replaced my old phone with new phone without any costs. Phone is working very smoothly and it’s very fluid in working. Battery lasts for a Day after full charging in morning. Camera is excellent. Overall phone is very good.,3
2398,Display showing issues after four months of usage for Iphone 11,"Initially Nice quality and timely delivery by the Seller Darshita electronics.
But after four months of usage display is showing coloured lines and looks like HW issues is developed.
Such an expensive phone and not stable and durable is questionable!",2
2399,"Iphone 11 Mic issues,","Don't buy the iPhone on Amazon. They get from vendors who sell cheap pieces or pieces that have issues. I bought it on 21st Oct and since 3 days the mic is not working. I have tried to reach out to Apple support, they are asking me to get it serviced. When we buy a brand new phone, within two weeks it goes for service! what does that mean??, did we get a refurbished one or a faulty one? Better to buy at Stores.",1
2400,Dont buy iphone from Amazon,"Please guys dont buy it from Amazon..Something is wrong with the seller.They are selling used product instead of new one.The camera quality was pathetic.And when I tried to create my apple id for the first time on this phone I got an error saying( maximum No. Of apple id created from this device) but then after 3 to 4 attempts I was able to create it.I called apple care i called amazon,but the kept procrastinating.Finally after a month when I showed it to apple customer service outlet,they accepted that the camera quality was not upto mark.Now they have taken my phone and have sent it to bangalore for repair..I am left with no iphone,all the stress and all this thing at a price of 54999/-
Pathetic experience with Amazon",1
2401,Original phone received and working fine.,"A very honest review, first of all I would like to thank amazon to delivered the genuine product. I have received the original apple product along with all its accessories like adapter, data cable and handsfree in its box. The best part is the phone is made in India. Its being 2-3 months and phone is working fine as of date. Also I have checked on the apple site weather the phone is original or not and yes I found it original. Thank you so much Amazon for fulfilling your commitment.",5
2402,DONT BUY ON AMAZON,I bought an iPhone11 25 days before and the day before yesterday my volume key stopped working. Amazon will take returns only up to 7days from purchase. Now I've submitted for a replacement to planetcare. They say there is a possibility to reject the replacement if a third party spare change had occurred. Don't trust amazon sellers on high-priced products especially iphones. buy it from the apple store.,1
2403,Everything is great except camera quality,"Camera is okay but not that great as it was advertised and we can not say it as the world’s best camera in any smartphone because Rear camera is more than good but the selfie camera is not much good. It has a quality which we can get in ₹30,000-40,000 range smartphone. So I will give only 3 out of 5 star for the camera and for remaining other things like processor, performance, battery life etc. “these are just great” and will give 5 out of 5 stars rating!!
I’m just unhappy for the camera only!
And I think this is the most unbiased review!",4
2404,The Intelligent Phone!!!!!😘,"What to say, it “The Iphone” best in class top notch.
Its one month today exactly I have been using this I would like to rate this product like
1- camera 5/5
2- battery 5/5
3- screen 4/5
4- sound 5/5
These 5 points i feel are the most imp points in order to rate any phone out there. I just love using it this is my 3 rd iphone in 6 years and yet it didn’t disappoint me. If you want to buy a phone inside 55k this is the perfect fit for you. Privacy is the best in class not like other they still and sell you data. Its the best!!!!!!😍",5
2405,.,"Bhiya thik thak lga lo, hmesa aap hi ke pass se le jate hi.",5
2406,Must buy,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Camera quality is amZing and u can edit your pictures and videos in it too.. but the battery is not durable ..
Wide angle feature is amazing
Overally it is good",4
2407,No refund/return on my phone. Poor quality phone is dead,"It's poor quality, I was on call and suddenly the phone was switched off and till then it's not switched on yet. Poor customer services, no support from Amazon or seller.
Pathetic quality how can a Amazon sell such product or allow such seller to abuse buyers. Need urgent solution
but no assistance.",1
2408,Best Buy In 2021,"Hi friends,
Maine iPhone 11 (128gb) buy kiya tha 25 Mar 21 ko or delivery hui 27 mar 21.
Is review ko main part main divide karta hun.
01. Display: IPS LCD HD+ Koi dikkat nahi karti hai kafi majedar hai colour accuracy bahut badiya hai lekin agar aap OLED display se switch kar rahe ho to thoda sa colours fikke lag sakte hain
True Tone sabse badiya bindass features mainse ek hai apko kabhi bhi apni display ki brightness ko dekhne ki jarurat hi nahi hai ye ambient lighting ke hisab se auto adjust kar leti hai
Finally Display Best hai...... 4.5/5
Camera: Great but Video mode main Night Mode or hona chahiye tha and All camera main night mode hona chahiye tha 4.5/5",5
2409,Wonderful Phone at a Great price.,"Thanks to Amazon's ""The Great Indian Shopping Festival"" I got the best deal for this phone compared to other sites. I think I was one of the early bird to avail this great offer.
It would be stupid to give a phone review for a year old phone but for me it's perfect piece of machine at a very reasonable price. Special mention goes to the early delivery made by the Amazon courier service.
Thank you Amazon for this wonderdul deal.",5
2410,Premium phone with lots of intelligent features,"This phone is awesome. There are lots of features which are nice.
Face ID can be detected even in the dark. Battery backup is nice. Phone camera automatically adjusts to take high quality pics and the night mode is fantastic. However, I am not really happy with the front camera for taking the pics at night(May be I am not using all the options for the night mode,
I need to learn more on that).
Screen is responding very well on the feathery touch. I am already an iPhone user, so all the other best features of iPhone are already here.
Last but not the least, I would like to thank the seller for the genuine product and fast delivery with hassle free exchange. Seen the reviews about this seller, I was bit scared but my friend also got the iPhone from this seller and now I also got it. There is no problem with this seller.",5
2411,Don’t think about the negative comments guys❤️,It is my first iPhone i switched from android and m loving it it’s much better than android😍 charger and earpods were not provided because it comes with a new packaging👍 It is smooth as butter literally😍 camera is best and battery is very amazing💜 don’t think anything just go for it.,5
2412,Very good phone but not a significant improvement over the previous-gen models,"So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.

Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.

The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.

I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone 😢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.",5
2413,"Apple brand costly but ,best","I think Apple's phones that make it different.This is my first phone. I have never used Apple's phone before.It is known only after using it.I don't understand that the other company makes 64 megapixel cameras, but Apple's 12mp gives a good picture, why?",4
2414,Excellent phone for professionals ..value for money,"The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn’t not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11. I change it every 4-5 years and must say the old phone still support most of the apps i have in this. This is a great investment if you value your money and time.",5
2415,I Need Replacement.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The inside of the display looks like a dot and the rear camera has dust inside...",1
2416,Not happy at all,"From Amazon I got product on time well was paid extra for fast delivery. About product was come with one scratch near to camera. Also had heat up problem I face during video call, navigation and during call also. So Not happy with the product and as well as Amazon delivery. Was mentioned for product return but they sad visit to service center and they said have product indicated with any signal or not for heat up problem.
They updated the phone said it will not going to happen again but it’s happening again.
Was not happy with battery backups also.",3
2417,Awesome product,"Batter life is very good compared with older version's of Iphone. I am charging once in two days :-)
Face id is too good, it is working in dark also and its seamless.
Siri is slowed after upgrading to ios14
Apple carplay is awesome, there is no lag. And you can play the songs, send messages through SIRI while driving.
Camera is verygood , and we can change the portrait modes after taking the pictures. Pictures in night are not effective comparing with daylight.",5
2418,Damaged product recieved,"Black shadow on the display as i unboxed , it went away in a few minutes but came back after one hour of usage . Called Amazon and arranged for a return rightaway.",1
2419,Everything in one phone!!,"I bought white in colour and its feel solid premium!! The camera are way more than expected..

Now cons are charger and battery life but it can be fixed by fast charger..

Apart from con, i feel like its a package of everything!! Reception are more than average..

You don’t need 90 hz speed,, pubg places very smoothly!! Definitely improved my game..

In short, I am happy with my New Iphone..

Price was 48000/- and waiting for it didn’t go waste..

Thanks to amazon for delivering it on same day..",5
2420,Battery issue iphone 11,I bought this phone on 15/10/2020 .... the Battery life is pathetic within month the battery health is become 98% and within 2 months 15 days the health became 95% the the battery Health life reduction progress is very high ...when I tried with apple I care they saying it’s very normal they have nothing to do with this ..... simply they saying till 80% it’s normal ...... my question to apple it’s is 99% also normal and 80 % also .... is it so .... how can it be .... the average is not matching ..... no matter the the how much old device is within a month they battery become 90% also they saying it’s normal ... I feel the apple quality have gone down...... they are Clear with what Parameter they following on battery issue ... in apple site they have mentioned 80% 500 cycle ..... if my battery keep on draining I need to charge my phone they obviously i will meet the 500 cycle ... then they will say the cycle time reached so need to change the battery ....note in this entire usage on my phone i did n play games and the camera usage is very minimal max 50 photo I would have taken,3
2421,Offers are real. Do not ignore them because it sounds unreal and you could get a faulty product,"Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone. But negating all the confusion and risk, I ordered. And I got a perfectly normal brand new iPhone.

I am writing this review just to let everyone out there, OFFERS ARE REAL. Grab them!!",5
2422,Very good product.,"The reason why I am writing this review is some people received fraud product. I brought this too at Amazon's great Indian sale and got the right one. Its authentic and I got it checked online by just providing my ime number to apple. Delivery was on time. I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product. Speaking about battery life you should buy a 18watt fast charger either through apple store online or through third party companies such as anker. Slightly less battery backup can be compromised by fast charging.",5
2423,I’m in love with this phone..,"First of all there’s no fingerprint sensor in this, which could be an advantage for some and a disadvantage for some people too! One thing you need to note that during this pandemic (COVID-19) you can only use passcode as the only way to unlock your phone (of course while wearing a mask) now to the main topic this phone’s a great machine! This is my first iPhone and hell yeah I’m in love with it (also I cracked a great deal on this). If you wanna by your first iPhone you can consider this. But if you have iPhone X or above model right now and considering to buy This,then This phone’s Bazeels ( sorry don’t know the correct wordings or so) are gonna irritate you a lot! I’m gonna strongly recommend you this phone if your budget is about 50000.",5
2424,"""My iphone11 64gb two days experience review :)""","Nice classy metallic finishing. Camera quality were with 12 megapixel sensor is okay but not great.
Phone battery is okay gives a days life. Face unlock is some times does nt happens we need to key in the passcode to unlock the phone.
Migrating data is simple from android to IOS. But migrating what's app data should be done through purchased 3rd part software. Phone consumes lots of internet compared to android. A decent phone got in discount through amazon. Amazon delivery is awesome. Customer care took my order on priority and pushed the delivery in matter of 2 days from order. Thank you Amazon team",5
2425,Dont buy any expensive products online and better buy from store or outlets,Purchased this phone only for camera...But it is not at all good...front camera pixels are poor specifically portrait mode. Don't buy apple phones online and better buy from Apple store. Even I complained about it in Service center but they started giving some fancy reason by saying that iPhones are made in three tone white Yello blue..and unluckily I got yellow one... that's why it's by default like this. Strange And stupid Reason...!!,2
2426,I got them nice and original,"Ordered 2 iPhone 11s. Was really scared because of all the negative reviews but took a leap of faith. Thankfully both my iPhones were original and seem to be okay. Really happy. I ordered one from Appario Retail and other from Darshita. One red, another purple. Happy with both.",5
2427,Excellent Quality,"Good battery back up with best features of apple. Camera much better than the previous models. The face lock option proves better as in case you are wering gloves also, the phone can unlock.",5
2428,Most awaited purchase - worth waiting for iPhone 11,"I had an iPhone 7 which I have used for 3+ Years and waiting an upgrade then I found this amazing sale on Amazon for Republic Day sale and immediately ordered product red 64 gb iPhone 11 in exchange with my old phone. I received it one day earlier than expected and It’s amazing .. I am impressed with the battery life, Face ID is very swift. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide is arguably the best in its class and is a lot of fun to shoot with. Night Mode is a welcome addition. its good for gaming as well. No lagging or latency while playing high graphic games. Th only disappointed is that the phone does not come with charging adaptor . we have to buy 18w or 20w charging adaptor for fast charging. USB cable supports fast charging with c type. Thanks to Amazon for such an amazing deal",5
2429,Iphone 11 pure class and style in your hand,"I am writing this review after using it for 7 days
I am a first time apple user
Battery life - Decent for 1 day use
Camera- excellent awesome
Display-though its 720p hd screen but the ratina display is awesome
Ios 13.5 latest ios version feel super fluid and snappy
Face recognition is top notch
Only con i found is the slow 5 watt charger that takes around 3.5 hours to fully charge
I am surpirised there are so many negative review from Amazon but trust me friend the material the quality the feel of iphone you get is super awesome ..
100% Genuine product..and thank you Amazon for such a great product and fast delivery",5
2430,Excellent Purchase at an excellent price,"Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker.
Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage.

Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020.
Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.

The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason.
But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue.",5
2431,Defective Screen,"Just opened up the brand new iPhone, after insertion is SIM card Got the call, whereupon got shocked to see that the screen is damaged from left side and there are grey/white spots as are visible on the screenshot taken by me. Customer care says we are helpless in exchanging the same since the Window of 7days has expired. It’s cheating, fraud and really unimaginable from the AMAZON.",1
2432,Good Quality phone from apple with some flaws,"I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:
1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.
2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.
3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don’t work in angles.
4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen
5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.
6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)
7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.",5
2433,Excellent iPhone 11. You can’t compare with other brands as Apple is Apple.,"It’s one of the most loved phone in the world. Excellent build quality. Great collaboration of software and hardware. Ultra high speed. Excellent camera. Extra ordinary security of personal data due to strict apple policy.

Price has been reduced drastically after launch of iPhone 12. What else you need in the phone?",5
2434,BLUFFED,They mentioned to provide earpods instead they gave earphones. I don't expect such catfishing from a renowned company apple to do such things. Not really happy to be honest and felt I would have switched to some other brand for the camera ughhh,2
2435,Good Product,At first glance product as expected but when it was received the packaging was worst. It was simply put in amazon plastic packet without any bubble wrapper or thermocal despite of pre paid of Half a lakh rupees. Amazon India must see into proper packaging system.,4
2436,Worst service from amazon,"I paid through Amazon hdfc credit card they mentioned bonus offer & instant discount, I contacted customer care they said it will be credited within 3 days, after 3 days I contacted again they said this product is not eligible for bonus offer.",4
2437,Ok but not Great.,"I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).

TL;Dr
Go for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.",3
2438,Well it’s an IPhone,"Didn’t expect much
Just wanted to have an IPhone
My oneplus7 is still a better phone than this but as I said it’s an IPhone",4
2439,The perfect phone does not ex......,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 The phone is amazing.
First of all, the battery backup is amazing and it can easily get you through a day of work very easily, i am a moderate user and with a screen time of around 5 to 6 hrs it lasts the whole day without any problems.
Second, the camera is awesome , pictures come out crisp and clear whatever be the time, night mode works like a gem, the balance it creates between the background and the subject is accurate . It does not over expose anything.
Next is the user experience, after coming from an android device i must say the user experience is very very good. Everything is smooth and crisp without any hiccups.
It is a perfect marriage of software and hardware taking you to a great experience.",5
2440,Damaged phone recieved from amzon,Don’t buy Apple product from amazon they provide faulty phone and they didn’t take it back in the return policy.,1
2441,Defective product and no support. Read this completely and never get fooled.,Never buy such costly products from amazon. They never return it back if the product is defective or even it’s not working. I brought this iPhone 11 and found there is a small foreign particle inside its display. Amazon asked me to get it checked in Apptronics and apptronics people are not even ready to touch the phone as it is not purchased from apple store. Now I’m using the same defective device. Got a good lesson- Never buy any product above 5000 from online shopping websites.,1
2442,Great Camera Great Battery & Not so great Display,"this is the best premium midrange phone, forget the Chinese brands they dont even come close to the build quality & experience Apple have, dont buy phones by comparing spec sheets iPhones are super well optimized gives the best experience, iOS is butter smootg & feels great, camera is unbeatable, battery life is strong the only negetive is the low refresh rate so instagram scrolling experience is really bad but lcd displays are much softer to the eyes ao u’ll strain less",5
2443,"Another Beauty From Apple, Such a Great Experience.","First of all, I was so scared and confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative reviews but still, I took a chance and I’m so glad that I made the right choice. I was upgraded from iPhone 7 and it was a great experience with all the latest specs and great battery performance. I have been using it for almost 2 months. There is nothing to question about quality or any kind of issue. I love this green colour as I wanted to go for some different color. Thanks to Amazon and Seller for providing the original product with great condition.",5
2444,After 3 months of use📱,"So here's the review after 3 months of use, this is by far the best phone i have ever used, this is my first iphone and the experience so far is truly amazing! The battery life is good, can last at most 8 hours with minimal usage and at least 6 hours with heavy usage! Although the charger is bit slow, takes almost 3 hours to charge the iPhone completely! The user interface is really smooth and if you are switching from android to ios, there's a huge difference! The camera quality is very impressive. The face id works really well. The speakers are great and earphones are durable ! You can go ahead and buy the product even now and won't regret it ♥️",5
2445,Go for it !,"Amazon did its work pretty well
The product was delivered one day prior
I was quite happy
Coming to the phone
I was an android user who currently shifted to iPhone 11 and IM TOTALLY LOVING IT
It's a whole new world for me
The camera is top notch
Face id recognition is above expectations
Everything is soo good
The only con of iPhone 11 is the battery life
It takes more than 2 hours to completely charge to 100% and it exhausts quickly as well
If this aspect of iphone 11 is taken care of by the apple store then there is no one that can beat iphone !!",5
2446,IPHONE 11 review for 10 days,"LIKES +
:Everything like a flagship
:Battery is awesome
:Responsive touch and charging is good even it is 5V
: performance is mind blowing

Dislikes
: so far i don’t have problems as a customer ; but i feel Amazon fba needs improvements in packing and handling as the box was having some dents such luckily didn’t damaged the box contents",5
2447,"Seller support not appreciated, or recommended","Product is good as it’s an apple product, not much satisfaction with the seller as I ordered ones the money was deducted from account, in two hrs time I got a msg that need to revise payment as they have some issue , so I did so , twice the amount was deducted and the support system for cancellation of one order is really disappointing, I got both the phone & found really different to return one .",5
2448,From 6S to 11,"My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.
package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it’s delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I’m the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there’s no question of sending refurbished device.
Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S. Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.
Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.
Overall it’s great to have this phone.",5
2449,Missing ipods with product,Online show ipods with this phone and delivered earphones...what is the reason behind this rubbish thing,1
2450,"Smooth UI, Great Cam, Love it!","User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.",5
2451,Worst purchase at this price,Product is Good but Battery gets zero within an hour after six months then I complained it in apple store They changed the battery They gaved it back to me after 10days But now I am facing this issue again but now its warrenty period is over So I have to spend thousands on its battery I think to buy out new Android smartphone rather than it battery So iphone is waste beacuse I can’t use it in my daily life,5
2452,Switching from Android to iOS ( And it’s actually Good ),"I had my doubts before buying iOS product because I’ve been using Android for a very long time, I’ve stock android experience so I know what kind of difference does it make from android to iOS.

- iOS is real smooth! If you go to the spec sheet of an Android even if you have 6GB or 8GB (not stock android) of RAM it’s gonna Hang at some point after accessing many apps.
- The phone heats up less as compared to normal Androids.
- The Sound quality of iPhones are immersive! Even if you’re not a big fan of listening to music or sounds on speaker you’ll still find a quality sound!
- About the camera, hats off to the sensors and AI. The picture quality in low light is too good and vibrant, the blacks do look like blacks (not a low contrast image), many of the colors bloom and it’s wonderful.
The Video have soo much better stabilisation and even you can switch from one lens to another while shooting. The quality is again the best out there.
Camera shutter is really fast and better. And clicks are responsive.
Though zoom quality is not that good but why you wanna zoom if you have a composed image.
- The Battery Life is quite nominal like it can work after a whole day usage. If your Screen time is around 5hrs 30mins it can go from 100 to 28-30%.
PS : Battery Saver works really well, can extend upto minutes of Battery Life.
- The Haptic touch is far better than the Androids. Feedback is really good.
- The shape is quite good handful! Curved edges does gives 2019 vibes but yeah the phone works pretty well in 2021.
- I agree that you gonna miss Android features but iPhone has it’s own resemblance. iOS have now comparable features as to android even some are better.

At the end I’d Recommend this. Even if you’re switching from iPhone 6S or 7, this might be your another jumpad! And to Android users yeah this device is worth the Money.",5
2453,As Expected..! Nice product,"Easy to handle and hassle free switch from old iPhone to new one (iPhone 11 64 GB Product Red)

2454,Disappointed with Amazon service,"So I bought iPhone 11 128GB variant. As expected of Amazon delivery was on time and product was in excellent condition.
But when I put sim inside and tried calling, distorted noice came through speaker.
Calling speaker is busted. Cannot hear clear voice unless you connect earpods and worst thing is there is no replacement policy for this. Only refund.
Did not expect such service from Amazon.Delivering faulty pieces.
Hope this didn't happen with other customers as well.",2
2455,The iPhone most folks should buy,"Good hardware at a decent price. The ios 14 is a good addition but no finger print scanner especially in such situations where masks are the new normal its stupid even with sophisticated ir systems for face unlock just dont sit right.
Other software and hardware performance are at par or better than many flagship androids but nothing out of the ordinary.
As far as Software features and customizability goes Android is the clear winner.The Apple software seems quite restricted in a way.

Overall a decent purchase.

Shipping and packaging were excellent by Amazon as always. So no issues there.",4
2456,amzon please take care in futuer...don't make people frustrated,Defective phone received after spent around 46k bucks .amzon people told i will get new phone within 48 hours but still I am waiting for the same.,1
2457,I have not got inside iPhone 11 box free EarPods with lightning connector,"I hav a bad review this time with Amazon I ordered iPhone 11 on 16th and delivered on 18th October Sunday, my complain is against order which was written in box EarPods with lightning connector I have not this item in box it was empty, I dint raised dowbt first bec wen it was delivered I was out of town by evening on same day, I returned back after 3 days but suddenly I came to know yesterday that in Amazon free EarPods was given then I chkd my box bec my Frnd came and Told me yes in my box also written same. So I called today customer care I was given horrible reason stating its passed 10 days but actual reason wen u took money ull don’t hesitate but then why now?. So now I have decided if Amazon will not return my free gift EarPods I will complain in consumer forrum bec I can’t keep quite now after knowing this, this is pattetic, horrible, once again I wil not keep quite.",1
2458,BEST PHONE OUT THERE!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Can't accept anything more from apple! Grabbed this beauty for 45000₹ during the Great Indian Festival! Worth every single penny paid! Go for it blindly over any other device! Best in the segment!",5
2459,Product was original but I have some doubts with its battery,"Writing this review after few months of usage
First of all Amazon did a great job in delivering this product within 2 days and the product was original and brand new.

The problem I observed in these few months of usage is that
1) my battery health is down to 95% now and this is weird as I don't use this phone heavily, nither I play any games in it.

2) reception of this phone is poor",3
2460,Received orginal iphone or clone iphone by this seller???,"After watching a video of youtuber name rapha.. I wanted to cancel the order initially but due to offer I compromised... But still a tension environment created in me, and I hope for the best... After watching several videos in youtube I checked my mobile A to z for finding any issue and originality.... By God grace I received original mobile....initially I noticed a warming after settings it's very very normal and cool. Super battery standby unbelievable literally.
The Updateing with a mobile hotspot will screws you better connect to orginal wifi for update. Picture quality superb as usual. I only prefer White color when it is apple... Seller is good... But next time I won't buy apple products in online. I don't want this tension atmosphere... Say no to online when it is apple..",5
2461,Amazon is trustworthy,I have received my iPhone 11 128GB black colour. My first online order for mobile and I was very worried that whether I would get the genuine product or not or may be they will send me defective damaged phone. There were so many doubts on my mind. But Iam a happy customer and Iam loving this iPhone. Thank you amazon and seller.,5
2462,Best awesome,"Battery life. Has been improved when. Compared to previous generations

Camera quality is good and pretty decent enough

Face recognition is bit fast and smooth
Overall build quality good enough
It’s been five months phone is working excellent no issues

Trust me you can close your eyes and invest and I suggest to club with spigen case so that you don’t have to worry about accidental damage",5
2463,❤️ FAST AND POWERFUL DEVICE ❤️,"I’m an iPhone user since 2016.So I’m familiar with the power they provide in the phone.I’m using this device for 5 days now.However iPhone 11 is also a beast.In my opinion BATTERY LIFE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER.
Battery: 4/5
Speed : 5/5(will handle every possible mobile tasks)
Camera : 4/5 (Falls a little behind in low light selfies)
Display : 3.5/5 (i know it’s LCD but Apple did a great job.You wouldn’t notice it that much)
I bought a 12 W charger separately.I wouldn’t recommend 18/20W charger as it’ll ruin your battery faster..12w is good enough.Dont use 5w it’ll take 3-3.5 hour to charge the phone.",4
2464,Stop Fooling Consumer! Not Earpod it's Earphone,"Stop fooling people by using marketing gimmick, Earpod and Airpod is same thing but wire earphone is completely different from Earpod. Product you are giving with iphone is earphone and not Earpod so do not market it as if you are providing Earpod. Stop fooling Consumer! :-(",1
2465,Apple now become smart seller,"Processor- till now only few applications I have downloaded and operated, but first time I have seen that now it’s very easy to download app in apple store & without charge(seems weird) ...in the times when fake phones are available & sold through same platform. Few applications struck during operation and I need to forcefully close it to come out of that app. It’s happening from first day....feels weird after spending 60k
Camera - it looks normal as compared what apple claims.
Headphones- poor quality, I have used I phone headphone in past & their quality is much better than what I have received. Wire quality is pathetic. Even Rs.700 senisser quality is much better.

Charger- similar to headphone they also seems pathetic, so thin & delicate that you will start doubting about their life.

Charging time- it took almost 3.5-4 hours tafri complete charge & just 2 hour to completely drained out if you are using in continuous.

Still I am looking for more clues so this phone feels me genuine & worth of my spending",3
2466,Loving it,I love this phone first time bought iPhone and very happy with camra quality -video and phot quality is just same like a good DSLR. I am a frequent traveler and have a good DSLR too..battery life is above the mark..go for it it’s worth,5
2467,Awesome phone,"One word - wonderful
Battery life - Very Good. Will take you through the day and to the next if you are an average user. Heavy users can rely on the battery for one full day. The phone doesn’t really heat up except while using some heavy apps (once in a while). But not bad at all.
The camera is great, as expected.
Face recognition is awesome. My phone recognises me even in the dark. And thankfully the phone recognises me and only me. Quite smart 😃
I have used the phone for over a month now.",5
2468,Apple I phone 11 Faulty devise stopping working exactly 2 weeks after purchase,Mobile is not catching the network exactly after 2 weeks. Now the worst thing is it stopped accessing the WiFi also. Changed the Sim done everything but the result is same. After spending the money on the best brand the product delivered is faulty one. Never expected this from Amazon.,1
2469,iPhone 11- my thoughts after 6months,"+Excellent snappy phone if you don’t look pixels through microscope as it’s not an OLEd panel
+ Good full day battery
+ excellent water and splash resistance coming handy during now in COVID
+ good main camera, low light is good as well, don’t use much of wise angle

-slow charge
-poor selfie camera
- wide phone unfriendly gripping
- slippery , use case
- back glass smudge game
- No hi res video support on YouTube
- pricy

If an iOS sticker get this device if not get One plus 8pro with lesser amount",4
2470,awesome I Phone,"You will fall in love with this phone ...fast , Sturdy ,Stylish ,elegant all at once

Camera is awesome

Battery life is good too ,it stays for more than a day

Only cons are following:

Purple colour is good but should have been 1 or 2 shades darker

Charger included is slow 5w charger and charges very slow 2.5 hours for full cahrge , you will have to buy separate fast charger",4
2471,Overrated!!,"I was much happy with my iPhone 7 than this. The bluetooth keeps disconnecting by itself. Wrote to Apple support, got to know its a common problem faced by many. Apple did not care to respond. Battery life is still crappy. Thats why they are offering bluetooth airpods for free because the phone will always be connected to the charger. Doesnt last even a day of usage if its towards the higher side. Touch, camera, speakers, screen are all fine, but overall you expect better in this range. Yes the apple logo looks good too..",3
2472,Go for it. No second thoughts..,"Have been using the phone from 20th oct 2020 and I feel no regrets.
Camera quality is really good, battery back up as well..
5w adapter charges the phone very slow (4hrs max)
Sound quality, Speed: Good
Overall you can rely on this phone.
A good to go phone 😊",4
2473,Very Nice iPhone11,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Very Nice iPhone11 with 128gb, really awesome photos and videos. Battery life perfomance also well its comfortably run one and half day. Phone is slightly heavy in weight wise, but when you its in your hand, you forget the weight. Handsome and really nice look in black color.

I am uploading some photos taken by iPhone11 and a video for the zoom testing in video mode, shot in 4k.

Also nice Amazon.in delivery, got in after just 24 hrs. Nice Job TEAM Amazon.in

Thanks & Regards

2474,Good iphone,If you are going for yellow colour don't expect a bright yellow rather it's a pale yellow... Battery life is good... Very slim phone indeed... Best camera... Great low-light image's,5
2475,Refurbished product sold by sellers,"Review here just pertains to the product I've received from Amazon. Guys, some sellers are misleading customers with refurbished products. The one I received had certain issues with speaker and camera and Amazon was not agreeing to replace the same. But did ask me to return the product and get the return instead.

Please be very careful while purchasing such costly products from Amazon. It is always advisable to buy it from istore because it is no 10-12k that you are investing.",1
2476,Microphone not working,I bought mobile 9 days ago and i Don't know how but the microphone hasn't been working since yesterday i have chatted with apple support they give me some instructions and i have followed it but they didn't work,1
2477,New i phone asking for passcode. Got used product,"Got used product. Very much fed up right now
When i stared it. It was asking for passcode",1
2478,Nice phone. Worth the premium paid for this phone.,"Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.

The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.

I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.

Thanks.",5
2479,Thank you amazon- Super amazing phone with proper delivery 🥰,"🔹First of all Thank you so much Amazon😇 for keeping up customer satisfaction on top.
🔸Phone is no doubt- Super amazing. Nothing can beat this. In terms of Battery, camera, performance, body, display- everything is superb. You will definetly get a different feel while using this phone and carrying with you. Must buy 😍
🔹Initially i was bit scared for delivery of product when i ordered this phone. But seller - "" Darshita Electronics "" delivered it in a very precise way. Proper packing, sealed and safely delivered to me without any cons. Thank you Darshita Electronics.",5
2480,"Dont Buy, Waste of money","No need to buy An I Phone.
U can buy 3 better Phones in the price of one IPhone..
It is just a show of , just a brand nothing more than that.. nothng special in the phone. I ambusing I phone since one year.. just regretting my decision to buy it.. My Redmi Note 8 pro is much better than I phone.. better bettry life , fast charging , better camera, better short cuts, easy to use and 1/3 price as compare to I phone 11",3
2481,Good product but lame packaging.,"The product is very good, color is also good no issue with the device till now as its only a day of usage, but this time i am not satisfied with the package as per amount paid for the premium product. I ordered 3 item but they sent it all together in a single box which is not acceptable. What would have happended if the product received turnsout a damaged one, i know there is a policy of replacing but it was a birthday gift, had to send back and had to wait for extra more days. Many a times i have received a serum with proper packaging with bubble wrap but the iphone came with a lame packaging. Overall happy with the product.",4
2482,Genuine product,"After reading so many reviews on Amazon that Apple phone should not be purchased through Amazon, I bought this mobile but trust me. I got genuine product. Battery health was 100%
I checked everything. All is well. Thank you Amazon",5
2483,Didn’t Receive cashback of1250.,"Booked product on 16th October with HDFC credit card but didn’t receive cashback of 1250 and the worst part is when I tried to claim cashback Amazon Executive told me that there was no such offer but luckily I had screenshot of offers campaign so I showed them then they said that cashback was not applicable on iPhones but luckily a acquaintance of mine had ordered iPhone on same day with HDFC credit card and he got cashback also. So have complaint again for the same. Hope I get cashback this time.
Coming to iPhone 11
The phone is working superb. Checked all the accessories.",4
2484,Definitely worth it..,"I've recently made a switch from the Android ecosystem to iOS. I'm totally in love with the smoothness of the UI the iPhone 11 provides. The studio light feature in the camera is supreme for portraits. Battery life is mediocre as I was using OnePlus phone before this one but the build quality is excellent. If you're even tad bit confused on whether or not it is a great buy, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the price. Also, the delivery was smooth and hassle free.",5
2485,Genuine phone,Thank you amazon for deleivering this phone before time within 24 hrs. I am completely satisfied with this phone i was so scared after seeing so many negative comments but yeah this is truely genuine phone.,5

PRO- Handy
Face unlock is nexy level works like some science fiction stuff
white color and aluminum finish looks dope
Battery life is also great
Phone Speakers are loud enough
Call quality & internet speed is amazing specially where network is weak or something
CON-
Display (it's just 720p LCD Display) but again quality is top notch",5

2488,Amazing phone . Loved it,"I was using iphone 7 for 3.5 years and it was finally time to upgrade.
Looking at price of iphone 12 . It was not possible to buy such an expensive phone.
Thanks to great indian festival by amazon got this beauty at 45k.
Very delighted by asthetics and performance.
Although battery life is still an issue I get 1 n half day with regular usage. I doubt over the years it will degrade.
Camera is superb. Screen is better than my previous phone so works for me.
If you want iphone go for this.
Otherwise s20plus is good alterantives",5
2489,Suhail Kareem,iPhones are always the best. But it depends on your usage when it comes to battery backup. iPhone 11 is the best ever phone I have used till date. It has the best battery of 3110 and gives the user a full day usage with enabling mobile data on all the day. You can still buy the iPhone 11 even after the launch of iPhone 12 when you need a good battery backup.,5
2490,It's an iPhone,"Before this I was confused in what android to buy, camera quality, ram etc etc and then I decided to get my first iPhone. and trust me just the best decision. Camera blows anything out of the water it's that good. Performance is the best of all time. battery life is amazing as I am constantly getting 30% at the end of the day even after 6-7 hours of screen on time. Also the delivery was also very fast got it in two days only even in peak sale time",5

2492,IPhone11 - value for money,"iPhone11 is my second apple product which I purchased recently after iPad Air and as I am pretty happy with iPad I really felt of switching to iPhone from android. iPhone11 is absolutely working fine for me and the battery lasts longer, Face ID to irks very fast and the apps do respond quickly even with 10 or more apps in open. The Face ID which is being used to login to apps work perfectly and I could open locked mobile or the apps very much conveniently. A little bit of heat happens to occur when I charge the mobile but that’s normal not to the extreme . I am happy with the product… I continue to go with Apple products going further. It’s value for the money …",5
2493,The iPhone,"I got this phone in amazon great Indian sale under 50k. This phone is September 2020 manufactured (China).

The phone is super awesome, Yet Discovering a lot of things about it, Installing Third-Party Apps, Using Siri and Shortcuts is Super Cool. Definitely Gets Heat up as I heard a lot about 11 series Phone before buying, yet it has decreased my usage of the phone for very lesser, the way I used to use my previous Redmi Note 5 Pro, receive only relevant Notifications only, No unnecessarily things, So I am Happy to be an iOS user finally, though there is a lot of bondation in apple CZ of security reasons, Yeah I am happy with it (Shows Ameeri, Lol). Delivery was Good, took around 5 days to deliver, but still delivered it before expected Date of arrival.",5
2496,Smartphone good for content creation. worst for watching content.,"1. Camera is great
2. Display quality is below average for watching content. Youtube, facebook and instagram videos look blurry all the time. If u r coming from nokia 1100 only then u may like this display.
3. Gaming performance is awesome.
4. It has one day battery. Does not matter how intense user you are.
5. Camera quality is also great.
In simple words this smartphone is good for content creation becoz of its camera but worst for content watching on social media. Mark my words. Poor display.",3
2497,Go for it 🥳,"This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get(Bought in amazon sale) for this price. I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving. Think twice if you’re making switch from android, coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you’ll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except. It gives you 1 and half to two days of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you’ll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months.",5
2498,I want exchange this product,"I got the phone today .
But having some scratch on rear camera panel
I have attached photo and unboxing video",3
2499,Great value for money,"it was just an awesome purchase for me, because this is the handset which iam looking for ever since it was launched, the only thin that bothers me was its hefty pricing, but fortunately with this amazon's great indian festival off, i could able to buy it in my budget price, since iam an iphone user i dont have anything to say about its features and specs, the thing is, if anyone wants to upgrade their mobile and who uses it for a quiet bit longer years then they should definitely go for this device without any doubt.",5
2500,Don't Buy Poor Quality - You'll disappoint,"Don't Buy Poor Quality - You'll disappoint
Let me tell you why -
Manufacturing is old
LCD display as compared to Pro and other models
Sound Quality Issue
Apple is discontinuing it as well",1
2501,For the first time IPhone Buyers,"Got it for an amazing deal, Thank you Amazon.

This is my first iPhone and it’s damn good. Had seen some reviews saying that the screen is not good, but let me tell you guys that this is the best LCD screen you’ll ever get in an phone. The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it. And Apple operating system is holding up good and their Face ID is damn fast.
I need not comment on the camera quality as it is among the best mobile camera that is available at this price range. I will post some pics clicked by the camera for reference.
Talking about the battery life, it is kinda decent will last you easily for a day with more than moderate usage.

Would highly recommend this if you are planning to buy your first iPhone.",5
2502,Better than Android,"This one is a no brainer, I have been using Samsung flagship for almost 4 years and I'd just feel much smoother thanks to A13. Surprisingly this has been a very good experience considering I thought I would feel like a prisoner in Apple e. Whatever you can do in android you can do it here, it's just that there is a long and tiring process to do it. Definitely recommended you won't regret buying this.",5
2503,New look Lovely,Very very addictive new iPhone,5
2504,Best phone you can buy,"I switched to iphone from oneplus 8 pro , i have been an oneplus user since 3t, but 8 pro was so bad and full of problems so i finally decided to switch to iphone and literally this is so much better than 8 pro , 8 pro was just marketing . Even the screen on this phone is better than the 8pro . This phone is a beast in every department . I purchased it only because of amazon sale at 48,000 i am really glad for the sale otherwise the price was too high",5
2505,Best Buy,"So I got my hands on this beautiful purple iPhone 11 and it feels amazing.

I upgraded from iPhone 8 to 11 and tbh the 3 year old iPhone 8 is still in the best condition .

This is what makes me go for iPhone again and again .

I’ve had android in the past and the thing that keeps me loyal to iPhone is that it gives me ZERO LAG and the BEST PICTURE QUALITY.",5
2506,"Worth it, Here's why :-","Pros

Battery
WiFi 6 and Gigabit class LTE
Camera
OS stability and optimization
Performance
Wireless Charging (7.5W)
Software support likely 5 years +

Cons.
Screen resolution, Lacks HDR support (notch is not big issue now)
lacks some basic functions as android

Verdict:
If you want to invest in premium built quality, privacy and super fluid performance without heating or lagging issues of android, this is a good option.

NOTE:
Buy a 18W charger (Anker, Apple, RAVpower,etc brands) and a spigen tempered glass combo
worth it!",5
2507,Invest for a Long term👌😍,..Life review after 1 year of daily use. Its a long term investment.. A phone for many years. If you are changing your phone every year don't invest high on this... If you love❤ it.. Will go with you years. 😍. Remember..But it's not too light 198+with your back cover 220+..camera 5 ⭐. Never compare it's photo📷 quality with any mid range phone.. It's above any 64mp camera. 👌👌👌,5
2508,Switched from a 6S,"Not much has changed. Apple has similar products but then obviously the bigger screen, better front camera and better battery life make it feel like an upgrade. The phone speaker is amazing and LOUD, especially compared to 6S. Rear camera is almost similar to 6S. But overall, I really like the phone. The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you’re a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.",5
2509,Awesome phone..,"I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone.",5
2510,Worth the wait!!,"Perfect product received, I ordered this phone on 16th October and after seeing videos on YouTube people claiming that they are receiving fake iPhones, I was scared to death. As this is my first iPhone and I have recently shifted from android to iOS, but thank you amazon for delivering the best product possible. The only grievance I had was of the delivery because I received it in a time span of 13 days. Took too long to deliver.. but it was worth the wait!!!! I love my iPhone 😍😍 and the delivery guy was so good that he told me to unbox the phone infront of him so that if there is any defect he could sort it out then and there itself. I couldn’t be more happier!!!!",5

2512,Battery doesn’t deserve a 5W charger. Awful !!!,"The 5W charger is really a pain....don’t know why Apple is providing it.It’s’ staking more than 3.5 hrs to charge the iPhone full and the adapter is getting extremely heated after 30 mins or so.
YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BUY AN 18W C CHARGER PLUS C CABLE if u want to get rid of this battery issue and be ready to shed an extra 5k.
Rest I found an issue with the MEASURE app from the utilities section which makes the iPhone getting heated instantly within minutes of use.
Anyone having the same issues ??suggestions are most welcome.",4
2513,front camera quality is worst,"Updating my review after 6 months of use
Pros:
1. Device performance is commendable
2. Primary Cameras are up to the mark
3. Battery backup is fair enough, lasts for whole day even after extensive usage (screen time up to 7 hours)

Cons:
Front camera quality is so cheap, takes good picture only in day or full light exposure outside, indoor pictures are too grainy and noisy, dis not expect this cheap quality camera from Apple, even MI budget phones have better front camera than iPhone 11",3
2514,"Priced drop,, but no 5g :(","Excellent phone,, just don't go on some previous old comments in review section, they are just trying to ruin amazon's trust, I received the phone in Excellent condition,, checked imei and model no. during un boxing, it was OK, looks great in hand, just one thing you might regret in 2021 is that if 5g fully arrives at India you just cannot enjoy its features,, although you will have to go for iphone 12 which is a way more costly,, so its better if you buy 11 becoz it's only 52k,,the choice is yours",5

 Happy Apple customer. Buying an apple product is always amazing. I have been with apple since 2019 and till now very satisfied with their services. Bought an Imac last year which works absolutely fine and then from android moved onto iphone and really loved the apple experience. Started from apple Iphone 7 and then recently moved onto iphone 11. Thanks alot Amazon for delivering quality and original products.",5
2517,Battery backup is worst. That is the big problem with iPhone.,I like apple product but battery is worst. Sometime I thought I have to move on good android who has a huge battery life.,3
2518,RECEIVED USED I PHONE NO ACCESSORIES,I received used I phone and no accessories Iphone already Installed glass i am see after shocked and trying to start i phone but Iphone not started after i go near shop after I phone start i am shocked so much no accessories it’s ok but why send used I phone.,3
2519,Functional or not,"A defective phone is delivered, struggling to get it replaced..NO help from anyone..either the seller or apple",1
2520,Great phone by iphone,"Its best phone i've seen from iphone lineup till 2019. the experience is tremendous. This is my first iphone and very happy with product.. Best Camera, Best RAM management, Best battery life but disappointed with LCD screen, OLED would be there and hopefully when I bought i got earphones and charger :-) LOL",5
2521,Within one month Ringer button problem,My mobile is just 1 month old ...Now I got ringer button problem please don’t purchase iPhone mobiles in online .. some manufacturing defect mobiles they are easily selling via online ... completely dissatisfied... now my mobile is in service center,1
2522,Charger and battery is not quite satisfying.,It takes 4hours to charge and 5-6hours running time. Present time nobody can wait 4hours just to charge a phone on airplane mode otherwise bot phone and charger can overheat. Not so satisfying charger and battery. So many brands are far ahead in the same price. Color is light lemony instead of yellow.,2
2523,Iphone dead and not turning on,It has been one and a half months and my phone was okay till today afternoon when it suddenly died and I am not able to turn it on in any manner. We are under lockdown and I can't even access any service centre. Would appreciate if Amazon or the seller can arrange for a call from the apple technician who can fix this.,1
2524,Very bad,This is very bad experience in product mentioned with Ear pods but on box no ear pods...I'll complaint for this but no action taken by Amazon n team..I'll have the video and screen shot and go in consumer forum for the mislead...,1
2525,Great phone with mind blowing performance,"The phone is awesome and delivered the performance as expected.

Bought it on Amazon great Indian festival but they not provided the Cashback offers as promised on the phone when I made the purchase.

The Amazon changed the offer for iPhone after 2 days of sale and now they denying to provide the Cashback amount.

Should have bought from somewhere else.",5
2526,Amazon + Apple = Trust + Quality,"I am writing against all the negative reviews here. I have purchased iPhone 11 from Amazon sale on 23rd of Oct. If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.",5
2527,"Excellent as expected, but product assembled in India is bonus!","Ordered on prime day of Amazon Great indian Festival, Oct 16th, 2020. Charger and earpods included in box. Delivered in 3 days, kudos to Amazon! Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)",5
2528,Defective iPhone 11 to cheat customer,I restored my new iPhone 11 I ordered from amazon. After a while it stopped responding. It was frustrating that touch screen is not working and I wanted to delete data which I restored from iTunes but I the instrument was not responding at all.i guess amazon sent me very old and defective pice for what? As I bought it on EMI I had to ask for replacement other wise I would have canceled it.,1
2529,M not sure,M skeptical abt this product. Idk whether it is a brand new or refurbished. I have experience the heating issue after 10 mins or while i aas setting up the device. Since it is an expensive device n not sure it will b good to return or keep it,4
2530,"APPLE is APPLE, Good choice for 50K","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 There is nothing extraordinary or something like that with the iphone compare to overall flagship android device i have been using, but the ecosystem & the iOS experience is kind of different & fluid and it's a good experience to have a Apple Device for first time. Worth for around 50k, glad i didn't go with the 85k iphone-12 not much a difference according to my usage. Battery is more than i expected, Camera quality is great when it comes to video recording, photos aren't that great.",5
2531,Upgraded from iPhone 6.,"For me, its best at this price point. Upgraded from iPhone 6. Adequately fast and smooth with all day long battery life.
Only disappointment was made the packaging, seller has just pack it into a polythene bag instead use of cardboard box for safety purposes of device and box as well. Box found damaged but device fount okay.",5
2532,"Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White (Includes EarPods, Power Adapter)",I got the product today but the earpod is missing. What can I do now?,1
2533,Brand new phone not a refurbished or clone and works extraordinarily .,"Amazon has full-filled my wish, For an iPhone 11 beyond my expectations! I was a bit concerned until my order arrived . But once it was within hand i felt relaxed . As the product is brand new and also there is nthg to worry abt the damage plus it also has 1 year apple warranty ! . In short i would rate amazon 5/5 for delivery on time and with all safety precautions.",5

Dual sim(esim) esim just a failure, bcz if you try to use dual sim option, esim always plays tricks with you like it goes offline & shows NO SERVICE, at the end of the day Iphone is just for single SIM..!🤣🤦🏻‍♂️",5
2535,Most value for money iphone in 2021!,Reviewing after 4 days of heavy usage. A bit warm on the back after heavy usage such as gaming but its bearable. Phone is very snappy and camera is just gorgeous. This is the best iphone one can get in 2021.,5
2536,Review after 7 months,My review after 7 months of use ... battery health at 96%... that is mostly because I use a fast charger now and then else the health would have been at ~98%... yes the phone heats up at load and when plugged even interaction with the phone is hard as the temp go crazy ... never was concerned about the storage as I use cloud ... it’s fine ... will update his post later a year ... I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...,3
2537,Good,"Its my first iphone. Overall experience is good.
The only thing that hurts is that apple no longer provide adapter and headphones. I did not know that while placing order. In the box , we get iphone, charging cable and sim tray eject pin.

After setting up phone, look for software update. I got it upgraded to latest version.

The phone gets heated when on charging , otherwise it remains cool.",4
2538,Best but Amazon ruined it ;(,"Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.
It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.
To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.
To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!
So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.
It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.
Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.
You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.
The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.
Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.
So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.
And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!",4
2539,Positive As Well As Negative,"Amazing Purchase fir Rs.55000 oct 2020

Screen and Display
Earpods+Charger

Negative:-
Going Back ⬅️ Option In Corner is a bad one
(Sometimes finger misses it terribly).
No gesture in Bottom(Back,Recent,Home)",5
2540,Bang for the bucks,"Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it.
The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone.",5
2541,Apple always amazing,No fingerprint,5
2542,The most perfect Apple iPhone today. No doubt.,"This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage. The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.
The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.",5
2543,Simply Wow,"An awesome phone from Apple. Worth buying!
Camera Quality is undoubtably the best in outdoor ! Indoor seems to be good, not great.

Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.

iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!

White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.",5
2544,Best Iphone version ever,"Honest review after using 2 months.
Its the best Iphone version I have ever used.
Everything is superb

I loved it.
And thank you so so much Amazon and the seller as well.
Loved it Amazon ❤️",5
2545,Great product and happy to grab this during sale,"iPhones are best in class and performance of any iPhone is just excellent. If you ignore the price tag (although I bought this iPhone 11, 128gb during the shopping festival on Amazon), iPhones are the best mobile phones on this planet. Great performance, great battery life, great camera and a great iOS.
Well about this iPhone 11 everything is just great and I am happy to have one.",5
2546,"Perfect product ,Amazing delivery.","The product was delivered before the said the date which was wonderful as i was super excited . I have ready many bad reviews for the product and was afraid of the same but got it without any defects and its working as expected . I got my 128 gb at a good price on the big billion day.

There was no hassle in the exchange as i have opted for it by giving my old iphone 7 for this one and the executive was professional where my phone had a scratch on the body but they have taken it as the screen was clear and perfect.",5
2547,Dope deal .. grab it ASAP,"Best deal on iPhone ever I guess..
Pros :
Best camera , even low light photography is good

Buttery smooth performance ( people talking about 90 Hertz / 120 Hertz refresh rate on androids, it's far better than those), androids I don't think can match apple's ecosystem anyday..

Battery performance is a big upgrade over previous models like xr , X's etc.. can get u a day easily.

No lags no glitches

Cons

But heavy
Display is not OLED like s20 plus etc

Getting it for 46200₹ was the best online purchase I ever did..no regrets
Worth every penny.. Thanks apple and Amazon for this wonderful product..",5
2548,Android to IOS,"Well I am first time iphone user and yes it's very annoying if u r android user for first few days and ofcourse u will not regret buying IOS.
Over all building quality is top notch,camera is excellent. And battery backup is also good for regular usage and don't play games on it. Yes daily usage such as fb,insta,net surfing will not consume much battery I charge battery after 2 days when its gets completely discharge and annoying is charging takes around 3 hrs to full as it comes with 5V chargers.Rest everything is nice",5
2549,Not authorised seller as per Apple do not purchase,"Bought the the phone only a couple of days ago and got a grey line on the display, checked on amazon for replacement suggests us to contact apple, after a two hour chat with Apple they stated that this seller is not an authorised apple seller. Neith Amazon or the seller takes responsibility. You rather pay the extra 3 thousand and buy it from Apple directly. As per Apple this was purchased in Japan.",1
2550,Good phone regular usage,"I bought iPhone 64 gb black after lot of research and confusion from all the products in the market.
This product I got at 48500 rs.
I had lot of concerns regarding the seller.
But, surprisingly the phone is genuine I checked the warranty and other details everything is good.

Using the phone since few days(I don’t play any games).
pros
1) Amazon delivered it a day ahead of the actual delivery date. The delivery was excellent.

2) Very efficient battery after one full charge it lasted almost a day after mild use and no battery heating issue as of now.

3) voice quality of the calls is very good. Better than the android phone that I used before.

4) picture quality from this phone camera is excellent.

Cons
1) moving from android to apple data transfer is a bit of hassle.
2) display is a little bit low compared to iphone12 mini ( which I had originally planned to buy)
3) no charger adapter( big con for me moving from android to iPhone)

it’s a good buy for the regular usage a very solid looking good phone.",5

Pros :
Flawless UI
Best performance with Great Battery Life
No lag between switching of apps
Great buy if u want to switch to IOS with best price now
Camera quality during day light is excellent.
No ads like other chinese vendor.

Cons :
Camera quality during low light needs to be improved i.e in artificial lighting.
Charging with 5w charger is very slow in todays era . It will almost take 3hrs to full charge from 0 to 100%",5

2554,Awesome 👌,"Fantastic phone with lots of amazing features, a perfect buy. Bought this I Phone 11 after using Samsung M 30 for a while.

This is my home pic taken with (0.5x) camera option, it covered flooring to ceiling, really crazy with this. Remaining all features are TOP. I booked this phone in Amazon from Appario Retail Private Ltd (seller). He delivered my phone in on time. iPhone 11 is Little bit expensive but great selection from iphone. Thankyou, RK",5
2557,Great buy....with cost reduction and offers,"I was bit worried to order iPhone 11 online but got good experience....as if you see few customers have got worst experience from online buy of iPhones

Battery and display not that great as in 50k you will get better battery and display phone
Vs android apps download and installation time is more I observed in iOS

Other than this the best face unlock, very convenient user experience, hustle free wireless charging, 6.1 screen great fit in hand. No hang and bug like android phones (I am android user since ages). Overall best package as its iPhone and live up to the expectations. In comparison with new iPhone 12 in terms of cost iPhone 11 is great value for money. works just Amazing.",5

2559,Great pick for dual sim users who are obsessed with getting good pictures!,"The delivery got delayed by a day but the product came with good packaging and I have verified the product on Apple website to ensure that the product is genuine.
Jio and Airtel offer esim in India, so be mindful when you read that iPhone supports dual sim. It supports one esim and one nano sim.
Great camera. Bulkier than other older iPhone models. Display and sound quality is amazing!",5
2560,Pics are quite yellow,"I don't know why but the pics are quite yellow and due to that I have not yet put sim in my i phone, it will be a month on 28th Feb. I m confused if its real or fake. I can't even return it since its getting a month in few days. I have two small kids that's why didn't get much time to explore and feeling disappointed now.
Can someone connect with me from amazon.",3
2561,Must buy with Hdfc offer + no cost emi total discount 8.1k,No complaints yet awesome mobile loved night mode camera,5
2562,Very Poor glass quality for iPhone 11 as compared to the older versions..,experience is great for now.. however another feedback is that within 20 days I noticed a tiny crack like a hair on my iPhone 11.. Honestly it has not fallen yet although my previous iPhone 6s survived many drops with no cracks at all even after 4 years.. strange and surprising that the glass quality is very bad as compared to the old phones,5
2563,Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.
If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.
Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !",4
2564,Excellent!!,"Overall phone is excellent. You can go for it.

But one suggestion to all, don't buy any products using Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card, you will be charged nicely. That too if you are choosing NO EMI COST option then gone case, get ready to pay extra charges including interest charges and GST against each installments and products. Whatever they show in calculation details (Structure) all bullshit. I nicely charged for this product by selecting EMI option and just to save 1000/- I paid extra 2000/- for this product.

And I purchased one more product 'Hoodie' the cost was 799/- by using Amazon Pay ICICI Card it costed for me 942.82 including GST even though it was a one payment.

So my sincere suggest don't use *Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card at all*. And don't go for any EMI options its better to buy in one payment to avoid additional charges. No body will help you once it is charged to you. ICICI Customer care they play very safe game.",5
2565,A good phone,Good one..actually i was very frustrated when i order because most of the comments where discouraging and i became very tensed...but after receiving the package i am really happy because it is the best and i qm really happy about the product..😍 i was using iphone 6 and now updated to iphone 11 so comparing with iphone 6 verything is best according to me..camera quality battery life everything...go forward for this and all the best...,5
2566,Experience the beauty..,"I am an android user before and this is my first ios device. Before i wondered why people are spending their huge money to buy it, but now i realised why, let me tell u..

Camera:
Better in bright light conditions.. but it is not upto the mark in low light or night conditions..

Battery:
Which is best and lasts whole day with above avg usage

The functionality and apps handling is flawless and i can say that no one gonna regret by choosing this phone..
My mobile was iphone 11 64 GB
And i would like to thank AMAZON for great delivery on time and at this situation as we get so many fake or clone iPhones which i was bothering about.. but AMAZON did a great job and got a brand new original iphone!
Thank you and go for it....",4
2567,Awesome!,"Upgrade to 11 from 7 was smooth as the data transfer took place in just a few minutes. Features of iOS14 and the battery backup are simply superb. However, since the adapter supplied is of 2W, the charging time is higher. May be wireless charger or 5W charger should be bought separately",5
2568,"I am in eligible of return policy, so make my request to return my order","I want to return mobile which is ordered on 21st july 2020 and delivered on 26th July, because battery life drains quickly, while charging mobile was heating, didn’t have external memory card, app like true caller were not responding properly, mobile is locked with my own Face ID even it is unlocking with my brother’s face.",3
2569,Great experience,"Using since 20 days
Great battery back up compared to all other cells and last for 2 days without charging as per normal use and 24 hours with continuous use.
Camera as always best one with portrait mode going good.
There should be more options in photo editing like text and other useful tool so we don’t have to use third party app.

Overall great experience",4

2572,"Good product,but there are things to improve.","Battery life drains faster, camera sometimes looks grainy. It has significant weight to it.
Even though the screen is lcd, it is very good..no problem there.
As a person coming from android background there are somethings I really,like for example the notifications are not arranged intuitively, if you download any docs or photo there is no indication that it is completed.
Overall a good product to buy.",4
2573,Amazing phone from apple,"One of the amazing phone from apple. Insane pic quality. Improved battery life, face recognition is way faster than its previous ones. Amature photographers will like it for sure :).

Overall experience is good enough.",5
2574,Worried about the weight,Everything is great as it’s supposed to be but for some reason this phone is heavier than my friend’s iPhone 11 bought in the US,5
2575,Left OnePlus for the first time,"Readers,
Earlier I was hesitant to buy an iPhone as 11 comes with LCD panel, I used to be a huge fan of OnePlus and was under the impression that 120 Hz would really make a difference but hands on heart- I’ve been using my iPhone for last 3 days and I am flabbergasted at how vivid the display of iPhone is that too LCD one!

Now coming to delivery- Amazon never disappoints

Seller- Appario Retail, received the original product and in good condition- No complaints. IDK why other users have issues with this retailer

Deal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sure

Don’t worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the market

Colour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for me

The only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can’t transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device.

Hope my review helps in decision making!",5
2576,🔥🔥🔥,First time buy a phone from Amazon littlebit confused should I buy from online or from shop . But after receiving phone 📱 I am satisfied with the product. I already have a I phone 11 the performance of the phone is superb. Thanks Amazon for safe delivery 👍👍👍,5

I would like to tell that as I switched from an Android to iOS, there is a very big change that I am experiencing. Camera quality, call clarity, every single aspect of the device is top notch.

2582,Honest review why should you buy this.🙂,"As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in 📷 competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options. Like that in INDIA didn't expect 5G till 2023 so that's why.

Thank you 😊

2583,Good phone and early delivery,"Genuine product
Came with ear-pods adaptor and charging cable
Delivered much earlier than expected
I was also sceptical seeing some negative reviews but still went ahead and placed the order and i am really happy that i did that
Its a wonderful phone
Its my second iphone and the upgrade is super awesome...",5
2584,Happy Customer,"I used to have iPhone 6 earlier and actually i was not at all happy with the battery life, so after going through many reviews purchased iPhone 11 in the month of October during the sale.. i must say i am quite impressed with the battery life, i mostly use social networking sites, and do normal gaming it gives a screen on time of 6 to 7 hours. Night mode works so good, the face lock responds quick even in the dark. So after using for 7 months i can say that the money didn’t go in vain",5
2585,"Poor product, in 2months there is proximity sensor issue and display issue","In just 2months issue with proximity sensor and also a spot came up on the display. Given for service, dont know what theory they will come upon with. One thing i didnt like that the service centre guys are not giving clear explanation of the issue. Didnt expect such poor product from apple.",1
2586,not worth for money,"lots of bugs in this mobile .. networks goes while calling , internet not works most of time .. face id is not as good as it should be .. and as i said about network issues , it is only with this hand set .. as one of my friend purchased same phone and he is also facing same issues ..",2
2587,It is the best. Ignore fake reviews,I love this phone. It is best phone in this range. This is my 3rd iphone after 5s and 6. I feel so good. Camera quality is awesome. Battery is also good. You need to charge once in a day. Don’t go with negative reviews. I have made one unboxing video as well. You can watch the video on my YouTube channel Kunwar The Fitness King. Go for it.,5
2588,Love the feeling of iOS,"This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone. The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android. And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can’t beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.",4
2589,Totally worth it,I am one plus user for past 3 years was kinda bored of android wanted to shift to iOS. This phone is totally worth it and has a very premium experience . Although s20 fe was available at the same range i purchased this phone. If you are looking to buy it you should go for it without hesitation.,5
2590,Perfect 👍👍👍,Bought it for my son for birthday gift. Perfect product. Checked genuineness from the menu and it was original with one year warranty activated with today’s date. Was little worried with few of the reviews about the seller. But very satisfied as bought on Apple days which gave a discount of 5400 /-,5
2591,Better buy from apple store,"i got the guanine device no issues it now its working as per standards , but during the sale days when i made purchase there were lot customers complained online that they got fake phone on package with solid proofs so to avoid these kind of complex situation its better to buy it from apple store . in my case everything went fine delivered on time , to be on safer side better record a video while opening the package.",3
2592,Mobile weight is more than its standard weight,Mobile weight is exceeding 194 grm as per standard weight of device. Its observed 199 grm. Don’t know the reason behind this. Please check the weight of your device after unboxing. My other iphone 11 which is 128 gb variant has 194.5 gram weight.,3
2593,Good,We are fan ok apple 🍎 we love tge product,4
2594,Amazing cellphone.. value for money 👍😎,Super cool device.. delivered today early in the morning..,5
2595,Best iPhone,I was an iPhone 7 user earlier. I switched to this 11 after my old phone broke. It is a superb experience while using it. Specially when you upgrade from old iPhone to this iPhone 11. The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Otherwise best phone in market.,5

2597,DON'T BUY IPHONE 11 BEFORE READING MY REVIEW,"i brought it in 50k 128 GB verient in sale
(53k bill - 1750 hdfc instant discount - 1250 amezon cashback = 50k)

but after using 5 days I'll sell this in 48k
coz i couldn't fit Apple IOS ecosystem

because in apple u can't download free Premium apps from safari easily like crome .
for me editing & many other small day to day life things ( like downloading of INSTA , WP , FB , TWITTER posts , sometimes Call recordings , using of otg pendrives ) which u can easily done android compare to ios .

after purchasing 11 , in just 5days am realising that am Android kida 🐛😂 & i sell my iphone 11 in 48 k (2k loss😂) now am going for onePlus ( android again )

now am telling my 5 days EXPERIENCE -

Performance - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Camera(both) -⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Battery - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (i just changed 3 times in 5days but apple 5w charger takes 3 hr for 💯 full charge but backup is good

Display (60hz LCD pannel display) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Stereo speakers - Awesome ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

if u reading my review in 2020 , 2021
then i want to tell u that iphone 11 is 4G phone
not 5G means not future proof for me ( if u r using for 3,4 year ) then Go for iphone 12 coz its 5g with amoled display with less edges compare to 11

Last but List
AMEZON sends me Genuine Iphone 11
sooo ignore NEGATIVE ⭐star review",4
2598,Don't buy don't buy,Don't buy don't buy don't buy don't buy don't buy.if your mobile demage or any issues they will not responsible to do anything.keep we are begging then to chase then till the time our return policy will be expired. Go to apple store if you need IPhone especially.my 50k gone now,1
2599,Nice product,"Pros :
Touch is really smooth
Battery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .
Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.
IOS14 update came within 2 days
Switching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.
Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.
Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.

Cons
Battery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .
Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.
Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.

Overall a nice product to buy.",3
2600,Just Fabulous... iPhone 11. Go for it without a second thought.,"100% genuine.
iPhone 11- White colour,128GB, 4GB Ram, Updated to iOS 14.

I ordered it about a week ago(17th Oct) and Amazon made sure that I get the choice of color and storage I ordered. Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.

I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.

Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.
Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.
Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.

Owning a iPhone is a dream for many. Thank you Amazon for making this dream happen.

My iPhone was sourced from Darshita Aashiyana Private limited.",5
2601,Worth to buy,"I got 128gb variant at 50,000/- discount price. It was a great deal for me.
But I had display issues with my product delivered from Amazon. Went to service centre, they are ready to give me a screen replacement .",3
2602,Waste of money,Very disappointed about this product.as they are earning amount fromtheir brand name same product service mot maintained.during two months of purchased my iphone 11 the lightning cable stopped working .i go through service centre but they didn’t help .everyone just making money .then what is the purpose for expense money in brand or reputed company even under 10 k android phones gives better service and product.waste of money.,1
2603,Heating issue solved for iPhone 11,"I was also facing the heating issue with iPhone 11, bought in recent sale. After updating to ios14 the device was getting hot a lot and with no heavy use also. For me it got solved by factory resetting the iPhone 11 from settings. It’s reset all data and setting option . Since then it’s working fine for me no more heating issue. For those who bought it new and having heating issue, please try this hope it will work.👍",5
2604,Nice,"I liked everything and more feedback come while using, but for now it’s excellent!!",5
2605,Amazing Phone,Apple products are usually very handy to use. This is awesome phone with very good touch in operation and good picture. Bit disappointed with battery backup as it gets exhausts by end of day with limited application running in background. Many new features like in built scanner and full page screen capture is very useful and easy to send and share. Very good Face ID detection.,4
2606,"iphone 11 ""Best Phone In The Price Range""","The Best Phone Available, Never Been Fan Of Android Phones. And Iphone 11 doesn't disappoint. Apart from not getting a power adapter and earphones in the box. Very Much satisfied with the product",4
2607,Next to perfect for a smartphone,"Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.

Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.

Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.

Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.

Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.

Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.

Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.

FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.

Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.

Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.",4
2608,Do not buy this phone,"I bought this phone in feb from Amazon, it worked good till Aug with no issues. After that randomly any app used to get uninstalled like whatsapp, insta, facebook. I called apple service centre multiple to get some help on this.but they could not help and finally i visited Apple service centre and they again formatted my phone and told me there was software issue and now this issue will not happen. Again after 5 days my apps got uninstalled. I regret buying this phone.",1
2609,Great upgrade from iphone 7,Amazing!!!!!,5
2610,It’s world bet phone iPhone go for it,I think because of last 10 years I used China phone bec of Ladakh problems I shift to iPhone am not the person to spend that much money for phone but I think iPhone 11 is great choice is best,4
2611,One hell of a phone!,"I switched from Android to iOS for the first time and it has been keeping me amazed! Smooth touch, responsive apps, excellent UI, mind blowing camera, I can now understand why iPhone users say something is different in it! Absolutely unbelievable experience! Cherry on top is security, use bank and payments app without any hassles! Loved it! Two drawbacks are 1) No headphone and charger (you have to shell more money 😭) 2) No fingerprint scanner and using faceid in COVID is a PIA.",5
2612,Class 💥,"Got this delivered today after 17 days only because it was out of stock during sale. But it's all worth the wait. No doubt iPhone is iphone.

Best Premium quality phone in this price range.
Got it at 46250₹ during GAF sale for the 64Gb variant.

This is my ever IOS experience and I know it'll take time to adjust with it. Everything seems paid in IOS but need to find a way 😅

You'll notice the LCD screen only when you're comparing it with another OLED phone otherwise it's display is Okay!!

The stereo speakers are fabulous, even the earpods sounds amazing.
I would also like to tell the people who kept saying they got fooled by Amazon, they didn't got Airpods as it was mentioned...my dear it was already mentioned Earpods and not Airpods, there's the difference between Ear and Air. Apple calls the normal Earphones as Earpods and the bluetooth one's are called Airpods.

Will update after a month of usage.",5
2613,More than a Delight in diwali,I am more than delighted .. apple has its own charm although I have used some apple devices like iPad and Mac this is my first iPhone and ya getting into the ecosystem I am surprised to know why apple turn up everyone’s head .. thank you apple to make our life a bit easier through technology although u take heavy bucks for everything.. 😂😂 but anyway this is a review and except from price everything is just more than a charm,4
2614,Amazing product,Camera quality and face recognition is amazing. First timers will have to spend time on setting up the phone as it is not as easy as android. The phone is not too big to hold nor too small. It’s just perfect and the performance is quite good since it has only been 1 day after I have bought it. Overall a very good product and I love it.,5
2615,Recent Purchase,"Battery life is as fine fine. Obviously the androids are far far better as per battery concerns. The feel, the resolutions are crystal clear. I wish there was a headphone jack but you get only AirPods connection.
Face ID recognition is very very quick.
Features are infinite.
It’s definitely nothing like other phones everything is different.
AND yes you have to buy a charger separately bit right i’am using my macbook charger 30Watt which i guess i need to change later as it may drain my battery life faster.",4
2616,Staying with iPhone forever,"Coming from iPhone se (2016), this one feels heavenly in terms of camera(nightmode and ultrawide feature being amazing) , display quality.
Performance of A13 bionic is good, though I never faced slowness in A9 chipset as well. The battery serves me for 1 whole day which is 3 times better than iphone SE.

I still find the 6.1” size little big for me, iphone 12 mini would have been perfect for my experience but didn’t want to spend 20k more for smaller form factor.

Hoping that iphone 11 would be my companion for more than 3 years as iPhone SE served me for 3 years.",5
2617,Received the device with certain defects,"It’s having potential defect with ringer. Phone isn’t ringing on incoming calls. Checked all settings, it’s a manufacturing defect or something done wrong at the seller’s end. Also, it had scratches on screen & back glass. Contacted Amazon, they refused to return/replace the device saying Apple products are taken care by Apple itself. We won’t do anything to help you.",1
2618,Great device but received reboxed iPhone,"soon after removing the film from screen I noticed a slight scratch on the screen. This should happen if the product is directly sold from the Apple store. I think it was returned or reboxed item. The film from screen wasn’t aligned properly and has bubbles with dust in it. I got so disappointed after seeing this.

Please don’t purchase from online if Apple Store is available in your city or purchase from Apple.com",5
2619,It's a genuine freaking iphone 11,"Best!!!ultimate value for money,got it for 60k😊,camera(specially night mode),display,sound everything is great.Battery life is good,but disappointed with inbox charger,had to buy a 12w charger separately.Overall best iphone you can have in a lesser price👍👍👍",5
2620,Awesome Deal,"This is my first iPhone, and I was Android user from more than 10 year, now I tried iPhone and feeling awesome

below are my finding.

1. Camera quality is awesome,
2. Screen size is awesome fit in palm
3. From Back side purple color is looks solid, along with apple logo.
4. Came along with charger and EarPods
5. Face detection is quite fast.
6. Don't have finger Print reader but i dont feel much presence as face detection is awesome and very fast.
7. Battery is quite good but charging is slow.
8. it comes with Volte so that is good where we have network issue in India.",5
2621,Highly Recommend,Thanks Amazon for providing genuine apple Iphone i had check it online apple authorised in apple online site it’s genuinely items warranty starts when i was active this mobile everything product is very nice and Red colour is Amazing and iam first time purchase online apple iphone Thanks again Amazon for this and i will trust you blindly in future any time.,5
2622,"Superb purchase, value for money","Initially i was afraid of ordering i phone online but somehow i ordered and then thanks to amazon for delivering me original product. Delivery was somewhat slow but i thnk it was due to COVID situation.
Overall good experience and very good product",4
2623,About my iPhone 11 comments,"Fingerprint, battery life & camera quality is awesome but apple given only 5gb space in iCloud that one is not enough in terms of iPhone.

Because my iPhone is full and not taking any backup automatically, So that one is more concern part for this any I phone.",5
2624,Complete Review,"(Writing this review after using one month)
1. Starting with built quality, I assure you will get the best premium feel.
2. Camera is just awesome,rare and front both.
3. If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.
4. The face id works butter smooth.
5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.
6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.
7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.
8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.
9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.
10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation",5
2625,Not up to Mark,"Product delivery was good.First I was worried to buy from amazon but I got a genuine product.Thanks Amazon.
About Phone:
1. Battery is good but slow charging
2. Camera is not as expected
3. Overall experience is average

Not value for money",4
2626,Overall good mobile,"Bought the iPhone few days. Actually after seeing the white colour I felt had to order different colour though, but it’s fine as long as ur using cover it doesn’t matter. Coming to looks it’s average as described earlier and battery back up is really good. Camera quality is just good no doubt in that. Very crisp, sharp and colours are defined well. Overs best iPhone for a medium budget in iPhones.",4
2627,Loved it,Simply super😍,4
2628,Worth Buying!,"I have used both Android and iOS devices in the past. In fact before purchasing iPhone 11 I had Samsung S10. Working as a Software Engineer I know how important the Data Security is and we all know when it comes to privacy, no brand can beat .

Pros:
1. Camera Performance is absolutely great! Check out some photos that I have clicked.
2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge.
3. With the power of Apple’s A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well.

Cons:
1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display.
2. Bezels are thick and looks old fashioned

Apart from these I don’t feel there are any concerns.",5
2629,An android user review!,"An android user review

It is more convenient than android and more simpler. At 1st 2 ,3 days u may face problems. But gradually u will adapt to it. It lacks many android features. But considering better camera,powefull processor, good battery life. This is a good smartphone. Morever its apple. It gives more security than android. Iam very much happy to have it",5
2630,Charger Replacement.,Hi. I have received my iphone 11 white 64 gb on 7th September 2020. The charger is not working properly. Its not charging my phone properly as its very slow. I want a new charger as soon as possible. I am using iphone since 2015 and this is not how a iphone charger charges the phone. I have used a different charger on my iPhone 11 and its charging properly. I request you to please send provide me a new charger.,4
2631,A great iPhone for the money,"Superb Performance

A13 Bionic is a 7nm-based processor that Apple claims delivers the fastest CPU and GPU performance in a smartphone. There is no denying that the iPhone 11 feels extremely fast and buttery smooth in pretty much everything from launching and running games to browsing social media apps.",5
2632,Iphone 11 great phone with good battery and performance,"First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.",5
2633,Best software experience after the pixels,"Am gonna divide into pros and cons
Pros:
Great camera
Excellent software experience
Stereo speaker have depth in audio
Smooth animations
Battery can last upto 1 day if you are a causal user
Lag free gaming
Ip 68

Cons
Display 😖 though you won't notice it but if you pixel peep you can certainly find difference.
No fingerprint sensor. I feel fingerprint authentication is more convenient than face scanner.
Huge notch feels outdated.
Charging takes one eternity XD.

Verdict
If you want a phone for long term usage then you can go for it but if your priority is better display and better charging speed better go with OnePlus or some other devices. Rest be assured 5g won't come soon in India. Still I think it's better than iPhone 12 considering price.",5
2634,Awwwesome device - iPhone 11 White 128 GB,"Phone design and build looks premium. Camera quality is excellent and night mode works really well. Battery life is awesome lasts for a day or little more than that on moderate usage.

Pros:
Battery life
Security - I moved from android so I can feel the difference
Face ID - works even on pitch dark environment
Best processor A13 Bionic
Best camera

Cons:
Display could be been Oled or amoled. It’s just Liquid Retina display

Other than that excellent device to use. Can feel the performance without any lags what so ever.",5
2635,Best ever phone,Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can’t be beaten by any other device. It’s really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also. I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.,5
2636,“Right amount of everything” - True beast,"After using it for around 10 months, now I’m giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don’t want to shift to an Android device. I don’t gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you’re addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it’s like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period.",5
2637,Checks to verify your iphone is new,"Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:

- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.
- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.

There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.

The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me.",5
2638,Awesome phone. No issues with the Seller too,"I was a bit skeptical to order or not reading some negative feedback in the reviews section. Thankfully, i did not face any issues with the seller or the product.my phone was well packed and sealed and delivered within the stipulated time. warranty too was one year after activation of the phone .

As for the phone, its just awesome, fast, great battery, great camera. If you are looking for an upgrade and want to purchase the iphone 11, go ahead.",5
2639,Great phone with a few hiccups.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros:
I’ve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.

Cons:
I didn’t believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it’s Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it’s a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It’ll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it’s extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I’m always wearing a mask and cannot face id.

Overall it’s a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.

EDIT: After 1 year of usage, this isn't a phone it's simply an inconvenience, and the worst RAM management ever, once your phone is full with media, it's close to impossible to transfer photos to a HD or a Laptop it keeps on giving errors, I'm trying for months, and so it's full, the apps continuously keep crashing and phone heats up a lot. I wish to use a huge hammer on it, and if that Steve Jobs wasn't dead already, I'd be after him to not kill but torture him the way he's doing me. DO NOT R.I.P. newb.",1
2640,Worst decision and life time lesson,"After switching to IOS from android, life became very hard to communicate and transactions became nightmare. Worst experience of limited and restrictful functionality of ios.
Planning to switch android again.",1
2641,Good Buy,"Im writing this review after 1 month 4 days of usage. Im using this typically as a proffessional one. Regarding the battery life iphone 11 is doing exceptionally good. Camera quality is awesome. The speed of the phone is also commendable. The only thing you make sure that u receive genuine product. After buying the item i was afraid seeing so many cclaims that amazon and flipkart selling cloned iphones so i had crosschecked my phone using seriel number, imei, etc. So guys you can surely go for this item in this price range.",5
2642,The battery back up and the camera clearity is amazing,"i like product in every way the camera , battery backup, user interface everything good the best my last use was iphone 7 after i switch to iphone 11 the both diffrent in every way by user interfrace everything was planning to go for 12 but i think 11 is also not bad option because there both fuction are pretty same like the product money well spend :)",5
2643,"It’s kind of 50-50 , Not good not Bad but above average","This is my first iPhone just moved android to iPhone. It’s totally different from android
Pro:
Camera is too good
Feature are very good for safety purpose.
Cons:
Phone charging is quite slow almost takes 2 hours to get 80% charge
Sometimes phone get freezes
If network is having one or two bar connectivity issue is there.
It will get heated for after continuous use of 3-4 hours.
Won’t give premium feel that quite disappointing",3

2645,"My old iPhone failed to pass the swimming test… So, I bought a new one.”",An iPhone is a perfect machine then one can have. Tho am writing the review with my android 😂🤣. On the positive side Iam very much satisfied with the product. I was lil concern with the packaging that I got cause it was not seemed good to me so I recored the delivery process in my phone to be sure. I unboxed the phone infront of the delivery guy.,5
2646,in Green colur its look more pretty....iphone 11🥰🤩👌,love iphone 11... and its green colur is unique👌🤩🥰,5
2647,Refurbished products are sold on amazon,Fake product on great Indian festival sale. Do not trust products as they are selling refurbished phones in sale. Apple care center denied for warranty stating that this is a refurbished IPhone which I buyed from Amazon. Worst experience ever.,1
2648,Fake accessories - Highly disappointed,My charger stopped working in 10 days. I think they are not selling authentic accessories. It's a lesson learned that never ever buy such gadgets from amazon. Buy your iphone only from apple store. Highly unsatisfied after paying heavily.,1
2649,"The end to your endless search for fully loaded, advanced and unbeatable phone now in the market!","Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!👍",5
2650,"Good phone, i hate ios",Good Phone.. buy android if u want better value 😁 Gave this to my sister who loves it. im still amazed how ios user can tolerate the User Interface and the file management!!,5

2652,You should read it.,"Every thing is excellent and do not afraid if it starts heating bcz it is normal for iphones or ipads bcz they transfer their heat to the surrounding via metal plate.

2656,Marvellous phone,"The iPhone 11 is one hell of a phone. Though 2 year old model but could easily take on today's flagship phones. Camera quality is awesome. Quality of sound in Apple music beyond imaginable. Battery life is better than most of the android phones.

In one word it's a WONDER",5
2657,Excellent Apple iPhone,"This iphone has a nice fairly large display, with great colour and contrast. The phone is sleek and has very good battery life. I charge it once in two days.

No 5g support,No finger print sensor, no fast charger,no case inside box, best new was e sim support we can use as secondary sim I.e dual sim support in others words if we say, battery life is ok, over all 4 out of 5. Best experience I would have given 5 out of 5, if it supports 5g.",4
2660,Phone heats up very much,"Phone heats up very much, waste to purchase such high cost item which heats up in less than 10 mins of usage.
I am not able to schedule a replacement for this through Amazon portal. It says 10 days replacement option. But does not accept replacement scheduling.",1
2661,Liked the phone but it has some issue with heating up on the back side..,I got this phone yesterday and started using the phone today since morning.. It has suddenly started heating up.

2662,Super Phone,Iphone 11.... ❤️ what else you want... Go for it superb Phone... no issues all fine... working GOOD,5
2663,No comparison with others,"Have been using it for past week. Switched from an Android device.
Got this in the Great Indian festival sale in October. It’s Camera is awesome. The battery life is amazing so far. Gives you approx 1.5 days battery backup with moderate usage. Haven’t tried gaming on this and might not do it! Not a fan of gaming. Wide variety of apps on the App Store!

The only ‘cons’ of this device/ all Apple devices would be limited free cloud storage/ backup, and the WhatsApp data not able to transfer from an Android to iOS. All the chats got deleted.

Also, You shouldn’t really be looking for a review about an iPhone. You’re considering it because you know it’s worth! :P",5
2664,Worth-It and Very much Genuine!,"Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).
Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*
Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.

Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.
However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).

Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!😊",4
2665,"Awesome camera, long lasting battery and neat performance","Awesome camera, long lasting battery and neat performance.. Display is good if you don't have anything to compare. Battery charging is very slow.
Removed a star just for the display and charging speed, everything else is awesome.",4
2666,I loved it,"This is my first iPhone so I am learning to use it.Being a tech savvy person, I liked the software, battery backup, touch very much. Earlier Iused google and Samsung phones, but iPhone is definitely superior. It is more secure than android ones and the settings in each app is highly customisable.
It is a nice purchase from Amazon.
Thank you Amazon for timely and safe delivery!",5
2667,Purchased it on discount and very satisfied with my busying decision,"Happy with my busying decision. No issues with performance at all. Good battery life along with very good camera.
There is not fingerprints reader that’s the downside .",5
2668,PEOPLE ARE LYING,"Why are people saying they sell fake products, I received the genuine product . The purple lilac colour I love it. But only thing I was upset is I ordered in 16 October and I got it on 28 October.the battery life is sooooooo good,I didn’t expected this from a 3000mah battery. And about the heating issue,yeah when I was setting up the phone it was heating up a bit and ... now after one day of use there is no problem, it does heats hip a bit when I play heave game like PUBG and mobile legends for hours. But there is no problem. And the camera quality, gorl please don’t talk to me,it’s sooo good,the night mode , man, look at the photos I clicked, I don’t even need to edit it.I LOVE THE IPHONE.",5
2669,Everything is just awsm. Go for it blindly.,"Battery - I was bit confused for battery backup. But i m happy, it last all day while using two sim together.
Camera - Camera is very very gud but not excellent. If u like natural details pics then its for u but if u like punchy colors and lots of make up then this is not for u. Personally i like it.
Performance- Just awsm, if u r android user and u r shifting to ios then u will never be regret. So smooth and secure.",4
2670,85/100,"I’ll be frank here.
If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.

If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.

The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.

Having said that, the phone is not bad.
It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.

Hope this helps.",4
2671,Superb purchase,Execllent pruduct. Be it camera or the battery life everything is superb. Earlier i was little worried that i should get this from apple store or amazon but bought online and i have got 100 percent genuine product. You can find many reviews saying that amazon delievers clone mobile please do not judge based on those reviews people just put fake reviews to get componsations and when they do not get anything for free they do such cheap stuff. Only regreat is i should have wait for more 10 days because i got this for 60000 and in diwali sale it was onlyfor 48000 so this is the only thing otherwise this apple product is excellent.,5
2672,Worth Buying 😊,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Clicked some pictures and recorded a wide angle video (may not be good as amazon compressed it here), but nothing can beat iPhone camera.
Bought 2 iPhone11 during this festival sale. Amazing price and what can i say about phone, its the best out here.
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ For everything, prices, delivery time (1 day delivery), packaging.",5
2673,Genuine product and a good deal by amazon,"I purchased iPhone 11 with wireless AirPod 2nd generation... i got both of this in 59k. Below i have listed pros n cons
Pros: Both iphone and Airpods are genuine. To get confirmation install apple support app and get connect with apple. Have a call and check everything
Cons
1. Packaging is pathetic, i cant believe that a giant organisation like amazon can sends a valuable product just in a simple plastic bag without taking any precautions. This is very serious matters, amazon shouldn’t repeat this.",4
2674,A perfect package,"Being my very first iOS device after using android for a decade I would say that Its a really nice device with amazing features and a top notch camera.
The A13 Bionic chip takes care of all the multitasking and heavy apps like cakewalk. Battery life is unexpectedly good as compared to the previous models. Overall its a good device to go for in this price range.",5
2675,Scintillating festive deal in AGIF Sale,"Just amazed buy the great Indian festival sale, got benefited by the offer, I waited for 24 hrs others I would have got 1k advantage. The black version of it feels premium, camera, battery and display are optimised in the updated version of iOS 14. Yet to explore more of its claims. Just loved it, Amazon is systematic in delivery design layout. It's camera performance just adds icing to the memories you want to capture.",5
2676,Killer deal at Rs 46999,"i got this phone for rs 46999. Was about to purchase android at this price, but when i saw apple days and checked offer, i just took it.

excellent phone and camera.",5
2677,Great phone & Timely Delivery,"Another great product from Apple. Took a long time for me to decide on the colour and the model but finally decided to go for 64GB in black colour.
The face recognition works well even in darkness without issue. Being an average user, I am able to get the battery for the 2nd day after full charging. Both the front and rear cameras are superb and professional to use with extensive features. Lot of intelligent features were considered in the IOS 14.2 and it all works fine in this model. The spatial audio produces clear sound with Dolby Atmos. The power charger and wired earphones were no more provided by Apple in the package and they encourage to reuse existing ones from old iPhones. Got the phone delivered by Amazon on same day in a good condition. Overall this is a great phone and one can go for it confidently and buy from Amazon.",5
2678,Great phone with super camera and ios experience.,"Switched from Android one plus to ios with iphone 11. With 1 week of use it meets and sometimes exceeds the expectations in terms of user experience. Camera is great , ios14.1 is cool , battery is decent but early to say. Hopefully would stick to it for considerable amount of time.",5
2679,Security,Amazing delivery by amazon i never thought that this much of security . Firstly i was little bit of nervous after seeing some reviews that this seller is not good so i was quit nervous bcoz 50k is huge money but after seeing the security and seeing the product i was very happy and i was using this phone since 2mnths i haven't seen any issues,5
2680,Hyped mobile and don’t waste money for a apple logo,"Not so good it’s a hype about iPhone nothing is great about it,my realms 3 pro is equally good with new features and good camera",1
2681,Best,"Got this at Great Indian Festival, top class phone with ios14 update already, great camera, performance lag free , battery life way good than even android phones with 5000mah batteries .",5
2682,Pleasant Experience coming from Android,"Been using the 11 for a Month now. Love the phone so for except for the display. And few hiccups in software being coming from Android.

It’s good deal for me to get 128GB for 53k.",4
2683,APPARIO sells me a defective iPhone 11,"Same issue as a lot of others my phone switched off on its own and now unabke to force start or switch on. Amazon as usual said we will Refund not replace, Appario it seems is always the one swlling auch defectove peices the whole day i waste running around to get it to start work . Lost my data with no backup, sad to know such pathetic state of these damn expensive phones.",1
2684,Excellent 😍,"Phone is just Awesome go for it ...I am writing review after 1month of usage,no issues as of now, no heating problem .as I have seen many negative reviews in amazon but I didn’t notice any serious problem.camera is excellent and it has a decent battery life.it’s the best iPhone considering features and budget point of view..",5
2685,Great.Value for money.,"The delivery was fast it reached in 1 day. The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12’s)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn’t need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.",5
2686,The Perfect Power Package !,"I brought this phone for 58k on prime day sale using my HDFC card .

+ve : best camera , sufficient battery , smooth , A13 bionic chip , display ( doesnt feel like 720p display ) , speaker .! , colour , features

-ve : no fast charger provided in the box , no telephoto lens at this cost , android users find it difficult initially .

Overall , this is a perfect Iphone , and thanks amazon for fast delivery ..",5
2687,Average look and few disappointments,Button placements were wrong and best place for power button is top (like previous versions) only. Now they kept like Android phones and whenever I want to increase volumes it takes screen shot. The phone also looks average and most of the time I mistook my wife android phone as my phone. Not very happy with iPhone11,4
2688,BEST PHONE BETTER THEN iphn 12,"very premium colour (white)
i got this in 46800 in sale which is better then iphone 12
picture in picture feature not working it need updates
overall phone is awesome",4

2690,iPhone 11 is Class,My God... This phone is class. Battery life 🤟🏻 Performance 🤟🏻 Face reader 🤘🏻,5
2691,Totally from apple not fake at all,"This product is really good and NOT at all fake, I bought this a few months ago and its working perfectly with no harm at all. The only thing I did find a problem in was updating the iOS but I don't think it has anything to do with the product! Overall a very good find and for this price its a steel!!!! I would definitely recommend!",5
2692,High price,"Its a good phone let me give you the pros and cons

*CONS-
1. Price is to high
2. They don't include a charger😠52k for phone 2k for charger
3. Not even air pods like before
4. I phone 6s gave everything but this 😠

Pros-
1. Feels so fast
2. Best upgrade from 6s
3. 4 gigs of ram is enough
4. Best camera upgrade from 6s
5. Most powerful I phone☺️👍👍

Its good if your coming from previous i phone",4
2693,Bad deal,"This is not a good deal,because when I ordered iphone 11 it showed that it had a charger and headphone ,today I got the product without charger and headphone ,it looks like cheating",1
2694,Awesome product in base model,"I am using the I phone 6s for the last 5 years. But this 11 is awesome for its clarity, very sensitive touch screen, sound system and photography. Size is more or less same as 6s.",5
2695,iPhone 11,Everything is same as iPhone xr one camera is extra that is change everything.I dipped my phone in aquarium(water resistant IP68) phone is working perfectly.i am so excited in phone performance.i never used this type of phone.,5
2696,One of the best SmartPhone buy in 2020,"They say 'the Worlds best phone' don’t need any reviews. But still, I would like to share my experiences..
I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,
It was delivered on time.
There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, in-fact, I am happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.
I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.
This phone is super smooth, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.
Camera is another best thing of iphone 11.
Talking about the design and build quality, it is great. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.
Apple have improved the sound & audio quality as-well. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.
Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer. Highly recommended!",5
2697,Important tacts to avoid frauds and small review on the product,"At first I was very afraid of ordering an Iphone from Amazon as many have very bad reviews like “given used phone”,”defective item”,etc. Still took thr risk to order it from this seller. FORTUNATELY I WAS LUCKY TO GET A GOOD PIECE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.An important note which i always follow is that whenever u get a package from amazon delivery boy -DO CHECK AND OPEN IT INFRONT OF HIM”many a times i have seen tweets that even u have the video of unpackaging they refused to take the order if some things are not right.
Now regarding my views on Iphone 11 in a single word -“AWESOME”....Liked the elegant design and top notch features .",5
2698,Still not clear about buying iphone 11,"Overall a good package some improvements on xr
Don’t buy 64 gb as apps size is more in iphone so not enough in my view rest ur wish
Impressive camera
Avg battery
Smooth experience
Avg speakers
Good display
Powerful processor
Cool customisation and features
And lot more still finding
If u hav budget then go for it or u can wait if u want new model and hav no issue with money or can go for 12
If u r bored with android then try this
Want to try apple then go for it its great really
Review may varies from person to person…",4
2699,Average mobile!,"Good when comes to camera and ios experience, but when comes to video clarity on YouTube, it is pathetic..even a 15k worth mobile will give a better experience...",4
2700,"Disappointed with speaker, it stopped working","I am writing this review after using it for a month.
Performance is excellent and the camera too.
Little disappointed with slow charging as it comes only with 5 wt adapter

But now i am facing bottom speaker problem and its a very big problem for me as it stopped working and at this price point this should not have happened as from my point of view.",2
2701,Amazon Vendor supplied defective product-,"You Have supplied defective product and now as per your policy there is no replacement, Now I need to talk to Apple customer care why ? if i used the phone for some time than it get faulty than i understand ,

Very bad experience and last 24 hr trying to reach customer care but not able to get the any agent on call.. kindly replace this item immediately to further escalation...",1
2702,Does not seem to have simple yet useful things...,"Have been a Sony fan for more than a decade. Since Sony does not sell its phones in India, had to pick this one. This phone lacks the notification LED on the front. You need to turn the phone on to look for anything you have missed when you were away from the phone. No fingerprint sensor. No smart dial or i am yet to explore the option. The earpods which came with the phone is all plastic and not useful for long hours of music. May be they are made that way.",3
2703,Very expensive but good is when they bring more exclusiveness,"Everyone talks about the good points like camera, battery or looks. I would focus to the bad points I found. It depends on the buyer who will refer what before investing.
1. This phone has no fingerprint scanner.
2. The camera app must have some exclusive features.
3. The phone migration feature was troublesome for me.",4
2704,4 stars,Bought it for my husband. All’s good except signal reception. I don’t face any problem with my iPhone 12 but my husband faces those issues in iPhone 11. He wasn’t having any signal troubles while using his previous phone which was Android.,4
2705,Superb Phone and delivered on time,"Writing this review after one week’s usage - iPhone 11 (White) - 128gb

1. What the most I liked about in this iPhone 11 is the Battery life: Battery lasts for 2- two and half days after its fully charged, even if you are using hotspot, wifi, bluetooth, listening music, battery was still 28% and still running smoothly. Which is far more better than Android Phones.

2. Prefer buying back cover that covers your camera as well, to avoid scratches in it in future.",5
2706,Value For Money,"First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you’ll face no problem there.

Screen response time is very accurate there’s no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you’re not getting a charger from now it’s not bad.

When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can’t enjoy it in 720p screen but it’s there.

So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it’s around 55k so definitely if you’re going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.",5
2707,Nice product,Really a wonderful product from apple. I'm a new user for apple product and this is my 2nd product after 8 years and price also I got 68600rs after using HDFC credit card. Initially I was afraid to buy from this seller after read some comment's from the site later I think to cancel too but now I'm holding a good product and I'm finally happy with the product,5
2708,Amazing phone.,"I loved this iphone. I was so confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative comments regarding heating issue, dont buy from so and so manufacturer and i took a chance. Well I made the right choice. I have been using it for 2 months and never experienced any kind of heating issue even after continuosly using them. To the ones who are gonna buy them, jusst dont hesitate, JUST BUY. ITS AMAZING.",5
2709,No doubts if upgrading from an iPhone 6/6s/7/8 or earlier,"Upgraded from iPhone 6s 32 GB. Great Cameras (Wide, Ultrawide, and portrait modes). Exceptional battery life (Works up to 7 to 8 hours on iOS 14). Seamless experience. The phone is slightly heavier compared to the 6s. A faster chip (A13 Bionic). Face ID is great. WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great. This phone is highly recommended instead of the 12, due to the battery size (iPhone 11 has 3110 mAh, iPhone 12 only has only 2815 mAh).",5
2710,Simply Awesome,"A great phone, pretty slick even at the end of 2020.
Yes, no 1080p resolution, no OLED panel, but its still a pretty good package, not to mention smooth iOS experience",5
2711,iPhone is iphone,iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos,5
2712,It's Good?,"I don't think there should be a review because people who want to buy this phone must have gone through all the bits of its features. Just one thing, that is my opinion, for a price of 50k, Apple could have given an OLED display instead of an LCD.",5
2713,Made in India,Product was delivered in just 1 day😍 and received which was made in India 🇮🇳 awesome phone💯,5
2714,"Fast, Literally. Outstanding Camera!","An amazing Phone. I switched from Android to iOS and it’s too good. This device is really fast with the A13 Bionic chip. The camera and the different modes as well as the Portrait feature is just outstanding. Don’t go for 12 if you are greeting 11 at such a great price. I got it at 44.9k which included and exchange of an older phone plus discounts on cc and Amazon cash back. Overall, the best phone in this range.",5
2715,Fantastic IPhone,"Great phone from Apple. As usual premium feel. Performance is great. Face unlock, battery life, camera quality is superb. Amazon delivery is great",5
2716,Great!!,"I loved it.Firstly I was bit scared of buying a phone from amazon because firstly there were some negative reviews and ofcourse cost of phone is not less.I was thinking to buy from croma or from a store but because of such a great offer ,I decided to buy and when I received the product it was awesome.",5
2717,iPhone 11,"Excellent product by Apple once again.

Camera quality is fantastic and low-light pictures are brilliant.
Battery Life is decent and last for full one day (as per usage).
Face ID is really fast (can be annoying outside since you are wearing a mask these days)
Screen is rich in color and vides and photos looks amazing.

Overall an excellent device.",5
2718,Iphone 11-Masterpiece,"Though the reviews were bad of seller.. was little bit afraid..

But recieved a brand new iphone 11 at 46750₹.

The color is so fresh,calm and composed.
Looks very affluent onc u hold it in ur hand.

Camera quality is just fab.

If you hav good budget

As there were battery issues with iPhone 6s but there are none with this one, absolutely great battery life. Also, the camera quality is way too enhanced... it’s damn awesome ! Plus, not to forget about the face unlock that precisely detects your face even when there’s less light. Talking about delivery and packaging, I received the package in proper conditions from amazon & there were no damages on the outside or inside of the package i.e. I received my phone as expected ! Absolutely happpyyy with this purchase, Thanks Amazon.",5
2724,Not the best,It has some heating issues and the wide angle lens is quiet grainy in-terms of picture quality.,1
2725,Worth the Money you pay,I had been using android for more than 7 year so thought of changing the phone so bought iPhone 11 Green it been a month now it super smooth and battery is very good last a day or more depends on a user. Only drawback is cant back up whatsapp from android 🙃 so people who are thinking to buy just go for it with hesitation. And the delivery was super fast got my phone delivered within 14hrs,5

This I phone 11...he given me display spot in it....picture attacted plz see.....but he take. The replace and money transfer to me....my 4 days are visited...becz of the...,1
2727,Awesome battery life poor charging speed,Battery is plus and minus both at the same time that’s why 4 star. I charge it on Friday night that lasts up to Sunday night. One major drawback is poor charging time. I normally plug charger once 6% battery is left to avoid charging discharging cycle of battery. The supplied 1amp charger takes 2.5 hours to reach 100%.,4
2728,Awesome product,"Don’t hesitate to buy it, I got a good deal of 48k. Feeling lucky... just go for it... thanks to Amazon for giving 2 days delivery.

Initially I was worried by reading the reviews on apple products by amazon but I can say I am 100% satisfied and will buy my second apple product from Amazon only.",5

2731,Most awaited ❣❤,"So I love it , colour is also awesome. And face recognition is too good, battery is good if will compare it from previous apple phone, but it take much time to charged up the phone.
So you can go for it.",4

About the phone no defect no scratches the phone was brand new as expected it was worth buying with the offer price . Loving and adoring it the fc id works perfectly the battery life according to my usage is good and camera is too good.,5
2733,Excellent flagship iPhone at this price!!,"One of the best iPhone at this price.
No problem. No heating or bezel issue for a Norma user.
Display is very fine and crisp. Not like normal lcd screen. Far more greater quality then other phones which show more resolution in numbers.
Sound quality is great.
And Apple customer care assistance is what makes them unique.",5
2734,First time in apple series I had Worst experience,"Really got upset by purchasing I Phone 11, speaker is not working from day one. I requested to replace the set, but no response, battery backup also not coming for half day. Pls help me out.",1
2735,Very happy,"Apple has its own quality,but Amazon fulfilled our (middle class)dreams ....thank you Amazon @greatindianfestival...”amazon, har pal khusiyon ki”😊",5
2736,The Best Value IPhone from APPLE!!!!!,It’s a value added phone for the money. If you are someone is gonna buy an iPhone for the first time. You can surely go for iPhone 11. It has the same camera (except for the telephoto lens) of the pro models. The iOS optimization would give you good battery life. Apple also promises updates for the next 5 years. I have been using this phone for 1 year now and the performance is exactly the same like how I bought the first day. Everything is so amazing about this phone that you won’t have to spend money to buy the pro models. Surely go for the iPhone 11 you won’t regret it.,5
2737,My first I phone,"As everyone says iphone never hang, thats true! After using iphone i think you will not use android. Iphone 11 battery also good. It give me 2 days backup. Only disappointment that phone doesnt come with charger and you need to spent more 2k",5
2738,"Apple is good, mine one isn’t. Defective from the very 1st day",Very bad experience as a first time apple user. never expected from amazon being one of the most active customer. Delivered a defective phone. Very disappointing.,1
2739,Waste,Some times songs are automatically playing in phone idk what happened in phone i am unable to stop songs on that time after shutdown only the songs are stop that is the big problem and some times whatsapp also run slow,1
2740,Worst to worst experience.,Don’t buy iphone from amazon. iphone11 to be precise. If some issues come up they will go in “pluaisble deniability” mode.,1
2741,The Best budget iPhone,Around 50K it’s the best phone if you are interested in iOS. Display is not as great as other iPhones but neither bad. Only thing I criticise is audio quality is not that great despite having dual stereo speakers. It’s not that punchy and get fuzzy at high volume. Battery backup is good to last entire day. You cant feel on paper until you start experiencing that everything is just amazing.,5
2742,Amazing!,"Good battery life (extreme usage will t take you through a 12 hours easily), however with the 5w inbox charger it takes about 3 to 3.5 hours to full charge. No fingerprint reader but extremely quick face ID. Good camera - the apple trademark. Moving from android is slightly tiresome if the move to iOS app isn’t working but contacts and other details can be pulled from google emails/drives.",5
2743,iPhone worst experience,"I used the phone for one n half month suddenly today it got hanged n after few minutes later it was showing complete black screen
I asked apple but they said need to go to store as device is dead during Covid -19 and they can't detect the reason.
When I asked Amazon they asked to contact dealer.. it's going round n round in a loop
No one here trying to help",1
2744,Not worth,Iphone 11 at thisnpruce when android is available at 40k.other than brand image nothing great.battery is so poor and takes time to charge when android phone gets charged in 15 mins.Apple will soon realise.They hvnt worked on these,3
2745,"📱As always good, better, best 👍","📱 are best always, its expensive but total worth it once you use , camera, speed, screen, and many more just like human applications which gives you amazing experience in daily use... special phone speakers 🔊 are terrific, 😃👍...",5
2746,Best in market!,"I received the phone on 23rd October and I’m loving every bit of it. No overheating issues as mentioned in so many reviews. When it’s comes to battery, it’s amazing compared to Samsung.",5
2747,Go for it without any Hesitation if ur budget is ok,"Rare camera - oswm pictures , ultra wide is fantastic ,
Night mode - I am fan of Night mode
Selfi camera is good

Battery life - 7-8 hours screen on time (social media , you tube , video playback
Face unlock - too fast
Screen - lcd screen is ok not like amoloid , touch is ok , brightness good
To fast processors
Normal charging time 3 hours
Looks -great
If ur budget is ok then go with ios
I bought 128gb at 52k",5
2748,iPhone 11 iOS 14 upgrade and bionic ship 13 awesome,This is true experience of iPhone. I’m an android user first time changed to IOS. It’s really awesome compared to android. IOS very smooth & very easy to use. iPhone 11 camera 12mp has equal to one plus 64mp quad camera. Battery life is great iPhone has great battery life. Dolby sound experience is really superb. One main advantage of iPhone is no heating issue like android devices. Very smooth display. Comfortable to handle in one hand. iOS 14 upgrade is feel great experience. I suggest to iPhone to sale in India with same cost selling in other countries. Surely no one can replace you in market.,5
2749,Apple is apple,"Over all good phone, i can play pubg for 3 and a half hour with low setting with full charged to 10 %• Camera is good, but charger is very slow, its take more than 3 hour to full chareged from 0 to 100 %.",3

2751,Awesome Camera & Improved Siri...Just enjoy,"Awesome Camera & Improved Siri...Just enjoy
Did not like charger provided with the product too less powerful to charge battery.. very slow charging capacity, however mobile last long once fully charged...sufficient for mobile extensive users except gamer.",5
2752,Disaaponited with amazon service,"Product is good and original but i'm very much dissapointed with amazon service.
Earlier it was clearly mentioned that if i made payment throgh HDFC credit card i get 1750 rs instant discount 1250 rs cashback with in 3 days of shipment and till date i didn't get any cashback. I have also called 3-4 times to amazon customer care and now they are saying this offer is not applicable in i phone.
Very dissapointed 👎",5
2753,Amazinggggggg.....❤️❤️❤️,When i was ordering this phone on amazon...i was a bit scared to order after i saw many bad reviews about getting a wrong delivery...some got dummy phone...some said that used phone was sent to them.....but when I got this phone ....it was the right product and....with no faults in delivery....delivery was done very safely....and securely......thank you Amazon....keep doing good things...,5
2754,"Don’t think twice, buy it",Thankful that I got a brand new phone that wasn’t defective. I have heard stories and read reviews of people getting fake phones or defective phones etc. so far so good. This appario seller is a bit shady according to the negative reviews but take your chance,5
2755,Perfect to perfection,"Great product (which was indeed expected) as Apple always delivers the best.
Switched from iPhone 6 and this has been the perfect switch.. Great battery life with such faster face recognition. And you won’t find a better camera in the market than this (specially the night mode)

But thanks to Amazon for delivering the product without any issues. I’m saying this because I ordered the phone at 10pm and it was delivered the next day at 9:30am which was completely unexpected in these lockdown days.",5
2756,Awesome phone,Apple products are always the best. No complaints at all. Awesome responsiveness. Just the right amount of everything. Face Id works seamlessly. Just glace at your phone and it unlocks. Screen clarity is awesome. Your eyes won’t strain like other phones.,5
2757,A steal deal,"Purchased this during amazon great Indian festival sale, costed me around 45500
I was little sceptical about smartphone online but amazon is trustworthy so i placed my order.
It was a steal deal for me!
Loved it! It was delivered in 2 days",5
2758,iPhone 11,"One of the best iPhones. It has all the good features in a decent price. The good thing about Apple is that it gives you the same performance in iphone11 as the flagship iphone11 pro/promax. It just cuts down on certain features like display or an additional camera.

Overall a good phone and a good experience till date.",5
2759,Nothing a title,"Mobile is super
But I will book on date 06/08/2020
I will Received mobile 19/08/2020

2760,Feel Cheated By Amazon,"Learned a lesson today; don’t buy any high value items from Amazon. Product was defective on arrival, Amazon refused to replace it and asked me to take it up with Apple",1
2761,Love for iphone,I had to wait a longer time to get it but it was worth the wait this is my second iphone and as always i m in love with it,5
2762,Complete star piece🌟,"Its been a month i am using this phone i.e the iphone 11 which i ordered from amazon and got the delivery by 14th of july. Since then, i have never faced any issue regarding this piece. Except the charger issue it must have been a rapid charger instead of this 5 watt charger its still ok it takes 4-5 hours to charge completely.",5
2763,Amazing Service!,Its obvious how amazing this product is otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this review. I would like to shed some light on how amazing Amazon is. I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!,4
2764,"Good mobile for the current price of Rs 59,900 in Amazon.","Battery life is quite good in the new iPhone 11. For my daily use the battery lasts for more than 36 hr.
Could get a discount of Rs 6,400 for exchanging my iPhone 6s Plus.
Face ID recognition works very well.
There is no fingerprint scanner.
Yet to study the camera quality.",5
2765,Replace the iPhone as screen screen display not responding in only 5months old iPhone,"This is my first iPhone, my experience is not good as there is so much screen problem like the display not responding while talking on phone or doing something on phone.
My request is to get it replace my handset as apple is also claiming to get it replace until the phone manufactured till May 2020, but my case is border line my phone manufacturing date is between 1st to 7th June 2020, would like to inform the distributor to put these cases to apple and get it replace as soon as possible as I’ve spent alot on this purchase.",2
2766,Brand worth it,"After 2 day of use i found worth it
Camera quality is very good before buying I’m bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven’t played game coz not a fan of games and all.

That is,it stop working after 2 weeks.I don’t know the problem behind it.It suddenly stops working and so i have to buy another charger again.Without that the phone is awesome.Good system,good camera as expected from apple.Overall good phone and i recommend to people who are huge fan of apple brand.",5
2772,Super awesome!!!!,"The wait for google pixel combined with the amazing discount at amazon made me a proud owner of this baby! Have been a long term user of MacBook hence already a fan of Apple!!!
Was a bit sceptical considering some of the reviews, however so far having a great experience",4

2780,Its an iPhone- Its definitely awesome!,"A great product that I got. Value for money. Got it in the offer period and its been 3 months I am using it. Too good. Probably these days 64GB is not enough and one should opt for 128GB. But the product that I have got, its great! Performance wise, Camera and picture quality, processor, overall a great one.",5
2781,IPHONE 11 128GB (WHITE),"Phone is awesome.
Has a very powerful full CPU.
Display just simply rocks.
Always apple had an battery issue.
Pubg works damn smooth.
Camera rocks.
Sound quality is not that good.
Size is just 6.1.
Quite handy.
Is costly than compared to other mobile brands where in this price range they can give u the better one.",4
2782,The Premium iPhone,"My second iPhone. Got at a decent price. This is literally a premium product.
Pros: Best front camera.
6.1”Liquid retina display.
A13 bionic chip.
Cons: picture quality drops while using wide angle camera.
glass back has high chance for breakage if dropped
PS: Don’t go for this product by attraction! can get any iphone at budget level for daily normal usage unless you are rich! best for productivity and high performance viz. Video editing, High end Games etc.",5
2783,Compelling ultra-wide camera New Night mode is excellent Long battery life Superfast A13 B,"This is one of the simplest reviews I’ve ever had to write: the iPhone 11 is the phone most people who are upgrading to a new iPhone this year should get. It’s an excellent phone, with one of the best cameras I’ve ever seen on a smartphone and terrific battery life. Apple’s also dropped the price by 50 bucks, Delivery speed of Delhivery courier is awesome",5
2784,Orginal product sealed,Phone is premium feels good in hand sound quality is good camera are okay you can record 4 k price is high go for one plus 8 t I use one plus 7t and there is a a little difference between both iphone 11 and OnePlus 7t 258 gb where as my iphone is 128 gb price difference 13 thousand,5

1. Fingerprint reader not available
2. Battery Just ok
3. Camera Quality Good but Not the Best
Very disappointing with weight, this iPhone is too heavy.",3
2788,Brilliant Phone.,"The phone is great. Seamless performance, amazing camera and good battery life considering that this is an iphone. The display is great even though it being a 720p lcd display it looks better than most oled displays. The only con is that the colour black is not exactly black its a weird shade of grey I’d recommend purchasing any other colour other than “BLACK”. Last but not the least Amazon was just brilliant at delivering the product, got the phone on the same day.",5
2789,Upgraded from IPhone 6 to IPhone 11,"Extremely happy with IPhone 11. Bought it at 50,000 during Amazon Sale. Battery and Camera are far better than the earlier model. It is a blind buy.",5
2790,Amazing,"I had iPhone 7 and now shifted to iPhone 11. I love the camera, battery life and simply everything... it looks cool... everything is working fine haven’t registered for esim though... Amazing according to me not sure about android users but iPhone users will find it amazing.... still this pack has the normal charger but apple has released new one with type c... only drawback I found",4
2791,iphone11- A power packed premium smartphone!!,The iPhone 11 is all round premium smartphone for millenials. The photos are good in low light conditions. Well the little 5 watt charger takes long time to charge the battery. I would suggest you to go with the 12 watt USB adapter sold seperately.,5
2792,Iphone 11 128gb Black beast,"Got a July 2020 make, assembled in China, 128gb black variant with accessories and phone box including outer seal intact. Overall happy with the purchase. I am giving a 4 star because of the packaging. The box piece was delivered within a loose amazon packet which could easily damage the product while in transit. Appario should really put an eye on shipping and handling as we are paying a fair amount for the phone.
Other than that everything looks good.",4
2793,Switching from Android to iOS,"This is my first iOS device and being used to Oneplus devices expectations were pretty high with iPhone. iPhone literally has surpassed all my expectations and proven to be the best decision I’ve made. The battery life, camera quality, simplicity of UI and everything else is worth experiencing. I got this phone of 128 gb during sale and paid 52,999 on no cost emi for 6 months.
The price on Amazon was 6k less than the market price and the delivery was fast and phone was handled in right way.",5
2794,Battery backup,"Being a middle class family I bought iPhone 11 with facing a lot of problems, waiting for almost 2 years by doing part time jobs But definitely it’s worth of money , camera is damn sooo good and performance is really really smooth and it’s battery performance is quite good ..Literally I don’t have words to explain how beautiful it looks and for its performance , it’s just perfect it’s worth of money , THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON FOR AMAZING SALE AND GIVING ME OPPURTUNITY TO BUY MY DREAM IPHONE IN SUCH A HUGE DISCOUNT .",5
2795,Shes Worth it!! 😂,"I don't know why they mentioned a Fingerprint reader when the device clearly doesn't have one.
Battery life and camera.. Guys its an IPhone.. N they are pretty Daymm impressive!
Only wish they added a charger with that..
Overall got what we paid for..",5
2796,Scratches on glass,"Like the build quality of phone, camera and battery life and of course the OS.
But what I can observe in last 15 days of use, the screen with lots of scratches. Didn’t expect this from Apple and the cost of phone. Apple mention it’s a strong glass but It can get easily scratched. Guys buy best quality screen protector with this phone.",4
2797,Premium yet retains the value,"Bought the green iPhone 11 for 50 in Oct 20 for 50k. Had missed the sale as did not find a 64 gb version in green colour then. The phone has lived to its expectation so far. Buttery smooth OS, excellent camera and most iOS apps have that sense of stability and reliability in them. Assurance to privacy has been another reason for switching over to iPhone.
Face ID does give trouble once in a while and does not unlock the phone.
Strongly recommend upper mid tier phone.",5
2798,Gud,I think no need to mention in brief 😂😂😂 as it's a iphone but battery backup is very gud I get whole day I use for call social media n playing games n camera quality as usual osm but struggles in low light a bit n face unlock in oms in any condition overall osm .,5
2799,"Improve battery life ,no matter how much good phone it is, to use it we need battery","Idk what this fringerprint reader is but
my phone touch is not so accurate,

Camera is preety good it would be better if ultera wide had low fstop

Battery sucks, using camera consumes too battery
it's been 4 month using it and Battery life is already in 97%",3
2800,System lag,"There is some lag in the processing speed, the phone got hang sometime also, there is a software update require may be because of that or something I don’t know,, but overall experience with my first iPhone is good

But still system lag sometime",5
2801,Best iPhone at this price,The best thing I like about it is it’s camera and performance.Privacy is no doubt the best.But it’s battery capacity is a bit low and it got discharged in 6 hours only if used continuously.The smartphone also has a heating issue.Otherwise This iPhone 11 is a beast.I got it for 55k only so I will say that in this price the smartphone is best.If you are looking for a better premium smartphone then don’t think just go for it.The delivery was also very fast. I got it within 4 days.,5
2802,iPhone 11 black patch?,Got new phone today and noticed a black patch 8n the initial setup screen.it can be due to the wallpaper in the background....Awaiting apple support. And I noticed some else posted the same in the review. So is it a real issue or is this how it will appear?,3
2803,Superb No Once Replace the iPhone,"Again after android usage I am back to iPhone
Earlier I was using iPhone 4, 5 and 6 Series for a change I was using android. Now I am back to iPhone (Specially iOS) due to the Performance.

2804,Didn't get the payback amount yet,"What about 5% money back offer...I've made payment by icici credit card Nd I'm a prime member too. However I haven't received the amount yet.
Kindly acknowledge",2
2805,Only 5G is missing.,"I bought this for my wife. Easy to use. Best camera. Best smartphone for videography.
FaceTime is the best feature to go for. Call quality and video are crisp and clear.
Battery life is good but it’s too thick to handle.
Only thing I miss in this phone is 5G feature.
However it’s not yet available in India but a device has to be future proof.",5
2806,My first iPhone,"This is my first iPhone and felt the difference between android and iOS. Really good, no hang and battery is better. Overall good. Got a chance to click some best pics.",5
2807,Best,East or west Iphone is the best.I was scared beacuse of the negative reviews (appario) but i was wrong i got original product and I verified though apple website.,5

its a froud they r sending defective products and re packed phones",1
2809,Amazon is fake and good at delivering fake products,"I have got a defective peace and when I call customer care they are all making fun with our emotions. Never buy anything from Amazon. Amazon is fake and they are not genuine. They will simply loot your money, sitback and watch the show.",1
2810,Iphone 11 is still a great buy in 2020!,Bought this for sister in Great Indian Festival offer at 49K. Its a great deal as iphone 11 is quite a power packed device even compared to iphone 12. Bionic 13 chip is fast for day long uses. Display is fantastic and camera is quite useful. This pro grade product is definitely going to last for next five years.,4
2811,Best phone in the market!,"I’m absolutely in love with this phone, this is my first ever iPhone and everything about it is amazing, the battery lasts me all day even with heavy usage. The camera quality is superb!
If it fits in your budget and then go for it without even a second thought! Loveeee it ❤️",5
2812,Perfect Camera,It is my 2nd IPhone after iPhone 7.The best thing that I have liked is the camera.Battery life is not that much great .Face recognition is super fast.Overall it’s a must buy iPhone if you want to upgrade from any IPhone predecessor.Apple could have given a better FHD display.,5

2815,Not satisfied at all,Receive the product. As mentioned in the product details there should be a Ear Pod with Phone. But no Ear Pods are there in the box. This is absolutely a fraud!! I need the PODs. A normal IPhone head phones are there in the box.,2
2816,4.5 outta 5,"Absolutely wonderful. Works like butter, has been a user of mid range android from beginning so wanted to use. Got green one 128 gb for almost 51.5k and I'd say a good price for it would be bw 45k-50k. The battery performance for normal usage, the video camera, easy to use. Loved it.
And mfs delivered it in 4 frickin days like wtf. But anyways if u are wanting to try apple its worth it buying an year old device lol.",5

2818,Excellent phone,"Excellent phone....my upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S8 is worth it.
Fabulous touch, fast and superb camera on top of it iOS 14 smoothness and features.

However, it is a bit too heavy. Apple should reduce the size a little bit and weight too much.",5
2819,worth the upgrade!,I was using the iphone 7 for the past 3 and half years and this 11 is totally worth the upgrade! Not at all slippery like the 7 though. The battery life is superb! Also received the earphones and the charger as part of the sale.,5

2823,One of the best smartphone,Only one word for this phone - it's a beast. Battery life is really good. I charge it once in 2 days with minimal usage (4-5 hours with personal hotspot on). Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers,5

2828,Best iPhone,"Loving my new phone already, delivered on time, packaging was perfectly fine
Some reviews will say that never buy expensive phones from Amazon, which is absolutely incorrect as I have received my phone the same way I would get it in any store
Had good experience in buying it from Amazon",5

Buy make sure to take a video while unboxing to be on the safer side.",5
2835,Ticks everything that you’d expect a great phone to do.,"Battery life is pretty good. I start my day at around 8 in the morning with 100% charging and end my day at around 10pm in night with around 15-20% battery with a screen time of 5-6 hours. Camera is top notch especially the video quality. 4k videos at 30fps is amazing. Though the phone has only 60hz refresh rate, it is smooth enough. As always, the iOS is pretty perfectly optimised. It’s a very good buy overall.",5
2836,Never buy this garbage,The best crap you can buy in this price point.,1
2837,Don’t have much of a choice,"Best battery life.

Feel and touch - Great.

Overall - Could have been much better.",4
2840,Just go for it.,"Phone is a must buy but the 128 gigs.
Display is fab. Even though it’s a LCD. The only down side is that it’s not so bright as an AMOLED.
Camera wise it has the best lens. Even the front facing cam provides a wide angle.
Upgraded from an iPhone 8 definitely worth the upgrade.
Don’t worry about gaming everything is playable in ultra settings.",5
2841,Bb,"I bougt this iphone 11 from amazon
All was good exept charger
Bcs the charger i got in the box was an old design
The new charger adapter is faster than older nd it is with new desing like (adapter nd its charger wire cnecton point ) is smal

2846,Value for money.,"Got the 128gb variant on the very first day of sale with effective price Rs. 49999/-.

Awesome battery life.
Very good camera but can't say excellent.
Display is not bad but could have been better.

Butter smooth multitasking
A bit of network issues sometimes

Overall it's a very good smartphone and totally value for money in this price
Loved the device.",4
2847,Switching from Andriod to iOS,"I switched to iPhone from OnePlus. Not to say that OnePlus is not a good phone it is one of the best in the market right now. The first thing I noticed is the battery life, it is really really good! I get at least 5-6 hours on it with 20% left. Overall the phone is great and the apps work buttery smooth. I just wish that Apple made cheaper phones to tap the Indian market.",5
2848,Wonderful product and worth upgrading to iPhone 11,Wonderful product worth every money. After good study I bought this phone and met my expectations. No much difference between pro and pro max. If you really like stander quality of iPhone and real feel go for it.,5
2849,"Front camera shots full of noise, unclear.","Selfie camera sucks. Totally full of noise and disturbance, the front camera shots...... Read online forum reviews and found this is a common problem with iphone 11.
The company should fix this through hardware repair or replacements or software updates. Spending so high and getting this feels like being cheated.",2
2850,Don't by it from Amazon.,"I never suggest any single person to buy the iPhone from Amazon....from the first day I'm facing my issues in phone.... like when i opn the camera thn nothing is shown, the screen gets black also I'm took the phn on 17th oct still the battery health has been decreased by 2 precent.....even i used iPhone approx 4-5 hrs in a single day..... I'm very disappointed that this type of services are provided by the Amazon... they make the customers Goofy",1
2851,Great purchase...,"Android user previously, so if you wanna update to iOS just go for this one.
Pros-

-Cameras are just the best
-Display is LCD but you’ll not feel that it’s that good
-The haptics give a premium experience overall

Cons-
Battery life could be slightly better",5
2852,Audio calls are noisy & battery getting drained fast.,"The battery appears to be draining very fast. There is noise disturbance on incoming cellular audio calls making the conversation ununderstable. I am yet to use Camera hence not able to make any comment on the performance of cameras.
Which store I have to visit for getting the iPhone rectified.",3
2853,Great product and great service go for it,"Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed ..its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick ,camera quality is top notch ,battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet",4
2854,good so far,"Just recieved my purple colour iphone11, a good upgrade from iphone 6s to 11. So far the delivery was good and it was well packed with all items intact. Well while buying I did read a few negative comments luckily I didn't face any.
If any one is worrying that the battery might heat up mine didn't.",4
2855,Pure Class!!,"iPhone 11, despite every critic or fan out there, will do one thing. It wouldn’t disappoint you. It keeps up the rock solid performance you’d expect out of an A13 Bionic. It’s camera is unlike any other. Battery life is good, not exceptional. Feels great in the hand. For those confused between product red and black, go for black like me because it’s not too flamboyant and more classy. 128 gb should be decent for most people. Anyone switching from Android to iPhone 11 will have a memorable experience.",5
2856,Reason to buy iphone,"The ios 14 features are way good and better than android os. Complete user friendly phone! Like thats all a user wants to be smooth, precise and secured! Switching from oneplus 3 to here! Packing was good and sealed!",5
2857,Misguiding information.. It's wired earphones,See the earpods.. It's a wired earphones.. Apple and Amazon both together misguiding consumers.. And moreover you will also not get refund from Amazon.. Think twice before purchasing on Amazon.. Better to visit store.. Get physically checked what you going to receive and then purchase.. High value online purchase are really not recommended..,1
2858,A perfect Apple product!,A proud owner of iPhone 11. Everything ranging from hardware to software works amazing. Quality product. Highly recommended.,5
2859,"Original iPhone, Happy buy","Got it on Amazon Oct Sale, including hdfc card discount 64GB model price was Rs 46249 which is good deal if you don’t require AirPods. Initially had trouble with phone not recognising Jio sim but it worked after few retries. 2 days usage review and all works well so far.",5
2860,Camera OK ok... Moved to Android to IPhone,"Worried, Scared, Panicked at last Amazed..... Reviews are good and Thanks for the seller Dharsitha Ashiyana Pvt Ltd Bangalore awesome seller from them for seller 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
For iPhone 11 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",4
2861,Amazingly Powerful Phone!,"I upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 11 and I am loving the new phone. It's very fast, has a great camera, and is extremely easy to use. The battery life is brilliant! The only thing that could have been better is the face recognition feature. Sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the face and you will need to unlock the phone through some other way. Otherwise, it is an amazing phone!",5
2862,Beautiful Device! Loving iOS❤️,"Amazing device! Loved it! The only thing that bugs me is the Heating issue! I suppose it’s with all the iOS devices. Other than that the camera quality, the build quality, the display ( though it’s not LED but produces bright and vibrant colours) everything is gorgeous! My first iOS device and I’m in love with it!",5
2863,Night Mode and iOS make this phone,"iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.

What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.",5
2864,Disappointed,The product description on Amazon said that the package contains EarPods and battery adapter. The package came with only the charging cable. Neither the power adapter nor the EarPods were included. The charging cable isn’t even compatible with other apple adapters. Also the MRP mentioned on the site was significantly higher than the one mentioned on the box.,1
2865,Charger not good,"Everythin about phn is so good.
Only thing that i did not like is the adapter given for charging..
It is of 5W only and it take almost 2.5 to 3 hra to charge your phn to 100%.

When. You are spending so much amount then we should expect from apple to provide with compatible charger as they are giving in pro and max pro..",4
2866,Overall nice quality.,"It's camera is protruded which may get scratches once placed on some object. Also, phone is bit slippery.",5
2867,3 days after delivery - Loving this,"Bought iphone 11 on 20/10/2020. It is a genuine product. Original. The phone is excellent. Loving it.

Camera, FaceID, battery everything works well until now. This phone has typically exceeded my expectations. Also this phone, after the price drop is worth the buy.

Appario is the dealer that delivered. They look genuine. So thanks :)

Go for it. Here's my 5 stars.",5
2868,Iphone is the best phone. The camera quality is superb . User interface is goog,Iphone is the best phone. The camera quality is superb . User interface is good. Phone doesnot slow anytime. Only battery backup is less but is manageable.,5
2869,Very good phone and average delivery,I am writing this review after using it for one day. It cost me around 53k in Sell. I am happy with my purchase camera quality is very good specially in low light and the performance is awesome. I am giving 4 star bcz my box is little damage around corner but still the phone is in good condn.,4
2870,Great deal at good price..!!,"Amazing phone with nice feature set.
Look and feel of it is great. And at 50k price it is worth the go.
Amazon deal is better than apple online store as it provides phone with charger and earbuds.",5
2871,Total Disappointed,Mobile battery getting drain so fast and it's also getting heat,1
2872,Ip11 is still value for money than ip12,Awesome. In the world of ip12 still ip11 shines it if you are looking for an good overall performance.,5
2873,Good phone you can use long time,All good but it's a little heavy and thick as Compares to other models. Others are moving to thinner and slicker models dont know why apple going the opposite way. Performance battery and camera all working as expected,4
2874,Do not buy from Amazon,"Do not prefer to buy on Amazon.
The phone is good but I received it with scratches and fingerprints all over the phone.",3
2875,Just a good phone,"It’s simply a good phone with Apple brand. Good OS optimisation to have a good performance and battery life.
I’m slightly disappointed with the Camera as they are advertising. The main camera picture is good n video is also coming better but selfie is really just okay.
Simply I can say it’s not a camera phone.",4
2876,Worth it!,"Just the right phone for personal use.
Pros: Using it for photography as well and the results are amazing.
User interface, as always feel genuine.
Cons: No adapter inside the package!",5
2877,Great camera but outdated dispaly,"If you are a media consumer like watching a lot of movie and exploring social media content ignore Iphone. But you want a high performance device which has a long durability you can prefer this.

I don't see big flagship feature except camera and processing ability.

I prefer to go with 1+ 8pro if i get a second chance or You already have a good phone then go for Ipad Pro Air 2020 with the same price",4
2878,Its just apple👌🏻,"The phone is awesome. The face recognition system is super fast, camera quality is also amazing. I am just disappointed a bit with charging speed . Otherwise the phone is amazing.",5
2879,Overall Basic review after one week usage.,"Camera Quality is absolutely amazing.
Battery is good compared to previous iPhone models . But if you play high end games like PUBG (continues), you will only get 5-6 hours of battery backup.
Face ID is amazing. A lot of tech youtubers say that display is not good , but believe me you won’t notice any problem with the display.
Night photography is really amazing feature, probably my favourite.
Overall, I will give a 4.8 out of 5.",5
2880,Think before you buy,"Switched from Android to iOS. Pretty hard for couple of days to use it. Its not so simple as android. Very hard to move your data from android to iphone.

Battery Life - It lasts",5
2882,Amazing deal.,"I suggest you should go for this rather than an Android in this price range.
Amazing battery back up(I play games)
Camera is one advantage again.
Plus the notch isn’t a great issue.We just get used to it.
There is no problem at all in user interface

2885,Getting heated,"Looks like quality issue. I see phone is getting heated once you use it for few mins. Never ever buy iPhone from Amazon. Incase you want to replace or return the product with-in the return or replace window, Amazon will say talk to Apple and when you Will talk to Apple, Apple says talk to Amazon. None of the store will replace and return the product. This is pathetic experience. I will raise online complain including Twitter copying Top CIO’S.",1
2886,Good product with limitations and switch back if possible,"Battery life is BAD. In around 40 days “Battery Health” fell to 99% and on 46th day to 98%. Also, getting acknowledgment from Apple’s Support Team of ‘there’s an issue with battery’ is a task as for them battery is behaving normally.

Good product and one should explore seller option just to explore better quality.

I’m honestly thinking of switching back to Android OS considering limitations with Apple’s quality of product.",5
2887,Apple & Android,"My reviews are based on switching from Android to Apple:
Cons:
1. Switching is too difficult, it took hell lot of time to fully recover data (Move to IOS app was used)
2. Not All data got copied
3.Apple Customer Service was not great
4. Samsung S10 is sleek, having 3 cameras, bigger battery.
5. This is heavier & thicker than Samsung S10
6. No fast charging",4

2897,Best iPhone till now,Back to basics I moved from android to iPhone after 5 years and no regrets. Absolutely awesome piece of tech from hardware to software all the small details are kept in mind and handled well. Only thing I miss is fast charger that’s it,5
2898,Software update issues,"Software update ended up with an apple logo frozen screen, apple support was also unable to fix this inspite of multiple attempts and was suggested to get a new product as replacement however amazon doesn’t seem to have this model in stock till December and that’s disappointing as I have also exchanged my old 6s 128 GB phone for this product. It would have been a lot better if the new product is made available soon.",3

Camera: photos are crisp, clear and comes with natural colour.",5
2905,Good one,Phone is quite good. Changed to iphone from oneplus 7. This phone is really nice but I find androids are way more easy to handle and operate. Cameras are best on this device. Audio is good and screen quality is really decent.,5
2906,Marvellous,"Using my device for last 20 days and it’s been a great experience. I switched from Android to iOS and it seems to be a good decision now. Battery, Camera and Performance all are excellent. Display is not so great when compared Oled display in 11pro but still it is better than many Android phones available in market. Face recognition is superfast in any light condition. Only thing that irritates here is 5W slow charger but it keeps your battery health better anyways in hurry situations I’ve to use 12W charger(bought separately). At the end I’m super happy with my phone.",5

They said it might be a hardware problem with the phone. .
It's really sad and disappointing.",1
2981,think twice ...,from the second day i had issues with the sensor i had to change temper glass atleast 5 times in a week and now am using the phone without the glass..better to buy in a store near you for these kinds of sensitive products,3

3030,Nice for 3300 rupee,"I was looking for scanner and printer for home usage (for occasional printing). I decided the hp 2131 which was coasting around 3100 but shortly it became out of stock. So I went for this one and it costed me 3300 on freedom sale.

Prints are clear and also the scanning quality is good I scanned my brother's college id card it was clear . Speed is also good and it is quite light

I will post full review after more testing.",4
3031,Good product for me...,"Good printing.good working.
But,ink problem.....
So,sad...
This is good product.",4
3032,"Good InkJet Printer, but cartridge costs prove uneconomical","HP Printer is very good, no doubt and a buy at the price. The only problem is the ""loss-leader pricing"" of the replacement cartridges which become uneconomical in the long run...",3
3033,Hp DeskJet 2331 printer - Not working,"I won't recommend this. Hardly it worked, it's not at all taking papers for print. Waste of money.",1
3034,Nice product.,"Nice product. As usual printing cost will be high, though i bought it for scanning purpose. Okay for a4 size paper scanning but can't handle a3 or larger. At 300 dpi b/w scanning takes approx 10 second.",5
3035,Unavailable catridge,"Printer catridge 805 not available anywhere including hp store, without catridge the printer is idle no use.please don't cheat people like this.If the product has no support from its manufacturer please don't list it.",1
3036,Printer is good but.....,"Waste of money. Because I had printed around 75 pages with black and white,by that time ink is totally completed. And i didn't find 805 ink cartridges anywhere. Till now .......",1
3037,"For home use, we can definitely buy this product. Good one.",Printer is good. Scan and print quality also good. But setup takes more time to understand the product and installation. I did myself and it's working fine. Thank you Amazon for the good product.,4
3038,Costly print- 11 Rs/pg (b/w) & 21 Rs/pg (Clr),"HP All-In-One Printer price is very attractive but running cost of ink cartridges is very high.
Scanning is good quality but can scan only one page at a time & you need a separate file binder software to merge all files in single document.

Now coming to cost- (discounts can be available occasionally)
Printer HP 2131 costs close to Rs 2,300 (under discount offers)
It uses HP 803 Ink cartridge.
B/w cartridge costs Rs 702 & colour cartridge costs Rs 836

B/w cartridge can print around 60 pages for Rs 702 & colour cartridge can print max 40 pages for Rs 836
thus cost of single print is Rs 11 Rs/page (B/W) & 21Rs/Page (Clr)

HP's claims for number of pages are under economy mode & under lab test conditions - actual user will get above stated numbers
refill kits are available at half prices of original cartridges but quality of colour prints will be compromised.

Thus recommended to purchase only for occasional users with low usage.
Not cost effective for regular & heavy users.

Please also check my review for HP Deskjet 2135 for cost per print

You can encourage me to write further reviews by hitting YES button :)",3
3039,Worst printer available,"A very bad product. I can't imagine HP is selling such a part printer wherein the cost of one print out is almost 10 bucks. The ink cartridges are not even able to print 100 pages and cost of cartridge is 1000 bucks so it's cheaper to get print out from the shop then buy this piece of junk.
We even went to the HP store to sort out this but they have no clue. ( Or sometime ignorance is bliss)",1
3040,USB cable duplicate,"Fantastic delivery by Amazon. BUT STRANGE, was not in normal Amazon packaging???
USB cable faulty, careful study shows a duplicate as no ceramic finish, plus pins are not in line.
Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.
WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.
Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy""",2
3041,Not worth the money. Worst printer.,"Worst printer. Just to check, gave a print for 50 black and white pages. The original cartridge got over. Original 805 model B&W cartridge would cost you around 800/-. Which means one black and white print will cost you 16/-. U can go to a photo shop and get a print on canvas at this price. Worst printer. I regret as there is no return only replacement. Please don't get cheated.",1
3042,Decent printer but replacement cartridge difficult to buy,"Good decent printer. But difficult to find replacement cartridges. Made huge mistake by buying this printer.

May be have the printer as show piece.",2
3043,"waste of money, better buy a second hand printer from some where.","waste of the money to buy this printer, the link will just dry within 2 weeks if you are not using it, the new cartridge cost is very high , you buy 2 cartridge at the same cost of printer, the cost of printer ink is more then human blood. better use your own blood for printing it will be much cheaper",1

Now coming to the main topic. I got HP Deskjet 2131 Printer at just ₹2699 during republic day sale.

It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!). The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.

3048,If u r not fool u will not buy this printer,"Don't ever buy this printer...instead go for ink tank ones...although this one is cheaper the ink cartridges will cost you the same amount in which u can buy a new printer again... not worthy from such a big brand HP...they made the printer price less but kept cartridge price the highest among all of its range...simply fooling customers..
even cannot use any other cartridge and refilling was also complex.. sometimes works sometimes not :(",1

Also the main box was opened and over it there was a plastic tape put to show as if it was original seal u can make out with just the packing

3052,Good product but not the best,"Build quality is great, the design and colour looks great, printing cost is little high as it Is an inkjet printer so if you need a printer like for occasional use like in project time then you should go for it, else go for laser If only blank and white print is needed, else inktank, also keep a track of this printers price, as it keeps going up and down when i ordered it costed me around 3.9k but somedays later it was 3.7k so keep checking if you can wait for like 1 week or more then order from the official hp site, there you'll get it for more reasonable price, also the no external packaging was done or given in this printer which is bad, what if it got damaged during shipping, it would result in the seller losing money and also I'll end up losing my time and maybe money if i found the damage later on like internal or if i don't have a recording of me unboxing it and found it damaged, something like that.",4

3058,there is a major flaw in design it self,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice",1

About the printing, good for few prints but really this is not a heavy duty printer. For serious printing and printing too many papers, go for some higher version or a laser jet. This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.
Print quality: good but not for heavy use
Scan: Good and it does it's job.
Durability: not that good for heavy printing, good for scanning. Body of the maching is not that heavy and not that sturdy.
Installing: very easy to install, nothing special engineering really needed.",3

3069,Print quality is awesome but it's not at all worth !,"I purchased this product in 2017 during Amazon sale. This printer is very easy to use and very friendly but cartridge is the biggest issue. With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

Think well before you buy this printer.",1
3070,A good all-in-one product,The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.,4
3071,Good printer in this price range for home use.,"Good printer for home use.
1. Very easy to install and use. Installation directions comes with product.
2. This printer has no WiFi functionality. Hence, needs to be connected with laptop/desktop with a cable while printing.
3. Print speed is ok, not great (very fast)
4. Double side printing is not automatic. Need to manually feed the pages back to printer if we need printing on both sides of the page.
4. Copy (Photostat) functionality is good. Can copy both in color and black&white.
5. Scan functionality is also good. Once the necessary drivers are installed as part of the installation and printer is added to laptop/desktop, one will understand how to use the scan functionality.",5

If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2.

If u are looking for an office use or you will use it everyday then this product is not for you...
I would recommend you to go for other options

3077,Great quality,"Pros
-Print quality is really great.
-Print speed is fast compared to its previous models.
-Installation is very easy.
-Works with OTG cable in Android
-Lightweight
-Good Build quality

Cons
-Works with OTG cable in Android (However you cannot adjust the print size or quality. It just prints a single image on full size page)
-The software immediately displays the ink levels as half empty even if you just printed a single page.
-Ink is too damn costly.

If you have an occasional use of coloured printing, go for it. It's the best in price range. But for regular use it'll put a whole in your pocket.",5

3081,Terrific purchase,"One of the worst purchase i have ever got from amazon..reasons to justify are as below.
1)First of all the outer box is not completely sealed..
2)printer is not a brand new one,its a product returned by someone..we can clearly see the invoice of others..
3)both the ink catridges are missing from this peice.
How can someone dispatch an used item and more over without even seeing wether box has all the products.
Terrific customer experience.",1
3082,Good product at this price tag,"I have used HP printer in past but that was long time ago and now this is my 2nd HP printer. Overall the product is good at this price tag, but I am sure some improvements can be done to enhance user experience. Fit and finish of product is good and is light weight.
1) Installation software needs to be downloaded from HP website and installation is smooth. Software is not very user friendly though
2) I faced issue with my 1st print as after installation of software it was just not printing. But later is started printing after a reboot and about 15 mins
3) Print quality is ok and bit slow, as we expect from a Deskjet printer. (Please don't compare print quality with Laser printer)
4) Scanning is good, scans perfectly but its slow (specially with high DPI). I faced one issue with the software wrt scanning. I can save a PDF with multiple pages in 200 DPI but it does not work with 600 DPI. Maybe HP can provide a resolution or improve the software
5) Last but not the least, Ink cartridges. I am sure these small cartridges with the printer won't even last 100 pages. Most of my printing is black, but even a black one will not last 100 pages. So buying new cartridges at 600-800 per piece is a rip off. Better deal with refilling to have economical printing

Overall its a good product.",4
3083,Good product,"Great product at a very attractive price. Good for basic home use. Easy to install.! Colour prints are also nice quality.
Scan is easy and not noisy .",5
3084,It comes with setup cartridges and not ink cartridges,"I was using an HP 1515 all-in-one printer for several years but it got stuck with a paper jam problem. It did not have any setup cartridges, but this 2331 printer is having them. Instead of simplifying setup, HP is making it more and more complicated. Since the setup cartridges are to be thrown out after a 5-minute use, they only serve the purpose of eco-unfriendliness. I can manage with this 2331 because I am running a one-man business.",1
3085,Above average,"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have.",4
3086,Both service and product are pathetic,"After 3 days of purchasing the color printing not working properly and only the pink color is print on paper.

3087,Never go for Hp inkjet printers.,"Giving review after 3 months view..

Never ever in ur life ,even if by mistake dont think about buying this inkjet or deskjet type printers of Hp.Hp is chinese.and we know china and chinamall.
I dont know about ink tank printers but yes this type of inkjet is a total waste of ur money and time.

My hp 2131 printer lasted around 3 months only with so many messy things ,
Printed 40 pictures with the demo catridges.
Next 300 pages with refilled ink of good quality.
Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers.",1
3088,Good budget printer,"Using this printer from one month without problem. Quality is good when printed with normal mode. Have not used draft or high quality mode yet.

Printed 12 colour pages and more than 50 black and white till now. Can't comment about the cartridge life.

Color print speed is much slower than black and white print, but it's ok for me because I don't need many colour prints.

Overall a good budget printer.",5
3089,Not Recommended,"It's low cost printer but maintenance (running cost) is too high. Printing cost is approx Rs. 8-10 per page for Black and white and Rs. 10-12 for color printing because cartridge will cost you Rs. 700 (B&W) and 850 for color.
Or, If you are thinking you will refill your cartridge then you can't, because HP Smart app will deduct that cartridge and you can't print with that you have to purchase new cartridge after printing 50-60 Pages.
Hope It will Help you to select right printer for your need.",1
3090,Quality printer.,"The printer is working good.
We bought it in diwali offer. For this much lesser price , the printer is working very very nice. The quality is so good. Thanks to Amazon and HP. I bought it for my dad while I use another HP LaserJet p1007 printer. Both the printers r working well.
Initially I had little problem in installing this deskjet printer to iball 8"" tablet PC. The printer model/ type was not showing initially. But the problem is rectified now. Still I have to find the way to ""scan"" the printer in the tablet pc even after installing the HP smart app. I don' have much time.
Still I have yet to try the cloud printing or it would be better if HP helps to make work the scanning function. The other 2 functions (print and copy) r working fine.

3091,Best printer and low rate but price per page is to costly for home use only,I purchased this 6 months ago. I purchased it for my personal use at home. But I did a big mistake. The reason not to buy are : -1.paper get stuck: - first few month it was smooth experience but after that whenever I wanted print the paper gets stucked in the middle of the printer. Then I have to manually remove page from printer.2. Unpleasant noise : - printer makes a unpleasant noise while printing. It gives feeling that the printer has been damaged. First time I was scared by this noise.3. Poor quality of print : - the quality of print is not at all good. This is a ink printer.4. Costly cartilage : - they are must expensive black cost 800 and colour cost 1000.then don't work even 1 month properly.Note : - don't buy this printer.you should buy the new generations printer this is very costly and not effective.BELIEVE ME.,2
3092,GOOD PRINTER,This is third HP printer that I have purchased. I had HP deskjet 1050. Only Rollers create problems may be due to more wear and tare. But company may take care of quality. Second big hurdle is the refill problem. Cartridge too small and costly and suddenly exhausted. In emergency unavailable immediately. Working hampers as nobody can count pages printed. Otherwise printer is awe sum.,4
3093,Best printer in this range.,"This printer is a very cool deal in this price point. You can print , scan and copy easily. I personally liked this product. It is best suitable for home use. However printing rate is a little slow but it produces high quality prints.
Based on my observations, I can say that -
1) Printing speed - 7/10
2) Print quality - 10/10
3) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/10
4) Durability - 9/10
5) Scanning - 10/10
6) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10

One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.
Otherwise everything is good.",5
3094,"Quite affordable, good print quality but cartilage dries up if not used on daily basis","I bought it at very affordable price of 2500₹. It's really easy to install. One can search for installation process on YouTube and then follow the procedure. Print quality is too good. The best feature is that it's 3 in one printer which can print, scan and copy. The thing I didn't liked much about it is cartilage which may dry up so you need to use the printer in every 2-3 days. All the cartilage can finish after printing 100 pages. It's good for those who use it for personal home use.",5
3095,"Low-priced Printer, Low-quality Printing","If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3
3096,Making fool by HP,"Printer is budget product for home use, but original ink is a big scam, 2 Rs. manufacturing cost of product has MRP Rs. 754/-. And local ink refill will not work every time, Sometimes cartridge will failed, some time printer will block the cartridge. and indicator light will blink continuously. Reset and other tricks available in youtube will not work once cartridge blocked.",1
3097,For first time printer user; wants to print at home on your own,"ABOUT THE PRINTER:-
user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.
2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.
HOW TO INSTALL:-
so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.
1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.
2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.
3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!

hope it helped :)",5
3098,Erroneous Product (paper jam issue),"Defective product. After installation almost I have wasted my 2 hours with HP team for getting my problem resolution of paper not loading.. and they have assigned an engineer for resolution of the same ...

25-Jan-2021: As per HP care Team product is faulty and needs to be replaced.
27-Jan-2021: Replacement product received. Which is also faulty and now a refund is initiated.

In case you want to waste you 1 week for this long process go ahead and purchase this trouble box.",1
3099,The HP Smart app / driver is anything but smart,"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1
3100,Overall a Good product at the price of 3K,"On time delivery by Amazon. Print quality is GOOD, on par with any other printer at this price range. But canon mg2570s & mg2577s are cheaper & comes with cheaper cartridges (something I observed).
It takes some time for the Scanning & printing process but thats normal for home use & even OK for small home business uses. The lid hinge looks & feels quite flimsy though.
Installation process was hassle free. Online Registration was swift. Hp's app is super easy to use just uninstall the bloatware ;)
Refill cartridge is some what expensive but thats inevitable with any inkjet printer (no point in blaming only hp for that) but canon's 745s black & 746s color cartridges are relatively cheaper, (around 200/- less)

Overall Good product, at the price of 3K it gets the job done without any trouble.",4
3101,"Best in price, awesome in quality","Best in this price. Budget friendly.
The print quality is awesome for colour and black and white print both.
We never used printer before but installation was very easy.
Yes, print speed is bit slow but we don't need to open a shop, in 3400 INR it serves more than it needs to be. Scanner is awesome and fast too. I am truly satisfied with the purchase.
It is being used frequently by all of us in our family.",5
3102,Satisfied and works fine,Everything works fine and printing quality depends on the ink. The stock cartridge ink works like charm. The color cartride after 3-4 refills stops detecting by the printer even when it's full with ink which I think is a scam of printer business. But the black cartridge still works whenever it got empty I refill it and it's works. The printer works with single cartridge too! But the cartridge are very costly to buy,5
3103,"Good and value to money product, ideal for your home uses........","Printing quality really amazing. Ink consumption is bit more, but it is ignorable. It is not so handy for office heavy duty use. Now in the present situation of Work from home condition it is good fit. Do not take much of space, easy to set up. Ink cartridges are costly. No installation CD or support is supplied with the instrument. One have to download the driver online. That's become a big challenge sometime. Aesthetics and Printing efficiency are good.",5
3104,Money saver,Really i must tell you this junk here is amazing i mean who the hell can give you hd printout at such a low price and it's a complete machine with print scan and copy and really easy to install there are two methods of software installation one is online and second is offline both are easy you should go for this,5
3105,Do not buy if u dont want to spend thousands,Horrible horrible when it comes to cartridge. Printing is good quality only if you install orginal original cartridge if you try to refill the cartridge with different ink things was really messy each cartridge cost 750 rupees so you can understand how expensive the cartridges are. it gives only max to max 100 page of good printing.,1
3106,This will make you rage,"Please read till end , trust me please don't buy this , after one cartridge is empty if 164 prints are done from one cartridge it will show empty cartridge and one cartridge costs 1200 and if you use this printer so rarely the ink will dry up or if you refill an empty cartridge it will not print anything and buying new cartridge everytime it drains up it will cost you 2400 per month , it's better to buy a expensive printer rather than buying a cheap hp one and later knowing we were scamed it and even now you are not convinced than try printing some images of 2K and above it will print them near to 720 p there's no reason to buy this awful thing",1
3107,"If you have Cartridge shop, then Buy this printer.","I think it's a stupidest buy of my life.

I got this Printer at 2400/- odd, I was very happy but soon I got to know about this fraud.

Printer they are selling at 2400/- and guess what it's cartridge is worth rs. 1500 /-(If you are buying Colour Cartridge as well).

The maximum pages 50 it has given. Till now I have brought 4 cartridges worth rs. more than 4k which more than cost of this printer.

It can only be successfully used as a Scanner.

Be smart and research about what I am saying.

These cartridge wont last even 1 month.",2
3108,Good printer for home,"Printer setup and configuration is pretty easy. The cartridge life is really poor. For me it exhausted after printing about 40 to 45 pages. Both the black and the colour cartridges exhausted. Other than that, if the paper gets jammed, you have to be really careful to take it out from the printer because it may damage the interior ribbons. Print quality is really good at this range and photocopy is also good.",4
3109,"Not cost effective, not sustainable","It's ink is very expensive, when you're a regular user and daily you need lots of pages to print, it's not at all cost effective.
One time cartridge prints only 100-120 pages or even less and you've to buy new cartridge worth ₹900(approx) .
For 100 pages-₹900??
Is that worthy??
Not at all
Please don't buy this and opt for sustainable options on which you can rely upon in future.
Hope it helps.",1
3110,Driver installation is pain in the a**.,"Its a hell of a task for this printer getting ready for your use. The drivers installation process is quite cumbersome and ""cherry on top"" the software HP Smart is not detecting the printer. ( Now using other HP software which finally detected the printer.)
Also not much of an assistance is available on internet to help you troubleshoot. You are on your own.",4
3111,Another satisfied customer.,"Wanted a colour printer for the longest time without knowing it. I wanted it for printing study materials, and doing some official works like photo copying.

This machine does it all. Im really satisfied. Its like one of the things that makes life easier.

If u r in a dilemma, don't be... U can go for it",4
3112,Totally waste of money,"Honestly speaking I buyed this product as it was best selling product ... After a day use, its cartridge goes empty and I ordered ink worth of 500 to fill this ... And after filling it also goes to empty after 60 pages and after filling again it was not doing the printing so I have to order a new cartridge worth 717 and then after 60 pages it again goes to empty and the printer is not doing well and taking out only empty pages ..... Totally waste of money .... I prefer not to buy this .....",1
3113,Waste of Money,"If actually U count. It comes to 6-8 Rs/print on one side only.
Plus the cartridge though they say it prints 180 pages/cartridge. Mine works only for 100 max even without pictures/diagrams which might be considered uses more ink.....
Only advantage is i can print whenever i want. Whatever i want. Apart from that, its a waste...... Though product works great.....",1
3114,I'm disappointed,Within a week it's paper jam issue started. Hp technical person saying nonsense things. It printed only 20 page. N he saying yes sir it's only 20 page giving cartridge is empty. After we bought new cartridge again it strucked now he's saying it's not cover in warranty. I purchased this just 15 days back it completely waste of money and time. Hp is worst support. I do not recommend this product don't buy this brand it's just a brand u can't get any support.,1
3115,Decent Printer,"I have been using this printer for about 2 months. So far no problems. I think it’s a good printer available for this price. Although loading cartridges initially required a little force, it was smooth after that. I reduced one star because printing both sides can be little tricky as you have to insert it once again with one side printed . The other side may be upside down if you are not careful.",4
3116,Good but costly in maintenance,"This product does printing and scanning well. Works as expected. Main problem comes is the ink cartridge. If you shop online original cartridge, it costs ₹800 and more ( for small black catridge that yields just ~190 pages ). That's more costly if you are taking more print out or copy. If you take less pages and do scan, then this is good for you.",5
3117,This printer is a good product and is suitable for domestic use,"I would like to say that it was very easy to install the printer and it's easy to use it. However, I would like to mention that the ink is not too much and after 120 pages it's not possible to print out any document with a high quality. Anyway, it's a good product for personal use. If you want to buy something for office, I don't recommend this printer because it's made for personal and domestic use. It's an all-in-one made for home. Good product!",4
3118,Expensive prints,"Printer is good, no complaint but cost of printing makes us cry(i put least quality prints). While buying we think we dont take much prints but that opinion does not last long. Go for ink tank even if budget does not permit.",3
3119,"Vaue for money cost effective printer, great for moderate home use","If you are looking for a cheap printer for home use, for school work, hobbies etc, and you print about 50-80 pages per month, this is the best one available in the market for that. All in one printer in less than Rs 3000 is a steal indeed. Very easy to set up, just download the drivers from hp website before hand.
Color print at draft setting comes put with lines , so keep that in mind.",3
3120,Great buy for the budget range,"Yet to install.but basic functions are great.3300while ordered and had to pay 3.5k.only wish this lasts for a while, unlike other Chinese products.wanted a sturdier fibre built, seems more of a plastic variety :(",4
3121,Waste of money,"Did not work well, could print only 5 black and white pages and stopped printing after that. Color prints were also not good from day 1 itself. Need to take it to nearest HP shop now to check whats the issue. Updating the review again .... in total in printed 78 pages only, after this HP forcing to buy new cartridge for 800 which will print 100 pages,,, so per page print cost is 8 on top of money paid to buy the printer... third class useless product",1
3122,Decent printer. Good for domestic use.,"Decent print quality. Good option for thr price point compared to other HP printers.
Takes a little extra time to print but is not disappointing.
The software to control the printer is quite a hassle but nothing impossible to get through.

Installation was mostly automatic and a merely 5min procedure.

Happy to have bought this for domestic use.",4
3123,Don't Buy. Printing cost is not afford any one 10 to 12 rs for B&W,"Don't Buy Only 90 Black&White Pages can print with one cartridge.
I was take wrong decision to select this printer.
When you going to purchase new cartridge it's cost is 700 to 800 rs.
You can't refill cartridge
Don't believe on YouTube video I tried many times but it's not working.
I suggest to HP plz low down cartridge price .
Now one Print cost using with this printer is about 10 to 12 rs for Black & White.
Any one want to buy this printer plz read my review carefully and also watch YouTube review",1

BUT
the printer costs 3,299
with cartage
and after like 20-25 prints the black&white cartage is over & now throw that cartage in the garbage and but a new 800 rupees cartage.
same with the colour cartage but the change is colour cartage costs 1200 rupees",3

3126,Never Buy Cheap Quality Printers.,"Never buy cheap printers. This is totally a scan big printer giants sell printers for small amount of money. Because their main agenda is to sell ink cartridges and that where they earn money from.

This is the cheapest junk you can buy. It stopped working after 6 months and got repaired in warranty, then again it stopped working after 13 months and now HP is asking 5000 rupees to repair it. Plus it is a ink guzzler printer one cartridge barely prints 70 black page. And 30-40 coloured prints max out.",1
3127,Very good buy & really worth the money spend,Good product bit model is obselete in the market is what I came to know. Very easy to install & it’s plug and play type. There is no CD along with for installation & ths drivers could be downloaded online. Depends on the system config is takkrion process becomes easy. For windows 10 it takes few minutes but other system it might take a few minutes. But print & product quality is excellent & worth buy for a house. Reccomend this product for sure.,4
3128,For occasional printing this is fine otherwise it is expensive then it looks,"The printer is not useful unless you going to print 5 or 10 pages a month
Pros-
Print quality is good
Easy to install
Cons-
The ink is very expensive , the first time we have printer around 30 or 40 pages then we had to buy a black ink catridge which is around 750
When printing in bulk it does not print the pages correctly, eg if I give page 15 to 20, it prints some random pages like13, 17 and all
Paper feeding mechanism is not that good, you may have to keep adjusting it",2
3129,A great all-in-one with the usual downside of cartridge prices,"What's good about the all-in-one?
• It costs only ₹3000.
• The scanner is so silent I feared it wasn't working at all.
• The prints come out good.

What's bad?
• For a ₹3000 printer, the cartridges cost around ₹2000. Just increase the cartridge cost to ₹3000 and I can buy printers instead and sell the old one for cashback.
• The provided cartridges barely have any ink. Few prints and they're out.",4
3130,Scam,"The ink hardly lasts 30 pages , specially the back cartridge.
Combined Ink refill cost is more than printer and they are hardly available.

3132,Cartridge are not available and are very expensive....stay away from,This is a one of great scam....the printer is less expensive ....but the cartridge are tooooo expensive....and slowly you get habitual with print....and you want more and more categories....and now the cartridge are not available in the market....owned and controlled by company,1
3133,Really bad experience,"The print quality is okay but the real problem lies in the catridge after 30 prints it showed low ink when we try to take the diagnostic pages it gives clear print but then u can't give a print frm ur pc and u can't take a copy as well regret the purchase, so I am updating after use and I replaced the catridges and the printer is still not working go for other companies the repair guy also hasn't arrived even after complaining to the company",1
3134,Beware read this before you purchase..,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Not worth it I paid more than 3000/- for it installation was not easy for a begginer or first timer. Print quality not that good average. Print cost is very high as just by printing 8 colour print catrage is empty. Pathetic will for sure return.",1

It's like scam . I don't know what to do now. Friends think twice before go with HP products . They making us fool.",1
3137,I want that the company should give the printer to me in working condition,It seems the black ink cartridge was already dried up .Few prints were taken and the impressions were very light and then it stopped altogether.Now I am getting my print work done from market.The colour cartridge dose not print black & white work at all.There is some problem. I did have two copies printed of my vaccination certificate with colour where in PM’s photo was in colour.No technical staff ever responded my call. The printer is lying like a monument.If approved I would like to return it and buy some other model or else cartridges be replaced and also technical assistance provided to ascertain serviceability of the printer.,2
3138,seller should check this,"The product I received that is the printer, was not sealed (I am saying that the printer is not sealed not the packaging ), the thermocol packaging inside the box is broken into pieces, there were no ink cartages, there is no manual or any quick start guide, there was no software cd or DVD, the printer is not taped also. It was definitely either a defective or a used product. The seller should make sure about the quality of the product. I have purchased a lot of products from amazon and this happened to me for the first time. It is really disappointing and it will create a bad impression on the seller.",1

Paper is getting jammed and nothing is printing. tried the basic self help from HP website. Still the paper is getting jammed. I need to contact HP for service and support, I do not have much time for the run around with the service center, tried calling the service center they are not picking the call. I don't know if I am calling the right number. The rating is purely for the product.",1
3141,Lack of speed!!,"If u have enough money and no mens to use that money then buy it, and waste all ur money by spending on the costly ink-catridge. If you try to refill it with other ink ur catridge will get damage someday. So my suggestion is not to buy it. I should research on it before buying it. Anyway it's now a decorating item in my room since I can't afford that costly ink-catridge.",3
3142,Becareful they are fooling us,"Print quality 8/10
Installation 10/10
Using 10/10

Now I found the reason why hp is buying this good printer for low price, if you want to print pictures this is just a scam. If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing.",2
3143,5- point HONEST review.,"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2
3144,Worst product by HP and worst service by amazon,I bought this product from amazon. after install I found out that its driver is not available on HP site. I tried to refund but amazon customer agent didnt allow and pushed me to install HP Smart and told that it will work with that. BUt it didnt work. Now amazon is saying that refund window is closed and I can not return this useless product. I dont know where to reach it to refund or get it working....,1
3145,Best printer for solving student purpose !,"First of all, if you're a student who wants a printer for printing study materials, for e.g. notes and assignments, then surely go for it..It also comes with inbuilt scanner, so you can download and print registeration or entrance forms, and easily upload with the scanning option..
Yeah, the cartridge proves to be very uneconomical; So better if you refill the catridge at the right time( when the ink level is low but not dried up )... I suggest you to get a prodot ink bottle and you can easily fill upto 20 times..

3150,Useful Printer for limited printout in home.,Product is nice one no doubt about it and very easy easy to use. Print out a bit costly as per print cartridge cost. But one we are using for home use and every now and then print out is not required so it worthy in this view. Print and copy quality is beautiful only thing you have to use original everything...hope you understood. Rest all ok. Very easy to install.,4

3152,An All in one printer at an affordable price. Easy to use.,"It's definitely worth buying this printer especially if your needs are relatively simple. This printer is essentially a simple all in one printer with copy, print, scan features. The printer comes with HP Inkjet cartridges. You have to feed paper from its back. It's very easy to use once you've done the setup right.
There's one pain point though i.e. the printer does not come with any software disk. I had to search online and download the right printer driver for my PC to make it work.",4
3153,Caution!,"I now understand why it’s priced so low. The description sells you quality but starting from installation, the paper tray and it’s alignment to the quality of print - it’s as cheap as the price. I would recommend future buyers, to at least see the quality of print, before you buy this product. After comparing the print from a cannon printer, I feel a bit short changed.",1
3154,Very good printer for home use,"Have been using the printer for about a month. It's very good for home use. I'm sticking to original ink cartridges for the time being as the refill procedure provided in the after-market cartridge and ink seemed too cheap and prone to spillage. Even otherwise, original cartridges are easy to use and affordable for home use, when you consider the trouble of going to a shop to get printouts and the cost you pay there.",5
3155,Cheap price but heavy maintenance....think twice before purchasing,"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty",3
3156,Good but costs more to print.,"Print quality is good. The ink that comes with the printer is demo one, good for around 25 bw and around12 color pages. After that, the new ink cartridges are costly. Almost 12 rupees per bw and 20 rupees per color sheet. If you use it frequently to do not go for this.",3
3157,Cartridge is very small.,"Don't buy this product you will regret in future.
Although it's price is 3500-3700 but it will cost you 8000-9000 in future.
After printing only 50-60 page the cartridge will be empty and you will have to buy new one as it is not refillable.
Cost of new cartridge is between 650-800.
So after every few days you will require new cartridge.
And there is only one cartridge of color (not three for the three colors).
So atlast after changing cartridge once you will regret your decision.",1

3162,The printer doesn't print back to back it prints manually,"Print quality is ok.. Not good for printing on smooth surfaces because ink does not dry. Not good for printing on both side u need to change paper manually. Color cartage gets over in 50 pages black and white in 65 print speed is slow 3 color paper per minute 5 back and white per minute. Scan takes 5 minutes.. But the thing is every function works it is all in one printer
If u refill it with fake turbo inks the printer finds it and the printer software shows there is no ink.. But it can print..",3
3163,Best product for few copies.,"Nice product at this price range.

3166,Get cheated with the cartridge. 10 color print & it's all ready low.,"Got the printer on 30th May, hardly printed 10 color copies & on 8th June got notified the printer is low on cartridges. It's not a fare deal at all.

If you use a good quality paper results are extraordinary.
A few cons.
1. The stock carterage is terrible it's a very poor quality.
2. Carterages are not reusable
3. I received a damaged carterage.
4. Cost cutting is highly observed over the printer.
5. Also no proper information on how to use the printer via laptop",5
3168,Worth buying!!,"Pros:
Easy to install and setup.
Black & white print quality is good based on the printing quality you choose.
Print, Copy, Scan options available.
Good build quality.
Good for home purpose who takes print occasionally.

Ordered this from ""Appario Retail Private Ltd"".
Product was delivered without power cable and ink cartridge.
Packing was in bad condition with parts missing and so I returned this product immediately
When the product was replaced second time, then also defective product sent and it was not printing anything in color...HP print software was clearly showing defect on my laptop...wasted my time on this...",1
3171,GOOD PRODUCT,Excellent product and worth the buy. Was at a good discount and certainly won't get the price anywhere in market. Also this printer was even available second-hand on Amazon for INR 700 cheaper but saw how disturbed customer's were after receiving it. Totally worth not being stingy and buying this new. Has taken care of all my needs and redefined convenience!,5
3172,Extremely inferior material,Absolutely worthless product. Within 15 days the product started malfunctioning. Worst part is the ink. It runs maximum 100 pages in a single cartridge. Paper jam is another problem. Nothing is good about this printer. Why even #Hp manufactures such product which wear outs within a week or two. It is not even worth 1000/- rupees. It is absolute junk piece in the name of printer.,1
3173,Fast and Most Efficient BASIC printer,"PROS

3. Speed around 8-10 page/ min (black and white)
4. Color Printing also nice
CONS
1. Printer sound
2. Vibration

4. No double side Printing

Go for it if you are to print 50-100 page per month. Use Draft mode(b&w) for less ink consumption.",5
3174,Dont go by looks. This is a nightmare,"Bought this for my kid who will have to print a lot of notes. Other than the looks , nothing is what it seems. Fragile to handle.The back-end support is not stable.It takes the precision of a surgeon to main the paper in the exact position so as to be picked up my the roller to print. Print speed is too slow. If you want to print 50 pages or so , dedicate half day of yours for that. Waste of time and money. Returning it in the first 3 hours.",1
3175,Stupid service by HP service centre,Not even got 40 copies with given black cartridge. Problem within 4 weeks of purchase. When we called costumer service they have raised a complaint and given phone number with address of the service centre. Stupid service and they didn't even picking the call that to for a week time. Such irresponsible person and service,1
3176,Bold review,The ink tank printer is easy to handle. And pretty much good quality of print. Issue is only when you realise once ink got finished filling with suitable similar ink that's a head ache.Because the ink cartridge is too expensive than the real printer itself.,4
3177,Product is very good and cartridge quality is low,Product of the hp is very nice and but only disadvantages of this product is ink cartridge of black and tricolor is very high price.don't think is very High quality product.If you want best product go for tank ink jet printer,5
3178,Feel cheated.,"The 803 cartridge which is used in this printer claims 150 prints but even with economy settings my black cartridge finished with 30 prints.
Now, to keep my warranty alive, i cannot use compatible ink, i can only use HP cartridge priced at around Rs. 800. High price to pay for 30 pages. I feel i have been scammed by HP.",2
3179,Best product in this price,"I dont know why people are writing negative reviews about this product. This is purely for occasional use at home. The print quality is amazing (both b/w and colour), easy to set up and use. You just need to download the driver and all set for use. I will recommend this product for home and occasional office usage. Best product in this price range.",5
3180,Not satisified,"Product seems average. Was given a product by the seller where the seal was broken , installation CD was missing. I tried to place a replacement request but instead I am asked to contact HP for missing accessories. Isn't it the basic requirement to provide an untampered product by the seller ?",1
3181,I want to answer from amazon.,"Print quality not good, I think item was opened or used somewhere. And ink cartridge already installed. Ink cartridge also damaged and it will seen as used. Overall I think it will be used used product. I want to answer from amazon about this product.",1
3182,Good printer for home use,"I got this all in one printer during the lockdown period for my WFH requirements. Happy to report the printer is super easy to install and use.

This printer can print on 20 instead of 120 that is really breaking the trust of customers and at the time of replacing they firstly offer replacement and after that they cancel it
I am feel very unhappy to buy this because of quality and the service of Amazon

3184,The Color catridge is malfunctioning,I was bale to take only one clor phpto print on a phot paper .After printing a single photo the Color Ink indicator is blinking was therafter not able to take a single print. To take black print out now I have to take the color catridge out and then take Black print out . Unable to take Color printouts thereafter. God know whether the original catridge got damahed or the Printers Color printing assembly. Awful product experience.,2
3185,New printer sold with fake cartridge,Bought hp deskjet printer a month back. Recently i am unable to take black and white print. Contacted hp service online & then informed my print problem to HP service executive. In turn they advised me to contact local service centre of hp for replacement. Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it’s setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It’s unethical & not expected from hp,1
3186,"It's All purpose Print, Scan and Copy","Amazon No complaints with the H.P. Desk jet 2131 printer. It has scanner & copier also.
3 in 1. That is print, scan & copy. Working smoothly no complaints.
It's a value for money. Only the printer driver has to be downloaded from the Internet. N. Srinivasan",4
3187,Sometimes the printed alignments is not correct while printed,"After 3 months of usage , an writing this review , sometime the pages we print are not printed in correct manner on A4 papper , sometimes the alignment is not correct while printed in A4 , and some time a small portion is sliced off at bottom or edges while printing. Scanning is fine, Overall an average printer, okay with it but not the best one in my opinion , for the price which i bought it is doing my needs and iam okay with it.",3
3188,Nice,The product is great. Produces nice and crisp prints. The only downside is the cost of the cartridges. End of the day you will be spending more on the cartridges than the printer.,4
3189,getting toner error,"I printed only one paper the first time I used. the second time, I got toner error and had no clue what the issue was..

Think before you buy...",1
3191,Good for home use but not good and very costly for long-term use,Print quality is good but the problem is that a colour cartridge can print only 65-70 pages and black cartridge can print 70-80 pages . After that we need to buy a new hp original ink cartridge which cost about 1400-1600 rupee ..... Its really costly for longterm use..,4

3193,Chines product and no user manual in English accept chines language,As per my opinion the said product is directly imported from China and keep in ware house no PDI/No checking done and also not inserted the user manual in Indian language or English language. and deliver to Indian customers,1
3194,You cannot refill and use old cartridge for long run.,Don't Buy cartridge printers. It will cost you much much higher in long run after 2 to 3 years if you compare between (both cartridge-printer + all the cartridge you have purchased) and (inktank-printer + all ink) you will find out ink tank is much cheaper . Better go for inktank. Never think you can refill and use old cartridge HP blocks old cartridge after it's ink get empty. Printer will not detect refilled cartridge.,1
3195,Home printer for Limited use,A good economical home use all in one printer. Ink levels will go down quickly. This is strictly for those who want occasional printing or scanning or xerox. This is not a printer for bulk printing.,4
3196,No one purchase this item,Print quality is very bad as the black cartriage slot not printing properly and only coluor printing slot work. Installation is very hard as the i was applied engineer for installation after 6 hours long time printer installed and not easy to use as the cartriage daily empty.,1
3197,"Great product, thank you HP","Great product at this price range. Best product for home use and easy to use.

Quite easy to install and great product for kid's school projects. I would definitely recommend this product. Go for the product without any second thought. I have been using this for last 3 months with non issues.",5
3198,Not So Happy,Print quality is very good but scan quality is not upto the mark... installation is not at all user friendly they need to give driver oftware CD....if you are not computers savy you will then face the heat while installing this printer,3
3199,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH APPLE COMPUTERS!,"This is a simple, old school, wired printer for light, basic use. Haven't had it long, so can't comment on print yield, etc but it is straightforward to set up, *as long as you are using it with Windows devices"". HP customer service is pathetic and humans there are incredibly difficult to access... I will not be buying HP again.",3
3200,Printing Issues Facing,"I have received the product and looks nice. I tried to install the device but there are lots of issues. Mainly driver is not getting installed. After that I have contacted customer support team to assist for the installation and it got installed.

Not sure why I am having this issue, If i am trying to print multiple document it is not possible. After the first file got completed need to restart the printer to print the next pages.

Any one know how to fix it?",2
3201,Paper feed troubles,"Looks good , prints well but there is a big problem in the way it pulls in the paper. Mostly paper doesn't get pulled in one go and one has to repeatedly push and keep pressing the feed button. For heavy users, this may get really frustrating and also compromise the life of buttons. Didn't expect such substandard quality from HP.",3
3202,Sleek n Nice,"It is smaller in size than my earlier HP printer. All the 3 functions viz, print, scan and copy are working fine. The only problem I faced so far is that the paper does not go smoothly in its slot. The printing is also slower than expected",4
3203,Printer is good but the Cartridge is way expensive,"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3
3204,"Cheap Printer, Godd Quality but Aweful Cost of Printing","It's actually will be more economic for you to go to your neighborhood photocopy shop than using this printer.
650 rs per cartridge wont even last 100 A4 pages in standard quality.
Inkjets are such a ripoff, man.",2
3205,Not worth it,I printed aound 30 copies and the ink was over. Hp printer app dint work for me to get print outs from my phone. I had to download Nokko printer app on my phone. Not at all satisfied with this product. Please go for a better printer. Don't be decieved by the price. Not worth it.,1
3206,Cartridge gets over very quickly.,"Brought the printer, good quality printing.
Colour cartridge didn't last for more than 4pages. Really pathetic. I have ordered new cartridge from HP, let me try, if the situation is same, then worst cartridge and never support such printers.",4
3207,Good Printer but cartridge ink level issue,On installation of printer and software. A test page and alignment page printed. Checked estimates ink level in cartridge in the HO software. It showed 2/3rd level in colour and nearly 1/2 level in black. Either cartridges were faulty or with low ink level. Black cartridge printed no more than 50 pages. Most expensive per page printing cost at around Rs 15 per page.,1
3208,Excellent for personal use,Excellent...in low cost...with lots of facilities available...printer..copier....scanner...but limit to A4 size only...which is standard...for scanner or copier. Next refill is easier in inkjet than laser. Overall for personal use its a great device.,4

3210,print cartridge issue,"From day1 we had issue with this printer as one of the print cartridge (color) did not work at all. Despite follow up with the manufacturer, even they were not able to fix the issue. Now after using it for a couple of days for just black and white printing, even that print cartridge also stopped working. Overall very bad experience with this printer and service. Not recommended to buy.",1
3211,.y opinion,It's not value for money after you buy as usual any inkjet ...after you use some day after 2 or 3 refilling you get lots of issues al always ...eventually its cheap but maintenance of the printer not so low,3
3212,Good but cartridges too small,Good product but only issue is that cartridges are too small and hold very less ink even on refilling. Cost of new cartridge is too high. Economy printer should have reasonably priced cartridges.,3
3213,Affordable printer but very high cartridge ink usage,"The print cartridges aren't proper. The ink consumption is very high and per cartridge cost is 720 bucks. Colour cartridge supplied alongwith the printer doesn't work. I need to now go to HP service center to get a resolution to a newly bought printer.

Dissatisfied as a customer.",1
3214,Product Received with Cartridge Package Open,I received my printer today. The Cartridges package was open. I am not able to take color print. Black Ink Printer was of poor quality. Awaiting response from Amazon or Seller on replacement or refund.,1

Also my product is under warranty but still I am not getting any support on this item. It is not printing any document. Is it possible to exchange the items ? Worst item received from Amazon . No quality check and after sales services .",1
3216,Un-Economical cheap printer,"I like everything in this printer but the real reason is about disliking this product is not imtge printer but it's cartage system it's very much costly you could even buy a new printer if you wish to buy two three sets of new cartage don't buy this printer if you wish to print economically don't take this printer even you if you want to print 1 or 2 prints because that will even cost you more than 10 or 11 rupees per print so don't buy by another type of printer which do not use cartridge system if you want to print economically

mail from amazon) which they have not initiated till now.",1
3219,Worst Printer Ever,"One of the worst printer to date that I’ve used. It’s just a nightmare to print using this. Even if printing 2 pages is like a task. Pages are getting waste and the biggest mistake that I did was I did not process it for return. Now I have to either throw it or give it someone at whatever they pay for, I would definitely not recommend this product to any one.",1
3220,Nice printer,"Very nice printer must buy it.u should only use this printer to print important documents ink will stay longer

No cd included in box have to download software from HP store",5
3221,Ok ok printer for the price range,"The delivery from amazon was awesome. The hardware installation instructions are little bit difficult to follow.
The software installation was taking more than an hour and had difficult time in making the printer work in linux environment as often print queue crashes. Even in windows sometimes I face the issue. The print speed is very slow, may be you can print 3 pages in a minute. But it is value for the money though. Over all I am satisfied.",4
3222,Disappointed,It does not print black. I tried all online resources but failed. Don't know what is wrong. Color ink is ok. Black is full but not giving output.,1
3223,Bad delivery experience,"Product is ok. But the delivery executive took rs 26 extra as he had no change. He assured he will add it to my Amazon pay account, but he didn't. Very bad behaviour. You lose the trust of your customers this way.",4
3224,Dissatisfied,"It's jst 4 months that we buyed the product and it is not working.... It was fine till we were using the 1st cartage but after replacing it with a new one it stopped working...
It would be bst if you buy a gud printer spending some 8000 coz it would prove to be useful in long run and the cartage would be less expensive also.. the cartage with this printer is very expensive costing some 1500 for both colour and black&white and 1 cartage hardly print 100-150 pages so we have to change it time to time and it would dry up if we are not using it regularly so total waste of money. It is just wise to buy some gud printer with less price for cartage.☺️",1

3230,"Not economical, will turn out to be expensive if you prink a lot","If anyone wishes to buy this, please note that the cartridges are too expensive and you'll only print around 100 pages from each one of them. Go for the more economical versions of HP printers, whose cartridges are cheaper than this.",3
3231,It's ok. But can be better.,Some times the printer dint work. While some times it misprinted. But i would say it's ok. The most disappointing thing is ink which is very expensive. U can go for it but i will suggest look for some other brands. Small review after months of use. Not good for intense use.,3

THANK YOU",4
3234,OK for light Home useage,I just bought the cheapest printer I could find for myself and turns out to be a good and worthy printer.. just that I found inserting a single sheet of paper is not very easy and seems like it has to be forced in.. but inserting more than 2 is easy and fits well.,5
3235,Decent printer,Easy to use watched a youtube video for installation. Tried to take a photo print quality could be better. Can xerox.documents without a computer. Had to install driver online for scanning. Printer configures easily. If you can afford makes a bit of sense to spemd. 2k more for a wifi printer. All in all for 3k a home printer which can scan/Xerox is a good deal,4
3236,Excellent for photo print.,"Print quality is excellent, more than expected, but catridge is not sufficient copis print. hardly can print only 5 to 6 colour A4 copies, also hp803 cartridge is expensive and cannot easily available.",4

3239,Don't buy it!,"The black cartridge had worn out soon. Other cheap inks are not much of a use. If not used daily, concussion will form in the cartridge. Much bigger job. Atlast you'll be using this printer only for scanning. You can buy a cheap scanner for it. Why buy this waste package of expensive commodity which will pressure you to buy more and more HP cartridges and Ink again and again?",1
3240,Not as expected from the hp brand.,"I have purchased it about 6 months ago mainly for scanning, but not satisfied with scanner quality. Its scans blue ink signature as black and violet color stamp also not as violet as actual is, in other words its scan does not give true colors. Also, its printing consumes more color inks, which resulted in expensive printing costs.",2

If we insert a new cartridge cost around Rs. 800/-, just 100 Nos of A4 size paper can be printed. Moreover refilled cartridge is not accepting this system. So consider this before buying ink jet printer..",1
3244,Printer worked only for one month and helpline is impossible to get,After installing printer in October 2019 it worked only for one month with 802 black cartridge. Once it got finished bought HP 803 cartridge which was recommended by HP. It did not work. Followed HP instructions to sort out matter. Did not work. Then bought HP 802 cartridge because it had come with original printer. That too did not work. Since last 45 days attempted up teen times to contact helpline no. 18002000047. You just do not get it. Orange light continuously blinks. Have no idea what to do.,1
3245,Good for home use with small number of printing requirements,"Its a good product. Smooth printing + scanning. However, I am not sure how to connect mobile phone to it. But at this price its more than fine as I do not have much printing requirements just one or two in a month so its the best and most affordable product which suits such requirement.

Thank you Amazon !!",5

3261,Scanning,It is supposed to be all in one. But scanning is a problem with this machine.,4
3262,Essential for home office and pocket friendly,"As I am working from home from last many months due to lockdown this product is something in essentials. The printer , scanner or photocopy we are using for many essential tasks.

This product is not much expensive or pocket friendly.",5
3263,Think twice...product price is low..but cartridges will loot u.,"Can use it as a showcase peice.
Prints only 10-20 colour pages and prints approximately 20 b&w papers.Then u r done with printing.
If u want to purchase new catridge it would cost around 2000.
You can purchase new printer again and use it as a showcase peice.",1

3265,EXCELLENT.,Very nice. The last two papers were printed by the printer. Black and colour ink is included with it. Go to 123.hp.com and start it setup for easy setup. The printer has many functions. And the printer is perfect and has no issues. Excellent product,5
3266,Good for home use,It's a good printer for the price only drawback is the paper feeder is on top paper doesn't remain stiff and gets folded so a bit disappointed with that,3
3267,Good but not best,Good but it ink consumption is very high and it is better to say print is cheaper than ink also its scanner quality is not so good if u r buying for scanner purpose than buy 5500 hp printer i am using it too,4
3268,Received product in a used condition,"Didn’t like the packaging and the product seems like used one.

Delivered cartridges/ refill delivered are used one (Empty)",1
3269,Disappointment,"I don't recommend. My personal experience, it will cost you more than taking print out in some browsing centre. Because only high end printers gives more printout for single caridge full. This machine, if you replace carridges / fill it, for 800 rupees, it can produce 60 to 70...print out.. Which will cost outside 350 rupees..",2
3270,Hp deskjet 2131,"Didn't get the CD to install, so I visited the HP Website and followed the instructions. I don't prefer to buy this again as the cost of cartridge is high.

I suggest do not buy printers or electronic stuff online they give refurbished items.",1
3273,Fraud by printer companies,They sell you these printers super cheap to rope you in. Each cartridge costs 900 now. That's daylight robbery. I should have just gone to my neighbour shop to get stuff printed. If u are a heavy or medium user don't buy this. Scanner is good.,1
3274,Good for the price but the 803 ink finish quickly and it’s expensive,"For this price it’s a good printer, the scanner is a good too, but the problem is the ink don’t walk it runs, that’s the con.

3359,HP printer experience,Bought this in January this year. Within 3 months it started giving trouble. Incomplete printing jobs. Discoloration. N the service agent came to check and said both b&w and color cartridges are dry! In less than 7 months!!!! Horrible purchase.,1
3360,Best for less prints.,Of course very easy to install and use . Pls buy this only if you print around 100 pages per year . If you print more then go for laser jet or any other printer which dont use ink cartridges like this printer which costs you more than the printers MRP.,4
3361,The longetivity of the cartridges will make you cry!,"The pice of a new printer is very low, but the cartridges will make you cry. Two small cartridges both colour & black costs half the printer price and wont even last 30 prints.",2
3362,Nice printer with few major drawbacks.,"Print quality is very nice , however printing time is more as printing is very slow, cartridge ink level is also very less considering the high cost of cartridges. scanning quality is also pretty good.
Overall a decent printer.",3
3363,It is very slow,"It is sooo slow at such level that if you want to print a copy from laptop to printer,in just 1sheet it take aroung 1 min....yeah speed is descent in scanning but in printing from mobile or laptop it is terrible",3
3364,You will not get a cartridge easily.,"Cartridges are more costly compared to printers... Once you buy this printer, then after 150 pages you have to buy a cartridge and the starting price of a cartridge is 1800/-.
From my perspective, you have to buy a printer with an ink tank which is better than this printer.",2
3365,Useless printer,"Use less got problem show error every where on computer on cartridges ,. Totally waste of money.....never buy cartridge printer /instead buy ink tank printers ,,,",1
3366,Replace it,"Since it is not working with my Mack Book can I replace it with HP 2723. I shall pay you difference in cash at the time of delivery and return you full

I request u to refund my product or replace it
Even power button is also not working properly",2
3369,Don't buy,"The printer ink is very expensive. If you do t use it regularly the ink dries up. We have stopped using it altogether. 1700 for the cartridge

3371,Not for Print a lot,It is good for people who do not print a lot bcz of the Per Page price and it is good looking and light weight product,4
3372,Do not go for it,"Cartridge is a small size and very costly.

Do not go for it.

Refill of cartridge is possible at select local. Places but that too girl best just 40 pages.

Size of cartridge is small",1
3373,Value for money,"I like the easy setup and not so complicated functions, black and white print comes out absolutely well but the coloured print is not as it should be over all it’s value for money",5
3374,Okay for the price.,"Okay printer but not very user friendly with pull out paper stacker support, poor visual guide for functions and extremely costly ink cartridges.",3
3375,SAY buy,"No help to install the printer. the CD was missing. We were used to call hardware people to install it and pay for it too.
the cartridge is too small may not last even few printouts.",2
3376,Excellent product!!!,Loved the printer. It is exactly as per the description. Prints really well. Value for money. Easy to assemble. Using it regularly now. Would highly recommend it.,5
3377,Aesthetic appearance and smooth finctioning,"Smooth functioning , light weight , easy to install are the features needed for occasional use at home and satisfied that all three parameters are met with this printer.",5
3378,Overall a good printer with all required functions and good price,"Very easy to use and install

Few cons
- no wifi printing

3379,Waste of money,The ink is finished so soon and catridge very expensive. Never buy printer from HP. They offer the printer with good price and ink cartridges very VERY expensive,1
3380,Poor cartridge quality,"Poor cartridge quality. Does NOT print after 8-10 prints, although the app shows more than 70% ink. Appears that ink dries out in storage of 2-3 months. Not worth buying new cartridge around 1K every time.",1
3381,प्रिंट करने में काफी समस्या आती है और पेपर वेस्ट होते हैं साथ में स्याही भी use होती है,प्रिंट करते वक्त 2-3 पेपर लाइनिंग के साथ ब्लैंक निकलते हैं खाली निकलते हैं और काफी समय लगता है काले रंग की धारियां बनती हैं बार-बार प्रिंट की कमांड देनी पड़ती है,2

The cartridge will get it your head, ruin your day and burn your money.
Worst product I have purchased on Amazon!!! And I am still regretting. Whoever wants my printer can have it.",1
3385,Buy if you want to use just 2-3yrs,"If you want a cheap moderate printer then its ok. Keeping in mind to use for 2 to 3 yrs of moderate usage as catriges cost sky high.
Else go for tank printers if you want high usage at cheaper cost.
Think thoroughly before choosing.
Goodluck.",4
3386,Buy only if you have loads n loads of money n want to drain it somehow,"Its like keeping an elephant as a pet.
Everything is fine, but cartridges will clean your pockets. Not recommended at all.",1

3391,Great for Home/Personal Use,This model is just right for home\personal use. It's printing capabilities is great for documents but not so great for photos. Its scanning capabilities are great all around. The only limitation for scanning is its size. Other than that this printer does what it is designed to do.,5
3392,Need immediate service support from HP for printer.,"The printer is behaving erratically, always missing pages while printing. Moreover, odd & even printing also always missing pages and it is never happening. Can I get service support for this issue from HP? Please help.",1
3393,Don't buy,Don't buy this printer. I ordered printer on july 2020. It was working good till sept 2020. After that it stopped working properly. Very bad experience because ink cartriedge also not available online offline. No service centre available. So i request not to buy this product.,1

3402,New cartridge price too high,The main problem with this prinyer is the cost of cartridge which is very very expensive. Not recommended at all. Very disappointed.,1

The scan quality is very very bad.

Installation CD was missing and it took me a while to find the desired drivers online.

Sorry but I won't recommend this product.",2
3405,Costly cartridge,"The cartridge is too costly to maintain. Once the ink is finished, we can't refill the cartridge with the ink. Even if we try to fill the cartridge with the ink, the pages turn out to be blank or void of the respective color. Hence, the cartridge has to be replaced again, which makes it very costly to maintain.",3
3406,Useless box on table.. Don't Buy..,I generally don't write review but this time have to and it's like the worst experience. Thought it's cost friendly while buying it but once ink finishes it's just useless box on table. I also don't understand why tiny inkbox cost is Rs.1700.,1
3407,Don't do mistake to buy this product,very bad and costly product it could print only 40 pages in one cartridge and new cartridge costs 700 Rs so printing becomes costlier,1

Hope makes a sense",4
3413,Good Quality.,"Print & Scan qualities are good. Very useful until future becomes ""Digital correspondence only - completely paperless"", even then its going to work as good scanner for digital storage.",5
3414,The ink cartridges supplied with the printer lasted only 8 print outs.,"There was no technician attending to my problem even after e-mailing them. Also asked for replacing the cartridges, which till today did not materialize. The printer hardware has 1 year warranty along with software media warranty of 90 days.

3415,Good printer,"Its al in one printer..good quality and al the stuff but ink drains off very fast...it gives only 200 pages max for 2 ink cartridges (blank n white)

Ultimately Amazon name is on stake.",5
3424,HP Deskjet 2131 AiO | Budget Printer,"No Driver CD, No Catridge received with this Printer. Only a link is mentioned and when its clicked, it takes you to download HP Smart Desktop Application from Microsoft Store.
For other drivers, I had to Google ® and download them, which is a cumbersome procedure",4
3425,"For the price, the printer is the best bit the ink is precious jewel",For the printer the cost to use ratio is great. But the ink is its precious jewel.

3426,Great product for personal use,"Great product for personal use. Cost effective and easy to install.

But you need to use the cartridge judiciously.

If you are on a low budget and you only need it for small scale printing and scanning. I would recommend this printer",5

The build quality feels sturdy.
The in hand feel of this flash drive is superb.
I bought it for Rs. 970 for 64GB.

Now coming to the performance.
I didn't faced any major heating issues but yeah it heats up. May be the heat coming out of it is a lot for you but for me its just fine.

It reacts differently with different ports as we all know already.
The best speed which I got is on the 3.1 usb type-C port.
The test results are between different ports but with same pd.
2.0 vs 3.0 vs 3.1 vs 3.1 type C.

NOTE = I'm not sharing photos of the pendrive itself because as I can see its easily visible in the other reviews.

Like this review if it helps you, cos it really motivates me to keep doing this work.

But when it comes and I used it on my phone it didn't get detect in my phone.

The speed could have been better but can't complain much very good for its portability and Normal usage.
I got 58 gb out of 64gb which is weird. hence 3 stars for storage capacity.
The pendrive qas very compact compared to 2017 model of sandisk usb 3.0 pendrives.
And the pendrive doesn't heats up, i transfered 15gb of data no heating issue.",4
4047,Not worth it's not a good product,One of the worst product guys don't waste your money on buying this product it's not a good product genuinely . I brought this pendrive thinking I can easily transfer my memories to this pendrive and free my phone space .. but when I transferred my photos to this pendrive after a day I wanted to see those pics on my TV but it was not able to work in TV 😣. Then later when I used it in Mobile it came but guess what half of my photos were automatically deleted 💔 which was very much important to me. I request Amazon to remove such products . And also request Amazon to kindly refund me the amount so that I can buy some better pendrive . Thanks for your support Amazon . Hop Amazon refunds me back .don't buy this product .,1
4048,Products capacity shown was wrong...,Pendrive capcity shown on features was 64 gb but actual delivered pendrive capacity was only 57.2 gb... How's this possible... Its given information was fake....,1
4049,Total Disappointment,"I bought 2 SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive Go Type C Pendrive for Mobile 64GB, and 128 GB...
From the appearance of the product, It looks like a sturdy device. Don't be carried away by the image, the USB plug in region is a very cheap plastic...weaker than Sandisk Cruiser blade...Very flimsy design. Don't buy Waste of Money.. Regretted to have bought this...Disappointed with Sandisk. A product with a reasonably high price and with good memory storage should be strong enough to use...This is absolute nonsense and waste of money..A big 0 for this product...",1
4050,"Sleek, stylish, but does not show consistent speeds","Like:
1. Comes in varying capacities - 32 - 265 GB
2. Neat, sleek, small, cute design
3. USB C-type end is metal and looks sturdy.
Not so good:
1. Read, write speeds vary.
Read speeds are high - 130 MB/s
Write - for large 4 GB file starts at 60MBPS, falls off to 20 MBPS
For many small files varies between 9 MBPS - 25 MBPS.
2. USB A-Type side is made of plastic and could break.
3. Slightly heats (but not as bad as previous version)",4
4051,Good device for specially mobile file transfers.,"I just received this pdrive today, and use it for once and it's working great for me. Good product and that multi USB and USB-C type ports are just so helpfull to send and receive files from within the device. That new 3.1( or3) USB version is a go too in present as it will work flawless on your hardware.
From my recent use and view it looks solid and i would recommend to everyone who's interested in this product to not at all think twice and go for it. It's one of the best options available right now.",5
4052,Wast of time and money,"Android phone not working
Amazon replacement after limited time not able to done
iOS also not working
Total money waste
Don’t buy this type",1
4053,A size comparison would have been great.,"As Amazon would compare to human size most of the product, if that size comparison was done to this product it would be nice. Because it turned out to be too small to what it is shown, it is just the length of 2 microSD cards, and the build quality is so cheap that after hundred inserts it will start cracking(USB A side).
Supplied app is good to move or copy your files. USB type A side is at 3.1 and USB type C side is a USB 2. You cannot connect to your phone and laptop at the same time, it will give you 30 gb around.",4
4054,"Budget USB and WARENTIED for 5 YEARS ,i got replacement","I bought 128 GB data card with 5 year wRrenty om 22 March 2020,it' malfunctioned i contacted amazon for replacement and proper guidance was given to process warranty ,contacted sandisk .It took long time over phone to process .Now the item returned to authorised agent for replacement.

Thanks Amazon
Thanks three times SanDisk",5
4055,Extensive review... must read before buying !!!,"I formatted the drive as NTFS filesystem. Then tested the write and read speed on two files (both around 8 GB). I tested both USB C and A (it's a blue coloured usb).

Write speed using USB C: I got about 36-40 MBps speed for 1.5 minutes then the speed reduced to 26-30 MBps. The total time taken for the whole file transfer was about 4 minutes.

Write speed using USB A: The write speed was consistent around 16-17 MBps for the entire duration.

Read speed using USB C: About 140-142 MBps for the entire duration.

Read speed using USB A: About 145-150 MBps for the entire duration. Yes, this was higher... checked twice.

Storage: Ideally 64 GB pendrive should give you a 59.6 GB usable space but this one gives 57.2 GB. This is the only negative in my opinion, but this is no fault of seller.",5
4056,Good for Quick Backup over OTG,"Bought this for OnePlus 6 (updated to latest Android 10)
Capacity - 256 GB with pre-installed auto backup software (you can remove that to get that additional 1-2 Gb)
Quality - Plastic (not cheap one, but yes, towards USB A end, its prone to damage and breakage and its very thin).
Speeds - I got 100 mbps transfer rate on USB 3.0 port while copying to USB Portable samsung SSD. While copying bunch of small/os files, its slow.. for larger files, its fast only.
Software - I didnt used the Sandisk Memory Zone software, as it showed me backup up, but there were only folders when checked in PC. So, back to File explorer, and it works. Always Copy and paste (not cut), and backup in PC before deleting from Phone.
Purpose - I used Go-Pro and Nikon Snapbridge to copy files from Cam to Mobile (but still backup in this PD to be safer and clear storage in Mobile.
Deal - Got the 256 GB version in Amazon Sale at only 2200, so its a deal.",5
4057,Loved it 👍👌,"After one month use on c type smartphone I really love it, Pros:-
-> It is so easy to switch between c type smartphone and laptop.
-> Really fast connection within seconds.
-> Total free space given 115GB which is more than enough.
-> Value for money is also excellent.
-> Data Transfer speed is very good.
Cons:-
->Although it lacks cap for covering so u have store it in dustproof place.
->Its become superhot in short interval of time when switched to smartphone..
Well these are minor problem for me, Overall its Wonderfull device in this price range.",4
4058,"If data is important to you, you must use it.","I rec'd my Dual SanDisk yesterday and when I tried it on my Samsung Galaxy M31s, I did not feel any response from the phone. I wanted to return it then and there but then consulted some youtube videos referring to my phone model. I found that people are using OTG feature with this phone.

Ultimately, I decided to download and install Memory Zone app. After this installation, the OTG drive was recognised and started functioning the way it should. This app is already supplied with this drive but the phone was refusing to read the contents of this drive hence the problem.

In this regard, I found Redmi phones much more user-friendly than Samsung.

I had opted for 64GB drive which I got. Once it is installed and working, it is very convenient and useful item. If you have important data (photos and videos etc.) in your phone which you cannot afford to lose, it is highly recommended that you copy your data to this dual drive everyday. I have lots of friends who, when their phone is lost or when the phone is dropped accidentally and the data is irrecoverable, they are more sorry for their lost files than for their phone.

Nothing proves cheaper, easier and more sensible to copy your pics, videos and other important data in this OTG dual drive. It is easy and lightening fast.",5
4059,USB and C-Type Pen Drive,"1 week into purchase, easily helps store/transfer the data from your mobile this pen drive on the go. The memory zone software also helps people who are not comfortable otherwise for very easy 1 click transfers and backup.
Product does get a little heated up, don't know if that's normal. Very effective for data transfer for my S9+.
The C-type and USB port helps you transfer data easily between ur mobile device to laptop/PC.",4

4061,Simply great device to transfer files between cell phone and laptops.,"(NOTE: I have USB 3.0 port on my laptop so can't measure full speed) Simply a great compact device for storage and quick transfers.

1. Doesn't heat much, stays cool for long period of times.
2. Very compact.
3. USB 3.1 gen 1 (However my old laptop had 3.0 port so can't measure full speed) + USB Type C

Default formatting is FAT32 (to support old / long range of devices).
Average file write speed (on 32 GB variant): 22MBPS (on USB 3.0 interface)
Average file read speed (on 32GB variant): 30MBPS (on USB 3.0 interface)
which is not the best but considering it stays cool during transfers, it can be neglected (as it will not going to be wear / soft-broken too early).",5
4062,Admirable Performer but Flimsy Build quality.,The product performs admirably. I had no issues with file transfers and get upto 60-65MB/s sustained copy speeds. The one area where I had to knock points off is the build quality. It's very flimsy and I don't think it can sustain an being bent. So be careful if you plan to carry this as a daily driver.,3
4063,Waste product. Didn't work.waste of money,"Its only use to fill space in wastebin.it didn't work and i missed the return time due to travel time in pandemic.if u insert it it can't show this storage in ur mobile even aftr installing their custom app(sandsik memory zone).Waste of money and waste of time.if there is a option for zero review point,this product will fill that place in all boxes",1
4064,SandDisk - 57 GB Pendrive! FRAUD AT ITS BEST!,"I usually don't do product reviews.
But taking extra effort to do it.
You get 57.2 GB.

As per SanDisk, 1GB =1000MB.
However, it should be 1024MB as per standard.

Even then, there is additional 2.5 GB missing after calculation.

Rebrand the product as 57 or 58 GB Pendrive!

Did not expect such low level of fraud by reputed company.",1
4065,Sandisk ...Always the best,"When it comes to Flash storage devices, look no further than Sandisk. Cute and tiny device that comes with a Sandisk Memory Zone (can be installed from Playstore also) which is good in backing up data from phone and transferring to PC and vice versa.",5
4066,"Don't over think, this is the best you can get for this price, go for it.","Sandisk has delivered what I always wanted. It is compact, it is sleek, it is fast and it simply works.

Transfer speed varies and depends on your device (Don't expect cheap Chinese phones to give you the speed in data transfers) as well as other factors. So far i have no issues.

Size is perfect it is easy to carry and it is sturdy, I am not sure why people are complaining about build. I have been using it regularly - port mechanism simply works and feels like any other drive.

To be honest I did not expect it to be good, but it surprised me. I am very satisfied with the end result.",5

4069,Good product for under ₹800.,"1.) I got 57.2 GB out of 64 Gb as per the calculations of this devices I should get 59 GB. (1gb for manufacturers is 1000mb.)
2.) It is very small and the material used is plastic.
3.) Data Transfer Speed in standard usb port is 14.6 Mb/s.
4.) Looks good but feels delicate and wish they had provided a cover for the A port.
5.) I got it for ₹619/- (including my previous cashback. It was available for ₹728. If you get it under ₹760/- then go for it.

It is very good pendrive, you can surely buy it.
Use large files when transferring to pendrive else you will get less speed.
Tip: use zip file of folders when transferring folder containing very small files.",5

It was just Bubble Wrapped !
I know it was something to notice on but who cares , I checked if it was working or not an I found no issues with that .... So I started using it :-)",4
4072,great otg pen drive,Got this ultra portable USB 3.0 Type C pendrive. The unit is plasticky and the swivel mecahanism looks not so strong. Using it attached to my key chain. Greating for moving items from phone to laptop or vice versa. Go for it.,5

I'm facing an issue where I moved two of my rar files from my android device directly to the pendrive (thumb drive). But when I tried to move another that is 3rd rar file it was moved but after getting moved it was not shown in the folder of the pendrive where I moved it so I attached the pendrive to my laptop and after that it showed that another new folder is been automatically created onto the pendrive and in that newly automatically created folder called 'FOUND00' the missing 3rd rar file was found in broken condition which said as recovered. So again now I ejected the pendrive from laptop and again inserted it back to android device and then I tried to move the file from pendrive to android device but again it didn't work it just stopped the moving process abruptly in 39-40% of moving process.",1
4074,"Nice product, but take the metal body type.","The Good Part:
The storage capacity is great.
The design is cute and can be attached with a key chain ring.

Please go for a Metal Body type for durability.

A type: Took half an hour to transfer the 28.6 GB files from PenDrive to Laptop.

A type: Moderate.",4
4075,Think twice before purchasing it!,"The pendrive is really bad. It gets extremely hot while using it with my ipad pro. And thats not even why i gave it a 1 star. The pendrive came out from its bodycover only after some days of using it.

4079,Compact device which is faster and versatile.,"There is decent storage capacity slightly lower than general around 120 GB.
This pendrive get very hot while in usage. it's very bad thing for a storage device.
It works on different devices perfectly, I have used it now for 2 months.
In terms of Speed, I can say it is fast. You can get good speed on USB 3.0 ports.
I have bought it on sale so I have found it more value for money that time and also with great offers with it.",4
4080,Nice,"Available capacity 30.75 gb. Very compact and light weight. Looks delicate -especially the USB A side port is plastic not metal. Plastic is bit thin in this area.
Was able to just plug in and connect to my moto x4 without installing any other app. Have not tried connecting to computer yet. I am not too keen on data transfer speeds,etc. So, no comments in that area.",5
4081,AWW THATS HOT....THATS HOT,Only 58GB is usable out of the advertised 64 but thats just how these things work. It feels very fragile but is compact and very lightweight. Worked flawlessly with both my usbc phone and laptop with around 30mbps sustained transfer speed. The only problem is how HOT it gets if used continuously for like 30 mins( idling while just plugged in) or when big transfers are made. I dont know if this is normal or something to be concerned about lol.,4
4082,Not supported with PC/Android TV/Smartphone at the same time.,"Plastic built is a major down point. At this price and considering the use (On The Go). Metallic built is necessary.
Please go for other options if you are willing to buy an otg pendrive.

Another down point is you can only use this with pc/android tv/mobile at the same time if you are using FAT32 file system, which restricts you to transfer file of more that 4GB. and if you manage to format this in exFAT then you can only transfer data between mobile and PC, since most of the android TV out there do not support EXFAT.

So the purpose of purchasing a 64 GB pendrive is defeated. As if you wish you to transfer a 10gb video file to pendrive and then play it on android Tv. Sorry to say but u can't.",2
4083,Your item is damn bad quality and its not a dual function pendrive..you cheated on me,It says it's both compatible with both phone and laptop or a a desktop but it's not compatible with with the phone..since i need a pendrive so much coz of having a presentation I dint return it since I am able to use use it either with a desktop or laptop..but as far as they have mentioned in the item details it's totally not ..m very upset paying extra money for this..but Amazon has cheated to many customers like me..m not happy at all with this purchase because of not giving the information properly..i want to return this if possible..coz you hv cheated on me,1
4084,Ok pendrive with tremendous heating issues.,"Pen drive is sleek and good looking. Made up of plastic. So durability will be an issue. Overall a good product with option of a key ring Insertion. Just one issue. Pen drive heats up pretty quickly. It's not that I haven't observed heating issues in my earlier pen drives but this one heats up quite fast and within 3-4 mins of use. Heat is so much that sometimes it becomes too hot even to touch.
Not for prolonged uses.",3

I was getting error, so chatted with support person and got it registered.",5
4090,Never regretted,Bought this on 5 oct 2020. I had a pc with 256 gigs and (obviously) was not enough for me. So I thought to buy another ssd to but thought it would be nice to have something which I can use on all my devices. So now I use this with my phone and my laptop and it is great. Read/Write speed are great. It does get pretty hot in the process. You get 141 mbps in the beginning and when its hot it drops to 70. But still better than others even while its hot. And as for write its kinda slow. You get 35 to 40 max. i preffer to use the C port as it sometimes provides better speeds on my laptop. I use this on a daily basis as I have all my files on it. Completely worth the money. You get 114 Gb on a 128 variant.,4

The speeds vary from 1 to 25 mbps while copying to the drive. It maintains a decent average of 15 mbps while transferring.
The speeds vary on the file and the port and all the systems background applications.
Overall deliver well.
Appario sent this. And I have been buying their products.. So I trust Appario.

Best of all this is manufactured in Malaysia September 2020. So it s a new product.

It works seemless with my oneplus too.

Good storage capacity.
Value for money.

4097,VALUE FOR MONEY.,"I received it today & I have not felt any difficulty in using it till now. The data transferring speed is quite slow, but it's acceptable at this price. Build quality is not that much great, it's okay. sandisk memory zone apk was already in the pendrive you don't have to download it just install it from pendrive. If you want to buy a type c pendrive under 1000 according to me it's one of the best option available in market.

मैंने इसे आज प्राप्त किया और अब तक इसका उपयोग करने में मुझे कोई कठिनाई महसूस नहीं हुई है। डेटा ट्रांसफर करने की गति काफी धीमी है, लेकिन यह इस कीमत पर स्वीकार्य है। बिल्ड क्वालिटी इतनी बढ़िया नहीं है, यह ठीक है। सैंडिस्क मेमोरी ज़ोन एपीके पहले से ही पेनड्राइव में था, आपको इसे डाउनलोड करने की ज़रूरत नहीं है, बस इसे पेनड्राइव से इंस्टॉल करें। यदि आप मेरे अनुसार 1000 के तहत एक प्रकार का pendrive खरीदना चाहते हैं तो यह बाजार में उपलब्ध सर्वोत्तम विकल्पों में से एक है।",4

4105,Its only 57 GB not 64 GB .,"I ordered 64GB of storage but its showing only 57.29GB so I replaced it , I received a new device of same type it is also showing the same 57.29 GB only . The month and year of import was September 2020 for both the devices old one and replaced one.

So I can conclude its storage capacity is only 57.29 GB, its not 64 GB.",2
4106,Worth buying,Gets heated as we transfer files but overall a good product. You get 57 GB storage for 64 GB pendrive and transfer rates for video files is around 18-20 mb/s.small size compact pendrive with good look.,4
4107,Honest review from an iPad user,I mainly bought this pendrive to transfer files between my pc and iPad and I've got to say it works perfectly. I love the minimal design and the large amount of storage options. I myself bought a 64gb as I don't think I'll need any more space than that. Definitely worth the buy,5
4108,Do not purchase for an Apple iPhone,Pen drive is not compatible with Apple iPhone X. The word “mobile” used in the product description is misleading. Amazon does not offer a refund. Amazon offers a replacement. Of what use is a replacement if the product is incompatible with an Apple iPhone X.,1
4109,Utter disappointment,"The description full metal body is a complete false statement. I went for this product for that sole reason. But utter dispointment. Not only that it's only made of plastic, the plastic material it's made of so poor quality I wonder even if this is an geninune product. Not recommended for daily use, which was my primary intention.",2
4110,Defective product - heating up like crazy,"The product being sold with huge discounts probably because of design defect.
When ever writing or scanning the drive heats up like crazy, most probably a design defect, cannot return as I have stored personal data and do not want any one to recover this after I return.
Expecting the drive to fail in the short term due to the heating.

I will zero rating for amazon selling such a poor product",1
4111,Multiple problems,"1. Heats a lot, even after 10 minutes of use
2. Storage bought was 64GB but after formatting once, showed disc size as 31.73GB, rest got unallocated. Contacted SanDisk but got a 1-time solution. Had to technically interfere with USB to get it fixed.
3. Cheap Quality Plastic build so USB A side may break soon.",2
4112,"Ok, best in available options.","Slightly overpriced and while the make is good, its not great because the rotating cover does not click on the place. Writting spead is not that great. I did not check it further. It gets hot, but that's notmal I think.",4
4113,SanDisk is the best in this business.,"Better than a sd card. Liked the idea of using it for your phone as well as computer. Good transfer speed and doesn't get hot when connected to the phone like the strontium ones.
Well SanDisk have come a long way in this product and it seems like nothing can go wrong for them good product, excellent design.",5
4114,Your PC or Laptop will Start Getting Hanged after attaching it,"After Attaching it with my Laptop, my Laptop start getting hanged every time, and this is happening from the very first Day. Don't know why this is happening. I tried other pen drives too, but they are working absolutely fine. So the conclusion is that there is a problem in Product itself not in my Laptop.",1
4115,114 g not 128 gb,"Just received the pendrive. Looks good (small & compact) but after plugging into my laptop is showing 114 gb and not 128 gb. I think the manufacturer needs to explain it
1st Edit:- The pendrive heats up after transferring some data. Am also getting slow speeds of 15 to 20 mbps for some files and around 40 for others",1
4116,I wanna metal body pendrive,"Totally worst Because it's made up of plastic body not a metal so
I wants a metal body pendrive
I thought this pendrive is made up of fully metal body
In Amazon images it totally looks like metal body but it's not metal body 🤣😣
That's why I'm not happy with this product.",2
4117,Broken Product Delivered,"Received Damaged Pendrive. packaging of pen drive was damaged and one of these pen drive body is also damaged and is not even working from C Type port and from USB Side it is pressed and its shape is changed that it does not fit in USB port. on the day the product was delivered I went out for long holiday. now I am not seeing and return option, can someone help. images are attached for your reference.",1
4118,Not a great build quality but does the job well,"I have used other SanDisk USB drives in past but with this one I felt the build quality could be better for ₹899.
I will say that this is not a very great design and the usb C connector is not a very great fit, although it fits tightly and there is not any connection loss, it just lacks the great clicky feeling.
I have transferred an 1GB file from my laptop and it gave me around 18-20mbps in usb 2 and usb 3 both. Then I transferred the file to my phone and it gave around 25-28mbps.

You will get 58 GB out of 64GB.
Also this thing heats up a bit just after connecting it to pc",3
4119,114.6 Internal capacity,Internal capacity it only 114.6gb I'm brought 2 times and replaced 4 times. Im not have good experience with this pendrive.,3
4120,Product is good but too low quality plastic body.,"Product performance -read write speed: are mentioned. (good)
Low quality plastic body. USB-A side get bends inward with a thumb press.
Pen-drive gets heat-up very fast & feel the cheap plastic body may melt down.
getting higher read speed on USB-c thunderbolt port.
Available memory capacity shows only 114GB for a 128GB drive, which below par.",3
4121,Must Have,"A must have for transferring photos, documents, Videos from your Phone. Comes with a Memory Zone Android app which makes it easier for data Transfer. Overheats when transferring large amount of files. Data Transfer rate is around 130-150 MB. Built quality could have been better though.",4
4122,Overheats. Doesn’t work as expected with Android,"As soon as I plug it to my laptop it overheats so much it feels it burns your fingers if you touch it. On top of that it didn’t work as expected with an Android phone. Sometimes you can’t play videos or view photos stored in it, or sometimes it tells you you need WiFi connection, even though you are already connected. Very disappointing and I can’t return this anymore.",1
4123,very bad build quality,"The pendrive is good...works well...delivers reasonable speeds...
But the build quality has made me very upset...it is totally plastic (except the pin) so feels very cheap honestly..
Go for the full metal body version...i have that too and its way better in build in build quality than this one...
I give 3 stars and not 5 only because of the cheap feel .
Sandisk shouldn't even be producing such products acc. to me...

P.S- In the pic the silver is the full metal one and black one is this one..",3
4124,Heating like hell,"SanDisk is a Good Brand, But unfortunately I have received a Pendrive that heats Like a Hell in five minutes. Packaging and Price was good... Thanks to Amazon for that. But Pendrive is a small heater.",3
4125,Dual Drive heats up after 1GB of writing,"During my initial testing, I noticed the flash drive heats up like crazy. Until it reaches threshold temperature, write speed remains at roughly 36MB/s, after threshold it limits to 20MB/s.
Otherwise reading speed is crazy fast for a USB drive at 128 MB/s.",2
4126,Hangs everytime,"whenever I use it after transferring 10-20 photos an unknown error pops up and stops the transfer process,it happens repeatedly and its difficult transferring large amounts of photos/data",1
4127,Cheap quality,"Its a plastic body, feel very cheap. Have to keep very carefully, otherwise any medium press cam break it. Very soft plastic. And also finish is not smoth. May be its not original, a copy product. Made it Malaysia.",2
4128,Overall it's good one.,"It is two in one pendrive. It means you can use it on laptop, pc and also on smart phone which has type c charger. It is good pendrive for those don't have laptop and want to send photos and videos to your mobile or from mobile to pendrive. On this pendrive written it give transfer speed 150mb/s but actually it gives speed between 20-35mb/s. Overall it's good pendrive those who want to buy it & especially for those who use type c charger smart phone.",4
4129,Does the job but the plastic cover broke within 2 months,"The performance is fast enough. It works both in Windows 10 and Mac OS. Also it is OTG compatible and I have used it on Honor 10 and Moto G9 mobiles.
Only issue is the poor plastic cover, better to go with metallic body.",3
4130,Unnecessarily complicated -BAD,"It needs its own proprietary app to run wch was bad enough but after i plugged it in my mobile mx player cant see the videos i moved in the pendrive,you cant move data from sd card in your mobile it, i tried it multiple times every time it showed that it failed to move data from sd card within my mobile.",1
4131,Delivery of non compatable item.,The item is not for mobile use. It is not compatible for mobile.pl refund the money as you are unable to replacement.,1
4132,Satisfied.,"Working both on PC and Mobile( USB C type).Data transfer is very good.Only prob is,My Sony Bravia is not detecting the pendrive of i connect it after removing from my mobile.if i format it on pc and take movie/data from pc,it works smoothly on tv.Rest is fine.",5
4133,Device gets heated quickly,"The product is very small and does the job. But it gets heated very quickly. Also product is of plastic build which is durable.
For sequential read the speed is up to 148 Mbps
For sequential write speed is up to 28-47 Mbps

When the device is hot the speed decreases.",4
4134,Does not Support on OnePlus 6 mobiles,"This pendrive doesnot support on OnePlus 6 mobiles.
Please check all list before buying",1
4135,NOT AS EXPECTED,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 # Speed: Maximum Write Speed is only 35 mbps and sometime slower than that. Read speed start with 140mbps and suddenly decrease downto 40mbps.

#Quality: It heat up a lot. temperature goes upto 40° .
# Type C for mobile : In mobile it is very slow. slow like turtle. it gives only 3-4 mbps write speed and around 15 mbps read speed",3
4136,It is not fully metalic only c tip is metalic and usb part is made up of plastic.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 It is not fully metalic body as they claim. only c tip is metalic and usb tip is made up of cheep plastic. I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. SanDisk please don't cheet people. Amazon should not entertain this bad practices. Amazon should add product discription more specific than general.",1
4137,Disappointed...(Will update review if I get replacement),"I don't know if I got a defective model or not,
But the speeds I'm getting is mediocre at best.
I use an usb 3.0 port and also tried with type C port but the speeds are bad, the maximum I have gotten is 35MB/s, I also formated it to NTFS.
There is no option for refund and my window for replacement closed due to the fact that I got this last week and could only get around to use it today.

Please arrange a replacement for this product.",3
4138,Worst product ever,Worst product..very slow. Not compatible with my phone.. worst service from Amazon.. still didn't get my refund... I tried to transfer 10 GB file. It shows file is too big..,1
4139,I love the Dual Input,"USB C and regular USB are the highlight about this. It works seamlessly with my MBP 2020 and also with other computers.

I no longer need an extra cable to plug in the pen drive.",5
4140,Overall good packadge......,"Overall this otg pendrive is supercool..... And it does not heat much....... And perfectly fit in ports........
And i got 57.3gb free space out of 64gb
Only thing i dont like about this pendrive is its build quality....... It is a bit poor......... Althougu it is not a major issue......
And another compaint is that it does not give much of a soeed that they promise....... I got 30MBps during transfering........ May be it is because of my phone cause it has ufs 2.1 storage....... And yaa i m using redmi note 7 pro and it perecftly works fine.......
Overall i am setisfied with this product......
And yaa it is made in malasiya........",3
4141,Impressive...🙄,"it is not good for me as i have used this pen drive on my phone but the speed is not good so i will confirm the performance is not good as i have sent my 3 to 4gb file and the speed is very bad (25 mins more than).

🙄",4
4142,Go FOR IT👌,"Deliverd on time even in this pandemic situation... Thanks to Amazon
..
Product is really nice... File transfer is fast.. A Sandisk file manager app is present in the USB space... No need to install it... File transfer can be done with existing mobile app... Product is small and handy.. Using Keychain with pendrive is suggested if there is fear of losing it.. Thank u amazon.!",5
4143,Works on realme X2 ..,"The data doped transfer was amazingly fast than other pen drives true to nature 3.0.
However, the installation part was confusing.
In realme x2 , you have to search OTG in settings and enable it..
Only then it works.
Also download SANDISK MEMORY ZONE App from Playstore...
You have to install and search for it.that's all..
Perfect Value for Money",5
4144,"Good build, decent speed, but most importantly, very handy","What I liked the most about it is its style. It feels extremely handy and cool.
Now to its performance: good transfer speed, fairly good storage, will not break unless you try to be JerryRigEverything from Youtube (I did not drop it yet so can't really tell whether it would get damaged or not).",5
4145,Good and Valie for money.,I very much liked this product. Compact and value for the money. Even they have a app to backup and to do other stuffs. I bought this for Rs.680. Don't spend more than this. Dual options works fine. Go for trusted and certified product even if you spend a bit more.,5
4146,Big boom in a small packet,"Does the job pretty well, I had to format it with FAT32 file system to make compatible with Android Tv and that's all. A metal casing would have been made it more durable, let's see how it goes on in long run.",5
4147,"Good for keeping backups, but not day to day use","The pendrive works great. But it tends to get uncomfortably hot when you write or read stuff from it.
This is not an issue cause it'll not make the drives speed worse or harm the drive itself, but if you want to use the drive as a storage drive to which you can install apps or store stuff so you can plug and play, it could be a source of concern. All in all, it's an okie dokie drive with great speed and versatility.",4
4148,"Little,cute, speedy & modern looking pendrive","Nice and little cute looking pendrive unlike the classical one,but you get the storage about 114 gb out of 128 gb.... received in nice packaging,the writing speed is quite good.go for it, good to buy i bought it at 1699.",4
4149,Bad quality plastic,"Storage capacity is around 34 GP less, which is reserved for system files, very flimsy to use the product, didn't expect such a low quality build from scandisk, low quality plastic, too costly for this low quality make. Disappointed",2
4150,Good speed with poor body.,"Out of 128GB you get 113GB, thats not an issue. Frankly its very delicate, I feel like I might break it someday while inserting it to pc or phone... Build could have been better as this hard plastic doesn't seem much strong. Transfer speeds are adequate I recieved speed around 250mbps and its good.",4
4151,Great speeds upto 20MBPS during copying(+has type c port),This USB drive is great value for money offering 64 GB storage with USB 3.0 support and type c port providing compatibility with new phones with type c with out the need for a dongle. The write speeds are quite good with up to 20 MBPS and read speeds are also good although I did not test it fully. All in all its a good for anyone who need a new 64 GB thumb drive.,5
4152,Good but not great..,"Ergonomics 5/5, Design 4/5, Compatibility 5/5, Build quality 3/5 which is basically plastic with only the type C port being steel/metal, Speed 2/5. The speed is unacceptably slow for a usb 3.1 drive around 30-40MB/S which is really the main gripe I have with this. Overall a 3.5/5 Experience",3
4153,"Superb speed, gets little hot.","I have been using it to connect with Mi TV.

It works as described, speed is perfect while copying. Works superb on my phone and TV both.

Only issue is it gets hot while performing all the tasks which you can ignore as well.",4
4154,Highly recommended,"First thing I noticed was how compact is the size of this product. By far, this is the best designed pendrive of Sandisk that I have used.

Used with type C port of my laptop, and writing speeds went as high as 130mbps, while staying at 120mbps most of the time.

Really useful product for transferring files from phone to laptop.",5
4155,The One to Go With ease!!,"1. Transfer Speed is 150+
2. Extremely smaller in size.
3. Feels delicate & weighs less.
4. True storage capacity 249 GB,
5. Heats up & cools down quickly",5
4156,Heats up after small amount of usage,"Received the pendrive as per expected schedule. But as soon as the pendrive was inserted in mobile using usb c port, pendrive started to heat up, even without carrying out any operations in it.",3
4157,Stay Away!,"You get only 52GBs
The black mat finish is on plastic, outer body is made of plastic.

Outer moving part is also not great to use, as it is also made of cheap plastic.

I would suggest to stay away from this product.",1
4158,Sandesk pendrive 64GB doesn't work properly.,"This pendrive does not work properly. No files are transferred from one folder to another.
When you put this pen drive in your Android phone.And whenever you are going to copy paste any file in your mobile to this pen drive, it tells the error.",1
4159,Compact and fast,It is a really good and handy pendrive. Some people are complaining about the speed but they don't know that your cpu or laptop should also support usb 3.0 for the pendrive to work at its full speed. I used it on a very old laptop and it was giving 20mbps but when used on a new one which supports usb 3 it gave a speed upto 140-150mbps.My only complaint is that it gets a little warm while using.,4
4160,Heats up even for data reading,"While it is quite compact in size, look and feel of the product is not worth 5 stars. Today, connected to laptop to read a video file of about 300mb in size and 1 min duration. The pen drive heated up substantially within a minute. Writing speed is decent, and again, the same issue of heating quickly. I dont know how long this would last.",4
4161,Ok product,3 star only because plastic body and claims 128gb pendrive but its available space only 114 gb.transfer speed also not that much what sand disk claiming bit slower side 100mbps only,3
4162,Best Product,"Best product under this price range.
Out of 64gb it gives 57gb storage.
Transfer speed is very fast.
Smooth comparability with both PC & mobile.
Product material quality is good.
Value for money.",5
4163,Is a nice drive.,"Size is optimum. If it would have been any smaller, it would be a trouble keeping it in sight. I actually had to buy this one because I lost my earlier one, which was small as heck. Read speed 139.2MB/s and Write speed 59.8MB/s.",5
4164,Unhappy !,"The only thing i was sceptical before buying was the storage ......the pendrive is captioned with 64 GB of storage , but when you use it , it offers you only 57GB , and I think 7 GB is a big storage space that cannot be compromised, specially with brands like this . Quite unhappy !!",5
4165,Buy and Regret - buy if u want to cook on it .,"Worst pen drive as it gets heated like fire (within 1 min after connection) and plastic quality is too bad. This device will not be compatible to car audio system as well . Overall not worthy to spend a penny on this . If we buy we will be left with 64GB of regret but not useful storage . But u can use this device for cooking which is of no electricity,no gas . Just connect and cook",1
4166,"Its portable, cheap, good quality","I think it does the job as you expect it to be. The file transfer isnt crazy fast but what else could you expect from such tiny size device. Overall, not too bad.",4
4167,Not same as I thought.,"I wanted to connect it with my mobile but it doesn't get inside only.
And the computer port is made of plastic not metal I thought that it is made of metal but it was plastic! My thinking was totally lose. But storage capacity is good.",1
4168,Waste of money and of the worst quality everrrr,Such a waste of money I tell you......it cant withhold videos in it if you cut and paste it.....and the video somewhere vanishes and now it's not in the pen drive and as well in your phone.such a waste material.....🤯😡,1
4169,Excellent product - very convenient and easy to use,This is just the perfect backup for modern mobiles with a Type C USB port. Can easily backup mobile data into the drive and port it to the laptop/other storage media through the laptop. Very convenient.,5
4170,Not the product you want (Worst Product),"The read and write speed is much slower then mentioned in the product descriptions.
The usable storage is 57.2 GB only.
The product is in 5 years warranty, however, you will not get the warranty card with the product.
You can't return this product, they will replace it but not take it back from you in return as they are not willing to pay you back.",1
4171,Very good got an app also,It is easy to carrying and good in quality also you don't feel got a cheap product also value for money i can say buy this without doubt but i feel speed of data transfer is little bit slow bcz same folder i moved in me phone form memory card to phone take around 1 min to complete transfer but same folder move from memory card to pendrive it take around 2 3 min,5
4172,Good product but confirm before ordered,It's only use for new models Mobile. Please before ordered confirmed that Mobile sockit is type of C or not. I was not confirmed before ordered hence it is useless for my Mobile,3

Write speed on poco m2= 16-17mb/sec.

It just gets warm sometimes on heavy file transfers. Rest the speeds given by both type c port and type A port are good.

4181,Not value for money,"After 20 days, its get broken and really bad quality , price is really higher than the plastic used. Please lower the price or make it with some kind of metal.

4200,USB Type A 36/16 Mb/S & Type C 134/33 Mb/S value for money,First time I thought its very slow but when switched to Type C it gave good speed. It has some max write size limit. I got many times disk full error even when there was plenty of space. Good considering money but for excellent experience look for other.,4
4201,Don't go with it,Not working properly. Transfer speeds are not constant even it is usb 3.1 And Type c port is too tight and build quality is average.,1
4202,Awesome,"It's compatible for both phone (which has C type pin) and laptop. Thing is we have to install SanDisk app in our phone which is not an issue when we are downloading all unnecessary apps lol🤣. IDK y people are bringing up so many apps, every app seems important 🤷",5
4203,Best for the price,"Pros: really compact, low price compared to competion, companion app well made, good transfer speeds
Con:heats up a bit",4
4204,San disk ultra dual drive I purchased in August 20.,"It is a very compact, small and easy to handle drive with quite fast write speed. I could clear 3 GB of my phone memory with in seconds. Just remember that it is C type, so works only with apple iphone and few other android models having type C connector. This should be mentioned in product description but is not mentioned any where.",5
4205,To anyone who's having 2nd thoughts about this due to it's price,"This is the best and true 3.0 pendrive in this price range. I have used Sandisk 3.0 pendrives like Ultra, otg etc but none of them gave me good speed. You won't regret paying extra money for this one. Type C speed is a bit slower but type A speed is pretty good.",5
4206,Nice deal.,At first I thought of returning it by seeing its low transferring speed and the fact that it gets hot quickly but also cools down fast. But then i thought not everything is perfect. Overall it is a nice deal with a fair price. But then I couldn't argue or ask for more with such price.,5
4207,"Not compatible with Samsung C9 Pro or maybe any Samsung phone with type ""C"" charging port","It takes a lot of connection errors just connect with my Samsung C9 Pro, I consistently eject it and plug in so that it just can be detected on my phone for once out of all those attempts.
SanDisk, kindly improve your products. Make them more user friendly, they work fine with PC, but i bought it specifically for my mobile phone. Need something which can work well with my phone Samsung C9 Pro.",2

4209,Looks good and works good.,"Sleek, snappy and really compact. This drive is the one you must have while on the go. Reversible USB C to USB A connectors offer seamless data transfer capabilities across compatible phones. I use it for my daily media and data transfer needs.",5
4210,Best for the price...,Be aware it's made of plastic and not sure how long the thin sheets of usb male plug lasts. Otherwise it's quite easy to use and fast with R/W rates.,4
4211,Value for money,"Product as described in the description!!! Transfer speeds are close enough to the amount mentioned. Love the design as it is small and does not take up tooo much space near the port.
Laptop being used on: MacBook Pro 13"" 2019 edition",5

4215,slow speed and Heating issue,Its a good product but still slow then the usual usb 3 drive i dont know y also it heats up really quick but good for transferring only u cannot depend to work on it for long,3
4216,Reasonably fast,Having both USB-A and USB-C on this flash drive makes it easier to plug into macbooks that have only type-C ports and desktops that often have only type-A ports.,5

4241,100% Satisfied With This OTG Pendrive.,Although my mobile phone's charger pin is not type C but i don't return this pendrive. When I ordered the pen drive I didn't know it's OTG Type C. When I got the pen drive I thought I would return it. But when I used it I fell in love with it seeing its data transfer speed.,5
4242,USE IT CAREFULLY NOT DURABLE BECAUSE OF PLASTIC MATERIAL,It's made up of plastic,3

4247,Best Combo Pendrive,"Best pendrive with combo of USB Type-A and Type-C. This is overall good on performance. But the entire body is plastic. It could be even more better, if the body in metal and swivel in plastic. Anyway SanDisk is a good brand of Western Digital.",5
4248,Speed,"The speed is great when you transfer files from pendrive to your Pc via USB 1 port. But the speed of the type C end is bit slow comparing what I used to use. At this price range, it a a good product indeed.",3

4255,Device heats up a lot!,"This small device works well BUT heats up a lot! The minute there is multiple data transfers, close to 8-10GB, heats up a lot and ceases to work sometimes. I hope it does not damage my system.
I returned one and got a replacement. Moving data to the new one now. And this too heats up!",3

4263,Just go for it if without any doubt its in your budget and need,It is really compact/small and came in a case just like its in the image (with guard at an angle). That is really quality+performance at its price range.,5

4267,Small Size and Great capacity with speed,"This OTG + USB drive with 256GB space is a fantastic product.
What I like about is the capacity and the size. It also has a hole punch for a lanyard or key ring so as to not lose it. The build quality is also good. It is plastic.",5
4268,Perfect,"The built quality is really good and gets very convenient for transferring data from mobile, laptop and MacBook.",5
4269,It's for the mid budget people.,"Just look at the read speed and write speed of the Flash Storage. It will amaze you !!!

4270,Attention Scam!!!,"Stopped working after few weeks. I believed in SanDisk for quality product. I have sent a mail to customer service, It shows your mail inbox is full.

Not really sure about other brands as this is my first usb 3.0 pen drive.
Price is a bit higher. Got it for 970/- for 64GB",3
4282,Worth the money. Highly recommended.,Read and write speeds are decent. Gives around 150Mbps for writing and 200Mbps for reading but it highly depends on the specs of your pc. Also experienced minor heating issues on prolonged usage. Works nicely with both Android and Windows devices.,4

What the cheating this is.. about 4 Gb memory lost..very disappointed.from SanDisk.",3
4310,Recommended. But add few bucks and go for the metal one.,"Speed is decent. 60mbps average
Build quality is better of the metal one.
Got washed in the washing machine twice!

Will give you clear idea after using for a month.",3
4314,Best Performance I've ever seen (If you see under 1000 budget),"Well the performance is pretty good but it heats very fast, if you are ok with the heating then it is the best in the market under 1000rs tag price. The Flash Drive itself is very small as compared to the photo uploaded by amazon.
Overall 4.5/5 (-0.5 for getting heated bery fast after 5mins use)",5
4315,Its value for money,I like its design as it can be used for both port USB C and B. You can use it with the mobile phone as now a days al mobile phones contain the USB C port for charging.,4
4316,Working as expected,"The pendrive works good, but don't know why while transferring movies from phone to pendrive the speed is like 2MBps and around only. Rest everything is smooth and good.",4

i got around 30 MBPS.

4324,ok,"an OK product work well with my phone and laptop, transferring speed is good",4
4325,Does not work in Smart TV's.,SmartTV do not support this pendrive as it does not has Fat32 file system. It has only exFat and NtFS file system.,1
4326,Speed not fast,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Design is so good nd easy to use also but 1 drawback is that it is not so fast transfer recieve spped 16 or 10 mbps otherwise its good",4
4327,Not good,"Pendrive is very poor , because when I connect it to system or mobile it shows format it , I formatted more times again same problem repeating",2
4328,very bad build quality,"this thing will fail in 1 year. the build is plastic and the USB port is very delicate. Only type C port portion is Metal. If you keep this thing in the wallet or with a keyring, it won't sustain. Disappointed to see such a flimsy design choice.",3
4329,Small size makes it easy to carry.,"The best thing is...it's versatility!
Things made easy you can easily sync data between mobile phone and laptop/PC..",5

5056,Superb with my HERO7 Black,"I bought it the next day I got my GoPro Hero7 Black. I was looking at the reviews where some the people have claimed a fake delivery. I got mine 100% Authentic. I tested it on the tools and it indeed is a 119 GB storage card with an avg read/write speed of 80MBPS. It will be more depending upon the device you’re using it with.
The performance with my GoPro is fabulous, no glitches, no frame drops, no dead footage. Absolute made for each other combo.

Also, for anyone having a doubt, it will record 4H of 4K60 footage from the GoPro HERO7 Black.",5
5057,FAKE product,"I returned the previous order because it was fake. And I ordered again and guess what happened this time. I got another fake card. Sandisk always put a memory card and a adapter side by side in separate housing inside the original packing. As you can see the white label shows package contains card-1N, and adapter - 1N, but there is no adapter to be found. And last order was containing fake adapter and card is returned. And this time they send another fake product.",1

After taking so many photos and videos of beautiful places all the videos and photos were corrupted .Fortunetly , my friend had a DSLR and could take few photos from him. First trip in life with new wife and all the memories gone for toss for this expensive stupid memory card",1
5061,"Good Product,Recommends for action cams.","Its worth for the money anyways, performs good with high speed. I bought it for my gopro hero 7, its so good for action cams.",4
5062,Perfect performance to cost option for pro cameras,"Good enough for writing raw files with high end cameras. - I can vouch for up to 24-30 mpx files. Even bursts/brackets of 3-4 exposures is fine. If you are shooting sony A7r series or medium format, and use lot of burst shooting/bracketing, then I am not sure if it'll keep up.
On my Fuji XT2 - wih 24 mpx raw files it mostly works quite well. When I try to do focus bracketing (7-8 shots) it can take a little time to save. You might miss some shooting opportunities in such cases, but it is rare, as you will typically be using focus bracketing and such techniques only for situations such as landscapes which call for more deliberate and slow approach. Still, if this is important, go for UHS-II.
For most people though, this is a great cost to performance ratio. After this, the price increases quite sharply. Also note currently (as of Nov 2019) this extreme series 128 GB card has been updated more recently than the extreme pro counterpart, and is actually slightly faster (strange but true). Once the extreme pro line is updated, it will obviously be even faster. Please read online reviews before buying if this review is dated by then.
Also, go for the 128 gb instead of the 64 gb because the 64Gb has a slower write speed. the increase in price is worth it both for the extra storage and the extra speed.",4
5063,Perfect storage expansion for 128gb Surface Pro 6,"Class 10 SDHC card would give me 12 MB/s transfer speed when copying to card from SSD and 80 MB/s when copying to SSD from card. (₹4000)

This one UHS A2 gives me 80 MB/s on both - copying to card from SSD and copying from card to SSD. (₹7000)

For my use case, the extra speed was worth the price - It’s like my device has a new hard disk now. You can get the same performance for ₹3000 approx with USB 3.0 external HDD. That’s what I told myself when I bought my Surface Pro but in my experience, the portable HDD is really inconvenient. It’s a big thing to carry around and you have to plug it in every time.

Things to keep in mind:
1. Don’t store sensitive data on it - anyone can physically steal the card from your device. And encrypting the card with a password will slow things down which defeats my purpose.

2. Format to NTFS before using - if you are going to use it as expanded storage for windows.",5
5064,Write protected device supplied,"I bought this product after consulting the SJCAM online support team chat. They suggested that a Sandisk Extreme U3 class microSD card would be good enough. But after purchasing when I tried installing the memory card in the camera it displays memory card required. I checked the memory card in my pc and tried formating it in FAT32 format but the error comes up everytime as a write protected device. I finally used AOMEI PARTITION ASSISTANT and formated the memory card in FAT32 and initially it showed ""unable to execute the operation due to error code 106"" which translates to bad physical sector. Upon continuous repeated effort, the card somehow started working in the camera. Initially a lot of glitches came up and sometimes the sensitivity of the cam acts crazy as if it has its own intelligence but over all the memorycard which I had received wasn't that much of pleasing product. Initial impressions were already chaotic and rather scary. Someone invests in a product like this and gets such dramas thrown at like write protected, definitely it won't be a pleasant experience at all. Since I have the technical knowledge to some extent, I was able to rectify the problem in my product, but many may not be that capable.",3
5065,For Rs.1799 as of Jan 2021 | from Appario Retail,"Bought for Rs. 1799 as on ending of Jan 2021 SanDisk Extreme Pro 128gb A2 U3 V30. I have already owned 64gb version for my Gopro which works very well. But i do find some difference in the back of card.

Total user space available 119gb, 9gbs are not usable. Read write speeds are ok not as advertised, not much of a difference to be very frank. Some files dp get corrupted here and there on Gopro it might be because of the speed or gopro issue but it's very very rare like 1 in 100 videos or 1 picture in 5000 pictures.

Seller: Apprario Retail PVT. LTD. Good seller!",5
5066,A smart & excellent product...,An excellent product but way to highly priced in these times. Good storage capacity & easy to format and install. Haven't yet had the opportunity to access fully it's working potential as I've only just installed it.,5
5067,Best sd card and superb value for money,"Does it job perfectly. Has enough speed to handle 4k. I use it on my smartphone, mijia sphere 360° panaromic 4k camera and Go Noise play 2 action camera.

All of the abive has 4k abilities and this SD card handles them the best.

I know its expensive compared to other sd cards but this is sandisk extreme made for special task. Hence the pricing has to be accordingly.

I would recommend this card in its class.",5
5068,genuine but looks fake,"brought it on prime day sale for Rs.1800.
initially straight from the unboxing, I taught the product is fake looking at,it, since the finishing & product paint color is way poor & feels knock off memory card but after contacting & registering the product with SanDisk got a relief that the product is 100% genuine. the model no of this variant is SDSQXA1-128G-GN6MN, there's another variant available with Adapter but cost Rs.600 more which is not justified.",4
5069,Card - Dead on arrival.,"I have had tremendous success with Sandisk products in the past. I have 2 other exact cards as this, so when I got the item during our travels in India, I just opened it up and put it in my camera bag. Well, now conveniently about 6 hours after the 10 day return window I put it in my camera and the card is faulty. My computer won't recognize it either. It never even crossed my mind that the card would be faulty from the package. That just sucks...",1
5070,"Possibly fake product, 1 Adapter missing, read speed is half","I bought two of these cards. As you can see from the benchmarks, (1 RW, 1R, per card), the write speed is acceptable, but read speed is half that of the advertised one.

Advertisement says: ""SanDisk Extreme uSD,160MB/s R, 90MB/s W,C10,UHS,U3,V30,A2, 128GB, for 4K Video on Smartphones...""

As others have mentioned, the write speed is really low and one adapter is missing, even if you can see it mentioned on the packaging.

Even the color are different, check image that has two 128GB cards.

Disappointed, but then remember, SanDisk read speeds are always a lie. Only delivers half the speed.",1
5071,It's 477GB. Fast as advertised. VFM.,"First impressions - It has 477GB and not 512GB. I wonder what it has to occupy 35GB of space. We have 32GB SD as well, so doesn't feel justified to allocate 35GB of hidden files. Made a opening video this time because last time after opening had got a packet without SD card. Otherwise, the SD card is without hitches, smooth functioning and fast as advertised.",5
5072,fake products,Plz frds don't buy this product 🙏. Dealer providing fake memory cards unfortunately I did check cards today I am checking those...i tried gopro and laptop and mobile its not working I wast my 2.4k to my this fake products,1
5073,Cheap and fast....VFM Storage,"Great VFM option for fast storage.
Have t=3 of these for use in my Sony FDR-X3000R (action cam), SONY A7M3K (full frame cam) and DJI Mavic Air (Drone).
All of these devices are cable of doing 4k 100mbps and the card is good enough for that.
Have not faced any data corruption till now.
Write speed is fast enough even when using the card with the adapter in the A7M3. Have not faced any issue wherein the buffer wasnt able to write to the card or the cam stopped shooting as the card was not fast enough to clear the buffer.
In comparison the SanDisk Extreme Pro SD card costs 1.3k more than this and offers only 10MB/s more of read speed. Hence getting the MicroSD for the cam was a no brainer.\
If you are looking for cheap and fast storage, get this eyes closed.",5
5074,Dublicate Of SanDisk Ultra,"डिलीवरी पर्सन का बिहैवियर बहुत ही खराब था। वह झगड़े में उतर आया था। हमने upi पेमेंट के लिए कहा तो पर्सन बोले कि तुम्हें पता भी है upi क्या होता है? अमेज़न से कभी खरीददारी की भी है? बहुत ही गंदा था व्यक्ति।

5075,5 star review,There is nothing new to say about Sandisk's product. Sandisk's memory cards are always great. I always use Sandisk's memory card. These memory cards provide better service after the warranty period has passed. Excellent and premium product. It has an adapter also. Value for money. Very good seller.,5
5076,Zero working adapter.,I have bought card with adapter. The card is original but the adapter is some cheap duplicate one. The seller has pinned the adapter over the original SD card package. I have paid ₹100 extra for the adapter alone which was not even working. It was rusted and doesn't fix properly in the device. I want to complain the seller to Amazon.in but I'm unable to find where to complain and give seller feed back. Don't buy adapter from this seller.,3
5077,Fraud work of China and fraud promise,"Read write Speed is too much slow but promised as highest, heating and Hanging my phone lot...games are too slow...
Prices are too High, soon people are not gonna use less than 1 or 2 TB it's old Fashion now but still prices are 2 High..for 256,400&512 Gb.storage showing approx 238 gb only.",1
5078,FRAUD,It was a fraud. I received the package. Later I opened the packaging and I saw that the SanDisk packaging was torned and when I checked the memory of the card then it was only 7 gb instead of 128 gb. It was a footpath product. The outer packaging was completely packed but the SanDisk packaging was torned.,1
5079,Not happy,Not happy. With amazon help am able to return and refund. Sandisk adapter is in question even after paying extra I get this item as shown in picture. I question its authenticity and way the adapter is packaged is not ideal sandisk product.,1
5080,Misleading title and ads,"Bought it solely for its advertised Read/Write speed.

Its a total fraud.

They mention 160MBps R/90 MBps W on ""compatible hardware"".

They get away with this gross misrepresentation of R/W speed behind this ""compatible hardware"" bs.

What i know is that even on top end hardware (my galaxy S21 ultra) this card at best gives 80 MBps read and no more than 65 MBps write.

Go for sd cards of other brands i didn't expect western digital to do this.
I don't even think this is uhs 3 or A2 certified.",1
5081,Irror in 3times,"My Sd card Got irror. First time i formated i think it will be fine again it shoes irror i lost my 80gb of data (gopro vdo of marrege function)
Very desapointed with this one. For gopro use plse use 64gb its better than this ..",1
5082,Satisfied! But . . .,"I bought it for my phone (S9+) and these are my observations,

Write speed: 20MBPS max. Fluctuates between 15 and 20.
Read speed: 50MBPS max.

Yes it can record 4k 30fps videos without any issues. I don't know about 4k 60fps as it goes to internal memory by default.

It's a good package for this price. If you are looking for an alternative you can check out Samsung Evo Plus which costs some 200 ruppes more.

Nothing extremely satisfactory but does the job for you. Pretty good for an average consumer.",4
5083,After sales support worst and product broken into half,"Don't buy this product after using it for 6 months now this one is literally broken into half using it with the adapter provided by sandisk itself when I ejected it broken only half came out this is to mention that I am great fan of sandisk and using it almost for a decade now the customer care doesn't pic up or the call goes for so long.
Please don't buy this product after sales support is not good",1
5084,Great 128gb JE - MMC Card received from Amazon,"I received original Scandisk extreme 128Gb A2 U3 card from Appario Retail P. Ltd.
I got to know only after I registered my product on scandisk.com for warranty.
And it passed speed test for write and read on mobile apps. It's really faster MMC i have ever purchased.",5
5085,Worst experience with sandisk sd card,"Life of sandisk sd card is 2 yrs after that corrupted or locked ( unable to edit or delete )
Better to use other brand.
Low grade product.",1
5086,Best product from SanDisk,I am so grateful to Sandisk for manufacturing 256 gb memory card compatible for smartphones and also Amazon India for shipping the product at the expected date.I am very happy using the product.Thank you.Had a good experience shopping in Amazon.,5
5087,High cost.,This is costly product and speed is not very fast. I used it in honor view 10 mobile phone as USB drive. My phone's memory is 6 gb 128 gb internal. I don't know why this memory card costs so high. I expects its cost for rs. 1200/- maximum.,3
5088,SANDISK? THE BEST!,"I have always purchased SanDisk memory cards; no two minds about it!

I just decide on the storage capacity and writing speed and buy what suits me the best.

Use them as advised and they will last long.

This card is in use; will update my review as and when needed.",5
5089,Good !!,"It was really odd when I inserted this chip into my laptop it didnt't show SanDisk but SDXC Card. Apprehensive that it could be fake, did a little research on my own - turns out it is a genuine product. Go for it this is a great chip for your smartphones.",4
5090,The scratch card code was exposed and used by the seller,The scratch card on the memory card was used before it reaches to me. Please be carefull if you receive such product with the unique code is exposed which is supposed to be scratch by the user. Return such item.,2
5091,Price of storage device is always on higher side.,Product is good only. If you have a lot of super duper extra money then you can buy this card. The price of 256gb memory card should have not been more than Rs.2000/. Thus this company makes huge money like billion trillion dollars. Respective sellar is selling like gold coins. Very very high price considering tiny size. I know there is a lot of research and technology behind this product. Still its price is on very higher side. This opinion of mine applys for all memory cards of all brands.,3
5092,Damaged / Cut open cover,"Product received with cover opened up / Damaged condition.
Appears the card was tempered
Will insert in the device and check it’s storage n authenticity",1

every money I spent on the trip got waste as the content is now deleted.
Just let me know who is responsible for it??????",1
5095,Admired the Product.,"I brought this for my Gopro hero 7 Black,
Not sure about the data transfer speed ,cause I unplug & plug in to my phone once I done with the recording if you know what Im talking about,
Best for 4K recording.
If you do the same purpose as mine , then go for it, & yes one thing if you edit your footage on phone like me then you can diche Adaptor, or you can go with with adaptor its a personal preference. Im so lazy to upload pictures of my SD card haha, anyways I hope this short review helped you. Cheers",5
5096,SanDisk Extreme Cruel Speed and Massive Storage is your hands,SanDisk Extreme 256GB Memory card is worth to buying at 3499rs. It's very faster than other brands. The Read and Writting speed is just awesome. If you want to copy a files from laptop or PC's using a standard card reader for avoiding data loss. After installing this SanDisk extreme card is quick response and worked faster shutter speed. There is no issues about that Performance. This is genuine products and given a lastest manufactured products. Thanks a lot for Amazon and Team...,5
5097,Best For Action Cameras And Drones,"Those who want an Microsd card for their cameras and drones and are confused that this will run on their cameras or not ..let me tell you, This runs smoothly on my Gopro Hero8 and will also run smoothly on your cameraa too .",5
5098,It works with Gopro 7,"Good, needed so that I don't have to carry Laptop everywhere for file transfer. Its working fine with Gopro.",5
5099,Retriving images and videos fast,"Too much load on memory card, feels like being hard to retrieve data, go for extreme, it's extremely fast. I was out of india on vacation, and took a great amount of photos and videos and surprisingly retriving them was quite cool and fast. Moreover Amazon festive sale added low on pocket too.",5
5100,Good for Gopro,I have been using it for 1 month with my GoPro hero 9 and it works smooth and easily saved my 5k footage also.,4
5101,Worth every penny.,"I use this card with my Drone and record 4k 30fps D-log footage. It doesn’t heatup, the reading and transferring rate is pretty good.
Value for money and a good investment if you like recording using a drone or any action camera which shoots 4K footage.",5
5102,High price,Good but heavy price performance and build quality is normal dont expect too much like speed reading and writing 4k videos its didn't reached my expectations i am using in Galaxy Note 10plus,3
5103,A great product for 4K video capturing.,"A great SD card with superb performance. Now we all know on paper every test's result is ideal. So here too, it will not provide the speed as mentioned on cover but it'll be enough. So I believe you'll have no issues regarding this. Easily support drones, actioncams smartphones and almost everything. So go for it.👍🏻",5
5104,Awesome memory card. Mind blowing writing speed,"SanDisk is a reliable brand. Out of 128gb,it is showing 120gb is available which is pretty nice. It's writing/transfer speeds are awesome..It transferred a 1.5gb movie in just a minute..other memory cards would have taken 5-6 minutes to do so. So ,this SanDisk extreme is particularly awesome for it's transfer speed",5
5105,Perfect for 4k recording and high speed processing.,It gives me max of 75MB write speed which is great and i can use this to process files without actually loading into my file. Thiugh its little expensive but it has got lifetime warranty so its onetime purchase.,3
5106,Recommended for superior action cameras.,I purchased this microSD card for the DJI Osmo Action camera as it was recommended by DJI. Seems to be a good choice as the card is working well when compared to another SanDisk Class 10 card and a warning message would appear.,4
5107,Good product from SanDisk,"I haven't known much about SanDisk and this was my first purchase, based on the recommendations of my friends. It's being good so far. Hope and I strongly believe that it's a good product.
P. S. : Afterall the product is only 2 months old.",5
5108,Read speed is different and adaptor not provided,"I'm giving review after checking the memory card .I didn't get any adaptor and read speed is only 68 as per the given description read speed is 160 . It's avg product bcz read speed is different and adaptor is not provided , over all AVG product . I have a doubt that is it real SanDisk or fake SanDisk . Over all it okay product usable working fine",3
5109,👍Easy Replacement and Refund,"When I ordered first time 128GB memory card, it has duplicate means no Company print front of the memory card. After A Replacement having second memory card that is original one but That's never appear on any device like computer and mobile also. So, I want Refund. And it's Good to tell you.

5110,"Fast recording, works really well","Using it with my osmo pocket ,I had problems earlier with my older cards 4k never recorded fast enough and also it lagged between shots. Now this is so smooth, it records fast and it's ready for the next shot. Can't have those lags in recording during a vacation.",5
5111,Pathetic,Bought the card as I wanted to upgrade the storage capacity of my dashboard camera. The card memory went kaput after 3 days of usage. Sadly due to lockdown and all didn't get to use it sooner or would have returned it to Amazon. Now the card rests peacefully in my dustbin.,1
5112,Im a loyal Sandisk user. Using it for GoPro 9,"Excellent quality as always. I am using it since a month for my GoPro Hero 9 action camera and I am totally satisfied. I have been taking slow motion, TimeLapse etc and has been working smooth.",5
5113,Trusted name ..,Trusted name for sd cards and storages. But experienced a bit of lag and breaks while mirroring 4k videos to LED tv. Not sure whether its due to this. But same videos streamed well from phone memory. (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+),4
5114,The speed is remarkable,I was bit skeptical about the speed when purchasing. But then after using it found the speed is very good. The phone doesn't lag for apps installed on the card.,5
5115,Seller already scratched contest card,Everything is good but seller already scratched the contest card. Feeling sad for this 😔. Not accepted this kind service Amazon and Appario Retail Private Ltd.,3

Finishing is very good
In 128 Gb I got 119 Gb to use it is little dis appointing but still memory card doesn't get corrupt for longer years that's why I like this brand .
Talking about speed is decent.",4
5126,Good read and write speed (does what it tells),"The product is actually awesome, it gives 85mbps write speed in my redmi note 8 pro. Only one thing I am not getting that whenever i see the photos of my gallery saved in memory card it refreshes sometimes but nothing losts, the memory card is awesome, the recording of 4k videos (on redmi note 8 pro) can play them without any lag.. highly recommend",5
5127,Good product,"Advantages

2- MicroSD write speed in my device is 50+ MB/s and read speed140+ MB/s (it depending on your device and interface medium).
Overall read and write speeds much better, good product but price is much high.",4
5128,Penny worth item..,First thought it will be cointerfit product... Had checked with bar code and customer care.. N it was original... Plus the speed is good to and working fine,5
5129,Xtreme quality product 👍👍👍,"256gb price little bit high got prce 3825 ..use my oppo f19 pro Plus .. genuine product , durability is good . Excellent performance .. 👌👌👌",5
5130,Misleading specification,"Misleading specification.
39 Mbps write and 60 Mbps read.
Should have got the card from samsung instead.
Can record upto 4k 30. Using with my s20 plus cannot record 8k or 4k 60fps.
Waste of money.",1
5131,Micro SD card for 4k use,"Transfer Speed is too good.
storage is as usually 119 GB usable.
I am using in 4k recording and fast app loading performance on mobile.
No doubt go for it.its a genuine review.",4
5132,Good,Working fine with my Redmi Note 9 Pro Max,5
5133,Good for GoPro 7,Great product. Timely delivery. It does what it says. Go for it based on your requirements. Using it for my GoPro 4k recording.,5
5134,Unreliable,So this memory card crashed and I lost most of my data. I was able to recover few of the videos from a trip and most photos. But lost most of the videos. While using this on my gopro hero 9 it got corrupted in the middle of a video shot. And was asking me to format it in order to use it. Not at all reliable.,1
5135,Quality product,"won't recommend it to u for ur action camera. So, don't count on reviews saying, it supports 4k recording on GoPro hero 7 black, although it works fine on mobile devices with no issues whatsoever.",4
5136,Dont buy adaptor,"Adaptor selling with the card is faulty and low quality product ,Card is good",1
5137,faster than I expected,worth the extra bit. The speed is fast. the difference in speed between this and the pro plus is quite visible.,5
5138,6 Months In Running as Expected,"It is great. Do not expect the standard chart transfer speeds. You can write at about 30-45 MB/s.
What surprised me was the entirety of 128 GB was available for use-- I expected it to be less.

For now it is good, and I highly recommend it. In case a problem arises, I will change my review.",5
5139,"Writing speed is low, doesn't meet the discription.",I am using this with insta 360 one X2 and the camera is getting heat up very fast. The writing is speed is not as fast as mentioned in the discription. Not recommended for 4k or above quality long video of more than 5 minutes.,5
5140,Phone runs slow using this micro sd card,Don't think the sd card is to blame but my phone rubs very slow in saving Picts or transferring Picts using this card,2
5141,Not worth,"They have sent the card without adapter and charged money for with adapter.
Was getting a great deal on another app but preferred amazon.
Highly disappointed.",1
5142,Great Storage but high price,"This card is supported by all phones that support SDXC format.

5144,Buy pendrive for external memory,It's looks good but my memory card is not working after a month of usage,1
5145,Great speed & great quality,One of the best you could get at this price range. Write speed depends on your mobile device. My Redmi note 6 pro gives about 40 to 60 MB/s write speed which is more than enough for me to transfer data and use it as my primary storage.,5
5146,Fast downloading.,Using it for my action camera and it does a good job. Even downloading the videos to the Mac is faster.,5
5147,I have ordered this 3 times ...good product,Good product order it and then register it on SanDisk site to get benefit and check its authenticity,4

5867,Speed is not even near what is being advertised,"If you are spending around 2K extra on this Extreme edition card looking for speed then take a look what I have got, I could have saved Rs.2000/- easily by choosing Ultra 512GB card over this one. I am getting only 35MB/Sec write and 80MB/Sec read. Now some may think my device may not be capable to achieve the advertised speed, I am using it in Galaxy Tab S7+ and I have also tested it on my laptop where I got similar results.",2
5868,Plz ensure customer gets whatever he pays.,I was cheated as after paying >20000 rupees instead of 1TB card I got 32 GB card inside the packet.I had to take much strain to get my money back.Very bad experience .Of course this was first time with Amazon shopping.,1

5900,Good 4K video SDXC,The sdxc card is really good. The card is fast enough to process 4K video in real-time or capture 32mega pixel RAW images. Only shortcoming is it only has 366GB formatted capacity instead of the promised 400 GB.,5

5922,Great looking and color i love it and powerful motor 750 is awesome grinding machine,"Seit Jahren setze ich in meinen Kameras SANDISK Speicher ein.

Auch diese Speicherkarte ist ein Sandisk Qualitätsprodukt und mit einer lebenslangen Garantie ausgestattet.
Die wichtigen Performanceangaben dieser Karte lauten U3 und V30.

Damit ist die Karte durch die V30 Angabe für 4K Aufnahmen mit 60 fps und auch 120 fps in Video Kameras, Drohnen und anderen Aufzeichnungsgeräten geeignet. In meinem Fall soll sie in einer DJI Mavic Air ihren Dienst verrichten.
Zur Überprüfung der Performance habe ich mit der Version 6.02 des kostenlosen Tools „Crystal Disk Mark“ die Karte an meinem PC mit Hilfe eines USB 3.0 UGREEN Card Readers getestet. Das Testergebnis habe ich als Screenshot beigefügt.

Die erzielten Performance Werte von 94,02 MB/s beim sequentiellen LESEN und 66,19 MB/s beim sequentiellen SCHREIBEN bestätigen die ausgezeichnete Performance dieser Karte.
Einen Stern Abzug gibt es aber für die mir unverständlich erscheinende Aussage auf der Verpackung, wonach die Karte bis zu 160 MB/s Leserrate erzielen soll. Ich frage mich, wie man auf diese Angabe kommt. Die Schreibrate ist mit ihren tatsächlichen 66,19 MB/s sogar 10% höher als vom Hersteller angegeben.

Herstellerangaben auf der Verpackung:
Speed up to 160 MB/s read – 60 MB/s write

Die Karte habe ich für 25,99 EUR hier bei Amazon gekauft und sie erhält von mir eine klare Empfehlung, gerade auch im Hinblick auf den recht günstigen Preis. Schnell kann man nämlich für eine 64 GB Sandisk Extreme Pro (schwarz/rot) deutlich mehr Geld bezahlen (43,- EUR), obwohl sie lt. Spezifikation auch „nur“ V30 und U3 bietet. Sie mag im praktischen Test sicher bessere Werte liefern, wenn aber die Anforderungen des Gerätes mit einer Karte für weniger Geld auch erfüllt sind, muss man nicht zwingend mehr als nötig zahlen.

Einige erklärende Worte zu SD Speicher und ihren Spezifikationen

Ein Ausflug in das Bezeichnungswirrwarr von Speicherkarten, wobei ich die Reihenfolge nach ihrer Relevanz im heutigen Einsatz aufgeführt habe.

1. Kapazitätsangaben von SD Speicherkarten

SD: Secure Digital Memory Card mit bis zu 4GB Speicherplatz
SDHC: steht für High Capacity mit 4GB bis zu 32GB Speicher
SDXC: steht für Extended Capacity mit 64GB bis 2TB Kapazität

2. V-Angabe Video Speed – Mindest Schreibrate speziell bei VIDEO Aufnahmen

Die wichtigste Information beim Einsatz einer Speicherkarte als Video Aufnahmemedium stellen diese speziellen Performance Angaben dar, die leicht verständlich auswertbar sind.
Natürlich sind die U1, U2 und U3 Angaben (siehe weiter unten) sehr aussagefähig, wenn es um die Performance einer Speicherkarte geht. Mit der Angabe der Video Speed Class (V) kann man jedoch sofort erkennen, ob die Karte für die benötigte Aufnahme ausreichend schnell die Aufnahmedaten schreiben kann.
Der V-Wert gibt die MINIMALE Geschwindigkeit an, mit der VIDEO-Daten auf die Karte geschrieben werden. So kann man leicht ersehen, welche Karte für den benötigten Einsatzzweck notwendig ist.

V6 Video Schreibrate mindestens 6 MB/s
geeignet für 720p sowie 1080p und 1080i Aufnahmen

V10 Video Schreibrate mindestens 10 MB/s
geeignet für Full HD Aufnahmen und Echtzeitübertragung

V30 Video Schreibrate mindestens 30 MB/s
geeignet für 4K Aufnahmen mit 60 fps und auch 120 fps

V60 Video Schreibrate mindestens 60 MB/s
geeignet für 8K Videoaufnahmen mit bis zu 120 fps

V90 Video Schreibrate mindestens 90 MB/s
geeignet für 8K Videoaufnahmen mit bis zu 120 fps

3. Karten Klassen Class 2,4,6, 10 und U1, U2 U3

Früher waren die Class 2,4,6 und 10 Angaben noch oft verbreitet und üblich, die heute aber kaum noch für aktuelle Einsatzzwecke ausreichende Performance bieten. Die Zahlen hinter den Class Angaben geben die Mindest Schreibraten an. Eine MicroSd Class 10 Karte ist mit 10 MB/s SCHREIB Rate ausgestattet, eine Class 2 nur mit 2 MB/s.
Aktuelle Karten besitzen die neueren U Bezeichnungen.

U1 für 10 MB/s Schreibrate
U2 für 20 MB/s Schreibrate
U3 für 30 MB/s. Schreibrate

Geht es um Anwendungen im 4k oder 8k Video Aufnahme Modus, kommen nur U3 Karten in Betracht, die entsprechend hohe Werte bei der Schreibrate aufweisen. Aussetzer oder Abbrüche und Fehlermeldungen während der Video Aufzeichnung können die Folge sein, wenn eine Karte nicht die vom Gerät benötigte Video Schreibrate zur Verfügung stellt.

4. A-Angabe - Applikation Performance (Smartphones)

Diese Angabe ist für den Einsatz vor allem in Smartphones relevant, da damit die Mindest- Schreib und Leserate einer SD Karte definiert ist, wenn die Karte vom Telefon oder Tablet als aktiver Speicher genutzt wird. Die Performance wird damit in Abhängigkeit der Input/Output operations Per Second angegeben. Je größer der IOPS-Wert, desto schneller ist der Datenträger bei Einsatz in einem Smartphone oder Tablet. Hier kommt es weniger auf die maximale Schreibgeschwindigkeit an, sondern darauf, wie viele Operationen pro Sekunde auf bzw. mit der Karte möglich sind.

A1 Mindestleserate bei 1500 IOPS; Mindestschreibrate bei 500 IOPS
A2 Mindestleserate bei 4000 IOPS; Mindestschreibrate bei 2000 IOPS

5. Interface Spezifikationen UHS und Klassen I, II, III

Damit es noch etwas verwirrender wird, wurde auch für das Interface noch eine spezielle Spezifikation definiert. Nicht jede Karte läuft nämlich auch in jedem Gerät. Dazu muss man wissen, dass sowohl auf Karten-, als auch auf Geräte Seite Definitionen des Datenübertragungssystems existieren.

UHS-I:
Spec. V 3.01 mit 12,5 MB/s (SDR12), 25 MB/s (SDR25), 50 MB/s (SDR50, DDR50) oder 104 MB/s (SDR104)

UHS-II:
Spec. V 4.00 oder 4.01 mit 156 MB/s (FD156) bzw. 312 MB/s (HD312)

UHS-III:
Spec. V 6.0 mit 312 MByte/s (FD312) oder 624 MByte/s (FD624)

Ältere SD Speicherkarten, die eine UHS Kennzeichnung besitzen, sind mit SDXC und SDHC Karten kompatibel. Ohne eine zusätzliche Kennzeichnung der Klasse in Form einer I, II oder III kann die Datenrate jedoch niedriger sein.

Nachwort
MB/s Megabyte pro Sekunde ist NICHT zu verwechseln mit Mbit/s also Megabit pro Sekunde.
Die Internet Datenleitung liefert Daten nach Hause. Die Daten Übertragungsrate wird hier in Mbit/s angegeben. Ein Internet Anschluss hat beispielsweise 50 Mbit. Das heute übliche Gigabit LAN zu Hause bietet eine Übertragungsrate von 1 Gbit/s. Das hört sich nach viel an, aber im Vergleich mit den Daten Schreib- und Leseraten der Speicherkarten, ist es nicht wirklich annähernd so schnell. Nur das Gigabit LAN daheim kommt an die Geschwindigkeit von schnellen SD Karten heran.
Mit einem Gigabit LAN kann man theoretisch bis zu 125 MB/s übertragen. In der Praxis wird man meist deutlich unter diesem Wert bleiben. Der 50 Mbit Internet Anschluss hingegen ermöglicht es Daten mit maximal 6,25 MB/s zu streamen (Empfang).
Ich habe diese Info zu meiner Rezension hinzugefügt, da ich bei Gesprächen mit Freunden oft feststelle, dass Verwechselungen zwischen MB/s und Mbit bzw. Mbit/s an der Tagesordnung sind.",5
5923,Button problem. It is Working in apposit direction.,"I've got somewhat used to storage devices having less space on them than they advertise... but it is always jarring to see ""128GB"" on the label and find it only has 100GB space on it. More than a fifth of it is missing. Couldn't they at least have the decency to label how much space we get on these devices rather than some number that is X amount more that we can never use?",1
5924,Worst product,"Ho acquistato la SD per la Gopro 7 Black, purtroppo i nuovi formati essendo più pesanti facevano stoppare la registrazione dopo pochi minuti. All'inizio pensavo fosse la nuova action cam, poi ho sostituito la sd con una superiore, la pro, sempre di san disk, ed i filmanti non si stoppano. La extreme normale non ha i 90 mb di scrittura come dichiarato, quindi ho sostituito il prodotto. Per il resto la sd funziona bene ed è affidabile, quindi se non avete necessità di registrare in 4k va bene, al contrario comprate un prodotto più evoluto. grazie per aver letto la mia recensione.",1
5925,Worst Item Don't Buy,"Die Karte ist auf der Verpackung mit 160 MB/s Lesen und 90MB/s Schreiben angegeben.
Beim mehrfachem Kopieren verschieden großer Dateien 2-12GB kam ich zwar beim Schreiben unter Windows 10, exFAT und NTFS bis zu 80MB/s was ich voll akzeptiert hätte, aber das Lesen war nur halb so schnell wie beworben. Ich hatte die Karte vorallem wegen den angepriesenen 160 MB/s Leserate gekauft und 35 Euro mehr als für die mit 90MB/s Lesegeschwindigkeit angegebene SanDisk Extreme gleicher Kapazität gezahlt.
Vom Stuhl gefallen bin ich dann bei den 4K Schreib/Lese Datenraten.
Egal welches Tool ich verwendet habe kamen hier nicht mehr als 2,5 MB/s Schreiben (4k) raus bei ca. max 420 IO/s.
Hier die für SD Karten definierten Specs:
U1/U3: Diese Zahl drückt das Schreibtempo einer SD-Karte mit UHS-I- oder UHS-II-Technik aus.
U1 steht für 10 MBps, U3 für 30 MBps.
V6-V90: Das ist eine Schreibtempoangabe für Videoaufnahmen. Die Spanne reicht von 6 bis 90 MBps.
A1/A2: Bei diesen Geschwindigkeitsangaben schafft die Karte eine bestimmte Anzahl von Zugriffen pro Sekunde (A1: 1.500 beim Lesen, 500 beim Schreiben; A2: 4.000 beim Lesen, 2.000 beim Schreiben).

Die für die SanDisk Extreme 400G angegeben Werte wie U1 und V30 schafft sie natürlich locker.
Die Angebe A2: schafft sie aber nach meinen Messungen um Faktor 3-4 NICHT! ( siehe Screen Shot)
Die Karte schaft nicht einmal die A1 Einstufung!

Ich finde es hilft auch nicht auf der Rückseite mit nur mit der Lupe lesbar zu schreiben, dass man um 160MB/s zu erreichen ein passendes Device benötigt. Aber was das für ein ""device"" denn sein soll bleibt völlig im Unklaren.
Nach genauerem Web-Studium fand ich heraus, dass das Karteninterface UHS-I sowieso nur max. 105 MB/s kann.
Die 160 MB/s sind nur mit einem UHS-2 Karteninterface möglich, dass die Karte ja gar nicht hat, oder vielleicht doch?
Ich hab mir jetzt von SanDisk den UHS-2 USB-C Reader bestellt und werde das mal interesse halber prüfen.

Die Zahlen auf der Verpackung sind jedenfalls reines Marketing.
Die Karte funtioniert in Photokameras bestimmt ganz gut auch beim Filmen mit 4K Auflösung.
Meine Canon M50 schreibt mit max. 150 Mbit/s bei 4 k Video.
Ich habe auch die Serienbildfunktion der M50 mit large JPG und paralleler large RAW Speicherung getestet.
Nach ein paar Sekunden fängt die Kamera an zu stottern und muß erst ihren Buffer wegschreiben.
Meine 2 Jahre alte ADATA SDXC KArte die nur mit 45MB/s Write angegeben ist verhält sich übrigens identisch.
Also auch hier kein Praxisvorteil.
Zum Vergleich, die SanDisk ""Ultra"" kostet bei gleicher Kapazität 35,- Euro weniger, die tuts auch für die Kamera.
Und selbst meine 2 Jahre alte ADATA verhält sich mit der nagelneuen Canon M50 gleich.
Spart euch das Geld für eine schnelle SD Karte!
Die Kameras, Laptops und Mobilphones brauchen erst einmal das schnelle UHS-2 Interface,
und momenten eher selten zu finden.",1
5926,"Worst product, do not buy","I was really excited to read all the great reviews about this product. I decided to order because of the great price, great reviews and trusted that the product will be a genuine product. After several use with slow transfer and read rate and the best part is it deletes photos and videos randomly. I have decided that it is time to let other buyers know to be beware when buying this product. I am currently in the process of returning this item. I am very disappointed with the buy and I don't recommend.",1
5927,Very bad experience,"jnhショップ からはSDカード系は買わない方がいいと思います。

5930,Not recommended,"Me corrijo a mí mismo: He podido comprobar que con un lector concreto de Sandisk (""Sandisk SD UHS-I"", https://amzn.to/2VQQNPe) sí alcanzan tales velocidades. Por lo que he visto online parece que sólo este lector es capaz.
Opinión original:
Vaya por delante que lo de ""hasta 160 MB/s"" me parece una marcianada, de hecho UHS-I tiene un límite de 104 MB/s como ya pone un poco más arriba y no está muy claro cuáles son esos ""dispositivos compatibles"".
Dejando el tema de la velocidad teórica a parte, SanDisk es mi marca de referencia para tarjetas de memoria y la gama Extreme no defrauda. Velocidad aproximada de 90MB/s de lectura y 80MB/s de escritura en mi unidad. Cumple con creces la certificación U3/V30. La A2 imagino que también aunque no la he intentado medir.

Por cierto, como todas las SanDisk Extreme, incluye una licencia de un año para el software RescuePro Deluxe, pero en este caso viene pegada a la parte interna del blister de cartón. Mala idea. Seguro que más de uno lo tira a la basura sin darse cuenta.",1

I took out the card and tried to format and it is registering as a 16GB! card! DO NOT BUY THIS CARD!!!!!",4
5932,Pathetic product quality and worst service,"Es muy decepcionante que una empresa como lo es Amazon permita que te vendan una memoria de 2Gb con el sticker de 400 Gb,
Pésimo producto",1
5933,Not satisfied,"i have been buying sandisk for years and they were the best - fast, reliable and excellent value. i have purchases a few sandisk usb flash drives, usb c and usb 3 and they all had one thing in common; highly unreliable and required regular (full formatting) after they for no reason stop copying and make windows crash. i thought i would give this sandisk product one final chance because its from their ""extreme"" range and i hadn't tried the sd cards so i thought benefit of the doubt. right from the packet, it made windows crash - not sure why but after restarting, i put it in saying error and let windows repair it. started copying my music, it was lightning fast - around the 60-70 mbs mark and about 1/3 way through 0! wouldnt respond and crashed windows. so, same process... FULL format and it worked ok but i had moved it to USB 2.0 just to be sure - i simply wanted to copy the files didn't really care about the speed.
put simply, i think i am done with sandisk now - i won't bother returning this now as i have my music on my phone and will leave it at that.
but if you want a micro sd card for regular use or any thing memory/flash related i REALLY advise you NOT to buy sandisk products as they ALL (i have had 4 sandisk flash based drives) and they all exhibit the same behaviour.
if you want very casual use and don't mind the occasional faffing around with formatting and stuff, then i suppose for the money they are OK.
also i have attached the benchmark - no 160mb ANYWHERE - even on the sequential read which is the fastest so i would go so far to say its a lie - same for the 90mb claim. stopped running the test after the sequential as it was known what was to follow with others.",1
5934,Money west product,"I bought this because I wanted to be able to shoot in 4k on my Samsung S9 so needed a quick card with plenty of storage space. It was supposed to replace a ""slower"" Sandisk Ultra. I don't expect to achieve the read/write speeds advertised as these were done in lab conditions. However the card was much slower than my Sandisk Ultra. I am getting maximum write speeds of 6.91MB/s. I am aware the storage capacity is always less than that advertised - but this card had less than 200GB. Maybe I was unlucky but my next mobile will simply have a much larger internal memory rather than messing around with dodgy microsd cards. If I can't even buy a reliable MicroSD card from Amazon as a seller themselves the time has come to move on.",1
5935,Defective product and not working,"El paquete me llegó abierto, no recibí ninguna memoria y estoy a la espera de ver si puedo recuperar mi dinero",1
5936,Disappointed !!!!,"Insgesamt gute Karte zu fairem Preis. Allerdings steht (Stand 27.9.18) in der Produktbeschreibung der 64GB-Version ""Bis zu 90 MB/Sek. Schreibgeschwindigkeit"". Auf der gelieferten Verpackung steht ""Bis zu 60 (!)MB/Sek. Schreibgeschwindigkeit"". Leider ist auf der Produktabbildung auch nicht die Originalverpackung zu sehen, auf der man die korrekte Angabe hätte erkennen können. Somit habe ich eine Karte mit geringerer Schreibrate bekommen, als ich glaubte zu kaufen. Dafür Punktabzug.",1

5938,Returned the product,Me ha parecido un producto perfecto. Hemos probado en diferentes dispositivos y se adapta perfectamente. Reconoce todo a la primera y no es necesario complemento alguno. Muy buena velocidad de traspaso de imágenes y de vídeos. Me parece un producto muy aconsejable. Ni una queja.,2
5939,Impressive,"Anyone claiming that the green backed microsdxc cards are fake needs to do better research. In all of Sandisk's marketing, they show a green backed microsd with the ""XC"" instead of ""HC"". In all reviews from reputable websites show the same.

Secondly, anyone complaining about how there is missing storage doesn't understand how marketing of high capacity storage media works. They calculate size based on 1000 kilobyte per megabyte not 1024 kilobyte per megabyte. If you bought the 128GB model, your device would see it as 119GB because your device calculates it as 1024KB per 1MB. It's been done this way for decades.
Here's a list of most of the capacities that SanDisk sells with their corresponding ""actual"" size.

32GB = 29.8023GB
64GB = 59.6046GB
128GB = 119.2093GB
256GB = 238.4186GB
400GB = 372.529GB
1TB = 931.3226GB

When you buy a hard drive, you also don't get the full capacity for the same reason. This isn't just SanDisk.

Third, the speeds of the card are ""UP TO"" x and y read and write. It's highly dependant on what device you're using it in and even then, those are burst speeds, it's not intended to sustain that speed for longer than a few seconds.

It's really sad to see an incompetent reviewer up at the top spot when this is a genuinely high quality product.",5
5940,Go for it and don't be very choosy by reading others scary reviews. Very powerful motor...,"First red flag was when I looked underneath the card. Instead of being solid black like every other SD card I've seen, it looked like a green circuit board with a strange black square on it.

Second red flag was the MUCH lower than advertised read/write speeds (only 50-55 write with mid 80s read).

Third red flag was when I tried to copy data from my old sd card on to this one. I was able to get about 21.5 GB of data on to it until it unmounted itself from my computer. I then physically removed the card and inserted it back in the computer. Windows recommended that I repair the drive, so I did. After that, I go and try to copy the data again and it unmounted itself, just like before. I tried the same thing by repairing the drive, except this time, Windows informs me that it could not be repaired! Seriously??

So much for trying to get a good black Friday deal...",5
5941,"Not goes with prestige of 'prestige' brand, don't grind ...",Performance is much slower than advertised. Screenshot attached and tested several times in an LG G7 ThinQ.,2
5942,Review after 3 months of daily use,"I've been buying these micro SD cards since I began using Android devices way back on 2.2. I stopped at 64GB cards as they were mainly for video. Now I store hi res photos from my SLR on my phone I need more.
Card class and speed has always been tricky to define due to advertising mainly read speeds, not write speeds. Class 10 means nothing more than it can sustain a 10mb/s write speed, that's it!

They have been getting better every few years and these A2 cards seem to be the best for speed v price.
My last card had a write speed of 50mb/s which I though was pretty good. This one blitzes it. I transferred 78GB of data to the card (a mix of hi res SLR shots, full HD movies, music and pc programs, over 5000 files) in 18 minutes, the card maintained over 80mb/s for all but the last 4 minutes of the whole transfer. It averaged 72mb's in total.

I've used Sandisk cards for over 20 years, I have never lost a single file from one yet (touch wood).
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5

5949,Xxx,"I am showing two read/write testing results here, but beware that they came from the same micro sd card. FYI I'm testing my micro sd card on a UGreen usb 3.0 card reader.

My initial test only gave me a read/write speed of around 40 MB/s like many others had here, which is way below my expectation. However, when I switched to the usb 3.0 port at the back of my desktop, the read/write speed significantly improved and met the SanDisk's claim of up to 90 MB/s. This makes me wonder whether everyone who thought he got the counterfeit was using the right port for testing, as many laptops have built-in card readers but not necessarily having the transfer capacity equivalent to usb 3.0 port (could be usb 2.0, which is around 40 MB/s).",1

5952,Good For house using within budget price,"Gute Speicherkarte aber : Lügt Sandisk dann auf der Verpackung ?

Selbstverständlich sind Speicherkarten von Sandisk eine ordentliche Marke.
Und natürlich lügt Sandisk hier nicht !
Die Datensicherheit ist sicherlich gegeben.
Die Verarbeitung der Karte selber gefühlt ist etwas schwach.
Die Geschwindigkeit ist OK, sie entspricht nur nicht im Geringsten des was auf dem Etikett steht. Zumindest auf dem ersten Blick.

Und hier fühlt man sich als Käufer irgendwie veralbert. Ja und albern ist dies schon.

Ehrlich, warum tut sich das Sandisk an ?
Lügt Sandisk dann auf der Verpackung?

Nein, natürlich nicht! Und wenn man das kleingedruckte liest findet man heraus dass die Karte normal nur maximal 104 MB/s liefern kann. ES SEI den man nutzt einen speziellen Kartenleser von Sandisk. Dann bringt die Karte auch ungefähr die versprochenen Werte.

Die Karte kann an einem normalen Reader / Gerät / Kamera NIEMALS die versprochenen Leistungswerte erreichen. Da die Karte eben eine UHS I Karte ist und da ist eben bei 104 MB/s Schluss.

Mal offen in Raum gestellt, welche Kamera, welches Handy unterstützt den diese Proprietäre Technologie außer einem Sandisk Karten Leser?
Ehrlich Sandisk, da fällt doch der Mehrwert für eure Kunden doch sehr mager aus.
Wo ist der Punkt in einer Karte mit UHS II Leistung und einer zu geringen Bus-Geschwindigkeit ?

Generell darf man sich auf die Zuverlässigkeit des Flash Speichers sowie den internierten Controllers. Man darf auch annehmen, dass Sandisk nahe der Oberfläche des Substrates einige Testpunkte für eine eventuelle Datenrettung angebracht hat.
So etwas kostet ja nichts beim Design, aber hilft dann doch weiter.
Natürlich ist dies jetzt keine Endurance Speicherkarte sondern vermutlich eine ganz normale MLC Flash Karte.

Die Physikalische Verarbeitung von Sandisk Speicherkarten ist subjektiv immer etwa mager.
Das ist nur mein persönlicher Eindruck, aber ihrgendwie sind die Karten von Sandisk immer etwas weniger wertig in der Handhabung. Die Kontaktflächen scheinen irgendwie dünner zu sein. Fakt ist ich habe mehr äußerlich defekte Sandiskkarten als von anderen Herstellern. Und eigentlich vermeide ich Sandisk Karten zu kaufen. Eben aus diesem Grund. (Aber Sandisk ist eben immer verfügbar. )
Vielleicht ist dies einfach nur blindes Pech, aber die Karten anderer Hersteller erscheinen bei mir länger halten zu sein. Vielleicht liegt es daran dass Sandisk Febless produzieren läst.
Hier wird die preiswerteste Fertigungsstätte wählen welche noch die eigenen Kriterien und Standards gewährleistet. Andersrum wird Sandisk auch nur genau das bekommen was spezifiziert ist. Dies hat Vor und Nachteile.

Fazit : Nicht meine erste Wahl aber Sandisk ist schon OK.",4
5953,Good motor capacity and average body and jars quality,"Produto autêntico Sandisk, aceita cadastro no site do fabricante, tem a memoria correta, porem não pertence as especificações de velocidade impressas no produto, atinge somente picos de 30Mbs tanto leitura quanto gravação.

La capacità totale si ferma a 119GB
Avendo molte Action Cam, GoPro 4/5/6/7 e una Garmin Virb 360 per le registrazioni in 5.7k serve una scheda innanzitutto compatibile e che abbia una velocita di scrittura elevata.
Oltre a questa Sandisk Extreme possiedo anche la Extreme pro che ha una velocità di trasferimento maggiore, ma in scrittura sono praticamente uguali.
Con le Sandisk non ho mai avuto problemi, sono durature e un paio sono diversi anni che le uso.
Sono davvero le migliori schede in commercio.
Logicamente vanno bene anche per gli Smartphone anzi questo tipo A2 e proprio perfetta per installare le app sulla scheda ed usarle tranquillamente come se fossero in memoria sul telefono senza rallentamenti.
Io questa da 128Gb ho dovuto acquistarla da mettere in macchina sulla Garmin Virb 360 che uso come DashCam, registrando in 5.7K mi serviva dello spazio, ci stanno 1:30 minuti di registrazione e mi bastano visto che registra in Loop cancellando la registrazione più vecchia automaticamente, ma per altri usi consiglio di acquistare più schede di taglio inferiore,32Gb o 64Gb, cosi se ci fossero problemi di rottura o perdita della stessa non si perdono 128Gb di filmati o foto.

5955,Worst product broken in one month,"Pretty sure its not a fake, as all the major check out and I got it from Amazon.ca not a marketplace seller. Things that I have cheked:
The appearance of the package (text is very crisp and the paint looks like high quality paint, with deep colours and also some reflective paint.The quality of the image is comparable to a genuine Ultra Plus purchased at best buy. There is a sticker inside the package that promotes their android app, same as the Ultra Plus. The rear looks as crisp as the front.)
The adapter (text looks legit when compared to the genuine one I have, date is printed on the back, also very crisp. I compare a known genuine adapter to the included adapter in the photos.)
Card appearence (The text is crisp, same font and text positionning as the Ultra Plus, but the rear destabalised me a little, whit the black sticcker on the green PCB, I expected faint writing on a black PCB)
Card capacity and speed (As can be seen in the photos, the write is around 70MB/s and read is 75MB/s and the capacity checks out without any errors.)
What scares me the most is that the read speeds aren't even near the advertised maximum of 160MB/s, but it might be bottlenecked by the integrated sd card reader of the laptop I used. The fact that the card states that it is made in china is also offputting, because the Ultra Plus from best buy states that it is made in Malaysia, which is what I expected for this card. Finally, the green PCB with the black sticker also makes me feel off about it.
The GoPro H7 Black didn't seem to refuse this card for filming a short 4k60 clip, but then again it also worked with the Ultra Plus which has lower advertised speeds and isn't recommended for this use.
So if you are willing to take your chances as I did, just be sure to get it from Amazon.ca and not a marketplace seller (not that I have anything against them) for the best chances of it being real and not counterfeit.",1

5957,Features without build quality,"I bought these for full day recording for a travel video. I used a Hero 6 and an external battery pack. After only one day's use (about 7 hours of recording time) I switched the first card out for the second card (despite the 9 hour estimated capacity on the first card [two hours remaining on the card]).

The next morning, when I tried to download the first card, I got continuous SD errors. I was able to recover the video files using the GoPro app, but the video files are corrupted with lots of dropped frames. So basically, just one day into a 10 day trip, I was down to one card. Fortunately the second card worked for the rest of the trip, but required daily downloading.

Given the price of these, and the brand, I expected better.

Once back home, with access to my PC and recovery tools, the only resolution was to format the first disk, which now has 20 GIG of dead space. Not impressed.

UPDATE
I Sent the card into Sandisk for a replacement under a valid RMA from their customer support. The mail tracking says they received the dead card back in March. It's now mid July and as of yet I have still not received the replacement card. Every time I call Sandisk Global Support it's a constant stream of excuses, and false apologies.. While this is not a ""vendor"" issue, you need to keep in mind that, when purchasing this card, manufacturer support (which is all you are left with once you use the card and it fails, sucks... big time.",4

5960,Extremely noisy and very poor quality product,"El producto llegó en tiempo y forma, viene bien empaquetado y todo parece indicar que no hay ningún problema, la recibí ayer y ahora la estoy probando en una GoPro 5, graba en 4k sin problemas",1
5961,Good product,Do NOT buy this card - it’s fake. My GoPro freezes and the only reason a brand new GoPro will freeze is because the card is fake.,4
5962,Nice,"Comprado para una GoPro Hero 7 Black. Con esta capacidad da para unas 4 horas de vídeo en 4k 60 fps.
La velocidad de escritura es perfecta para la cámara ya que no tiene ningún problema al gestionar la grabación en calidad máxima.
Es de agradecer también la resistencia a temperatura, agua y golpes. Muy útil para este tipo de cámaras de acción.",4
5963,Didn't Even Last For A Day,"I was slightly skeptical at first. I only purchased the SanDisk 400 GB Extreme card after seeing the positive reviews here, along with knowing that Amazon would also be fulfilling the order.

However, I still wanted to be sure that the SD card was legitimate before using it to film 4K H.265 footage.

I tested the SD card using H2testw (v1.4). I used the SD card slot of a Surface Book 2 with a BaseQi SD card adapter. The test results were inline with real world expectations (the computer was also being used for other projects whilst the test was in progress).

I also compared the SanDisk 400 GB Extreme to a SanDisk 64 GB Extreme and SanDisk 128 GB Extreme Pro I had purchased from a reputable local retailer. The fonts and logo all appear to match perfectly and the physical layout of the pins and memory chip match exactly, and the text and serial number layout on the back also match.

The warranty details listed inside the packaging were also for my region and contained correct contact information.

It's fair to say that these cards are genuine and you should be confident in your purchase.

Below are the H2testw results:
Warning: Only 375558 of 375560 MByte tested.
Test finished without errors.
You can now delete the test files *.h2w or verify them again.
Writing speed: 78.7 MByte/s
Reading speed: 84.7 MByte/s

5964,Worthwhile product,original y a un precio mas bajo que en la tienda,5
5965,Faulty product delivered twice!! No return. Only replacement.,"Esta tarjeta es perfecta para grabar en 4k; yo la utilizo en una cámara deportiva YI, y me funciona perfectamente sin cortes (está recomendada por el fabricante). Se diferencia de la Extreme Pro (""SanDisk Extreme Pro 64 GB microSDXC UHS-I""), más cara, tan sólo en la velocidad de lectura (170 mb/s de la Extreme Pro frente a 160 mb/s de la Extreme), porque la velocidad de escritura es la misma en las dos (90 mb/s), que es lo importante a la hora de grabar.",1
5966,Not as prestige product,Chip pirata,2
5967,Simply ignore this product!!,The real capacity is not 64 GB as printed on the SD card but around 27 GiB (32 GB?). The card did not load initially because it was partitioned incorrectly.,1
5968,Very bad quality mixer,This turned out to be a dud. I didn't use it for some time. My first mistake as I normally try things out quickly in case they need to be returned. I noticed write speed was very slow in my modest digital camera. (Not so modest as a Sony RX10 M4 which normally writes almost instantaneously to another Sandisc with the same rating) Tried taking a video which showed up the very slow write speed. Did some speed test with software suggested by Sandisc. This showed how horribly slow this card was and turned out not to be from Sandisc after contacting them. I can use possibly use this card in another device where write speeds are not so critical. Best avoided.,1
5969,Wrong Product Received,"I ordered 3 cards (64GB with up to 160MB/s) from them for my drone and when I tested them multiple times The highest score that I got for the reading part was 73MB/S which is far, like really FAR from the 160MB/s.

I have got in touch with the seller to hopefully find a solution to this issue and hopefully change the rating of my review if we can find an agreement.

Until then, so many comments about counterfeit cards and I'm starting to believe them myself. I've always have SD cards and never got any problems when it came down to testing the speed and capacity with a slight difference but was alright with it but missing 90MB/s on a card is NOT acceptable at all.
So many of us photographer/videographer/drone flyer and such are looking for the right product that will last and is reliable. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. Disappointed.",2
5970,Low cost but very noisy mixer grinder,"I have seen other reviews on here complaining about the transfer rates on this memory stick. I have purchased (for about £6) a USB3 car reader from Anker and this is giving me the speeds shown, its about 80B/s write and about 90 read, so not as fast on read as what is suggested, but that is still very acceptable. Please note that a number of factors come into play when using storage like this. The CPU will do a lot of the work, so will need a good CPU to see full speeds, also the drive being transferred from or to needs to support the speeds you want to see. In my case, I am seeing these speeds from both mechanical drives and NVMe drive in my PC.

With regards to space, please understand what a GB is, its 1000,000,000 bytes, where as a GiB is 1,073,741,824 bytes, so, for example, to work out the space you are buying, if you buy 128GB, or 128,000,000,000 bytes (it states this on the packaging too), you divide that number by 1024 3 times and it will show you how many GiB you end up with. I get 119GiB which = 128GB. 238GiB=256GB and 372GiB=400GB. Please ensure you understand space calculations before you complain that what you purchased does not match up to what is shown in Windows. The space shown on the packaging is actually correct (giga = billion, gibi is based on the 1024 calculation of space used by computers and this is acutally what windows shows).

I will look at getting more of these as required in the future, using this one in my drone for 4K video recording",3
5971,Worst Mixer Grinder ever!,"I bought this for a new phone.

The phone has been doing weird things lately. Like it keeps turning the screen on when it's set down on a table even though nothing is touching it.

I also get calls from people I don't want to talk to. It's like they let just anyone phone my number.

I don't think any of this has to do with the SD card which seems to work perfectly.
5 stars.",1
5972,best Mixer Grinder in market,"For those who say ""Its is only 119gb"" That is correct when Read By Windows . The reason for this difference lies in the way hard drive manufacturers advertise their devices, versus the way Windows computers actually use the storage devices. ... Unfortunately, Windows has always calculated hard drives as powers of 1024 while hard drive manufacturers use powers of 1000. So when windows reads it its calculating every gig as chunks of 1024 so for every 1024 mb it reads 1 gig . So for windows to use 1gb it requires More then 1000mb, hence the 1024. Windows will read it Less than the Manufactures stated Total Capacity . They ARENT FAKE its only Computer illiteracy and understandable, its confusing to the average person . THESE ARE REAL and WORK FINE . Stop Rating 1 stars because you dont know any better .",5
5973,Valuable for money,"As I stated in my Kingston SD card review I buy a lot of SD cards.
So many devices in my household.

For tablets and phones I tend to use Kingston as they offer a little better value when on sale and I don't care about data loss as things sync with cloud. Also for situations where they will get lost etc. (damned kids)

For anything that requires high capacity and storage speeds, Sandisk extreme is in my opinion the only real option.
I always keep a few 64 and 128GB cards ready to go with my GoPros.

These cards just work no matter what type of footage you are recording. I have never had one fail despite a few accidental washings with jeans.

I also use these cards in my dash cams. Main reason is a dashcam in the window of a car can get hot and these seem to handle the heat better than some others.

You can save money buy buying from other brands however after purchasing what must be over 50 cards over the years SanDisk Extreme are my only cards for 4k and 8k recording.",5
5974,Stopped working after 6 months,"Great cards, but don't buy from ""Base"". They are located in Switzerland & are priced the same, but won't give you a VAT invoice. This makes the cards 20% more expensive that other suppliers for VAT registered buyers.",1
5975,Prestige is not worried about its prestige anymore.,"The number of devices that MicroSD cards work with now has increased demand, which in turn has really brought the price down of these fantastic cards. I don't use any other brand now that I know I can rely on SanDisk (having previously used them for several years without a fail in a dashcam and tablets).

On top of being ultra reliable, they come with A2 App performance. You may think A2 isn't as good as A1, but it actually means read and write speeds are at least doubled (usually more). This makes them ideal for recording video in a dashcam, CCTV camera or video doorbell that produces high definition video at a high frame rate (does footage look laggy if movement is fast?)

It comes with a microSD to SD adapter so that the card can be plugged directly into a card reader or laptop. It also comes with recovery software but I have never had to use it in the past and don't expect to in the future either.

I will continue to trust in and spend my money on SanDisk and recommend that you do the same. You will not be disappointed.

If you found my review helpful, please remember to let me know.",2
5976,Don't go only for PRESTIGE brand ...,"Like other people here. The micro SD card I received doesn't work, on my PC or camera it doesn't recognize it. I've tried an other one and both can recognize so it's definitely a problem with this card.
I've contacted the customer support and after 10 days still no reply.
What a WASTE OF MONEY!
I'll never buy from SanDisk ever again....",1
5977,"Good for daily use, and durable.",Ho aspettato un po’ prima di recensirla per essere più obiettivo. Acquistata per il mio drone mavic mini devo dire che sono pienamente soddisfatto! Ottima capacitata di archiviazione. Velocità buona. Ha l’adattatore incluso. Imaballo ok. Spedizione in tempi record,5
5978,Not worth the name,"Well what can i say, other than SanDisk is always been my memory brand choice. I brought three of these. First one at the time costing alot more than they are now. Ive always worried about getting fake ones etc. However ran the basic tests and everything was great, 2 years later and still going strong. And im constantly removing and adding files, putting it into different phone or tablet. I usually buy a new one every 2 years when i get a new phone and put existing one in a storage case and use when ever. However this isnt really because im concerned but more about the price drops, example you can now buy a 200gb for the price of a 64gb nearly 2-3 years ago. So for me ive always gone for more space when i can, more bang for the buck. Anyways great micro SD card, and havent brought myself around to trying samsungs own because i have never had issues with SanDisk",1
5979,Good quality product,"I have only ever bought Sandisks for my Gopro and my previous Drift Stealth 2 HD action camera. I have both Ultra's and this - my preferred choice - the Sandisk Extreme.
This card, recording in 1080p at 60 fps provides me with just under 4 hours of recording. The quality is great for social media sharing so I don't bother in recording in the 2k or 4k option much but I did test the card out with a few 4K videos and it performed perfectly (better than the Ultra's but the playback from the ultra card in 4K recording could have been pc which isn't a 4k one. This is important to know as some people assume it is card error).
All in all a great product. Comes with an SD adapter too.",4
5980,Don't prefer online better buy in stores,"I use these in a Nextbase dashcam . I’ve tried many different ones however SanDisk are by far the best in terms of clarity of picture,reliability and durability.
(Beware of where you buy them - there are many cheap fakes available online elsewhere).",1
5981,"Money waste product, go for local brands it works much better than this","In general, the dashcam is very temperamental. It does not work with some SD cards, even the one the manufacturer is giving as incentive for a review, which I bought myself. I tried two SanDisk SD card 128gb.
After few days, I checked the recorded videos. I realised the last video clips (before switching off the engine) are always corrupt. I switched back to the factory power supply. The issue continued. BTW, I was using a different power supply as I want to continue to use the cable from a previous dashcam (same manufacturer) Therefore, I returned the camera and got another one.

New one was still very temperamental, however I later found out that the supplied power supply is not powerful enough to charge the flat battery while in operation with the three cameras. When the battery was empty, it was deactivating the rear camera for about 30 secs. I had to recharge outside the car and without the rear camera.",1
5982,Waste of money,Muy buen producto y a un super precio que bueno que no lo compre en tienda (best buy) son unos careros y venden todo segun a precios bajos pero pura mentira preferi por este medio por que me llego a mi domicilio y por que siempre he confiado de amazon prime,1
5983,Inferior quality service is decent,"I have only just made use of this Scan disk and it turned out to be damaged! Not sure why! I just annoyed that i didn’t make use of it immediately I purchased it (now it’s 8 days too late for refund)!

But with lockdown and being at home all the time there was no need to use it. But now when I had to go away, it turned out to be damaged!

I’m going to contact Amazon and see if there’s a solution to this.",1
5984,Most terrible and disappointing experience of using Prestige mixer grinder.,"So I started by doing a check to make sure it was a 128GB card and not a smaller one mislabelled. (I simply copied a 126GB file to it and compared the hash of that with the original, using HashCalc.) This passed just fine, but I was disappointed that the write speed, for sequential writes to a brand-new card, was only 27MB/s using the supplied micro-SD-to-SD converter.

This seemed odd, so I deleted the supplied partition (which didn't use quite all of the card), made a new one in the Windows-10 Disk Manager and formatted it as exFAT, which gave me a teeny bit more space. After this I got 80MB/s writes.

So, the card seems okay, the format as supplied not so much. But maybe something odd was going on? I'd say test yours and if it's slow kill the partition, make a new simple one and format it as exFAT then see how it goes.

Oh and the packaging is, as ever for micro-SD cards, a right pain to get into...",1
5985,Noise level and lekage,Genuine 128GB SD Card. Used H2testW to verify. Works on my Nintendo Switch.,1
5986,DO NOT BUY!!!,Brought this to using a dash camThe dash cam says he can take 128 go card sometimes it would work sometimes it wouldn’t when putting in the card that came with the camera the camera then works every time so there must be a problem with the card I’ve ordered a new card now to see if it’s the card or the camera that at the moment looking like there is a fault with the card,1
5987,Not a Good buy. Cheap quality-just bad and hopeless-Replacement not done-for a mixi used 3/4 times,"People often wonder why pay extra when you can get the same memory for cheaper? The simple answer is speed and extra reliability/ safety.

I put this is a GoPro Hero 8 for a kayak-camping trip down the whole length of the River Thames, UK. I was shooting 1080p and I came home with over 10 hours of excellent footage and I had no issues at with the card during the whole trip, in changeable outdoors conditions. Transferring files back home was lightning fast.

There's not an awful lot you can say about a memory card, but if you are a professional, or serious amateur, whatever you are buying SD cards for it's worth going that little bit further with your money and getting these pro versions. I won't use anything else now actually, and I use these for all my camera and audio equipment.",1
5988,Speed controller switch defective,"SanDisk advertises this as the fastest read UHS-I in the market (160mb)! Multiple tests on the 128GB don't confirm this claim. I tested the card on my Surface pro (2017), Surface GO and XPS 13 and got only 88mb read speed and 84 write speed at best!! My Samsung Evo select 128GB & 256GB have higher read and write speed.",1
5989,Prestige won't let yu down,"So I purchased this card for a nice little Windows tablet I purchased that only had a 128Gb internal storage eMMC drive which cost to half of the space taken up with Windows and so this allowed me to double it up and add an extra 128Gb for storage of my files for little cost.

Now this was purchased as I'd bought a cheaper brand the day before and had trouble writing to it so decided to buy this to see if a card issue and as this a brand I now well.

It arrived and comes complete with a full size SD card adaptor as well as the 128Gb Micro SD card, I popped it into the machine and I almost immediately see the 128Gb drive in my file explorer, it's formatted as exFAT yet again tried to write to the card and it said it was write protected, I tried formatting and hit the same issue, so I'm now thinking a machine issue. On a whim though I decided to hunt out a replacement SD card driver not using Windows Update and suddenly I had a fix, ecstatic and as I know knew both cards worked well I decided to test their read/write speeds etc and this card which should have been slightly faster actually came out slightly slower which was surprising as it was a higher rated card and more expensive. I can't comment on the longevity of the cards yet as obviously new but I think this one due to the slightly slower performance encountered and slightly higher price has to deserve 4 stars from me.",5
5990,Do not Buy! Pathetic Quality!,"I've A1 cards on my Single board computers for many years they make a huge difference on lag-reduction when running operating systems from them. They are designed to speed up the Random access read/write operations of the card so the requests to read and write small blocks of data unlike the Class10, U1, U3 etc dealing with the continuous throughput of data generally for large files.

So this card is A2 in theory twice as fast as A1 for those random operations and it really does make a difference

But not only is the card fast for small random read/write operations its also fast for data throughput rated @ U3 V30

They've always been pricey until i spotted the price drop and thought this would be a good price to test @£15 for 64gb, I'm very pleased of the performance boost I immediately purchased another for a tinkerboard.",2
5991,Prestige mixers are worst,"I bought this to store some photos and videos taken on one of my trips. I have other SD cards from Sandisk and they all worked fine for the same purpose, but this one keeps freezing even after the first click. If I want to do something as simple as opening a folder or renaming a file, I get that spinning colour wheel that shows the drive is stuck. I have been getting that from the second I started using it and it hasn't stopped even after ejecting, restarting the computer, etc. All other drives work absolutely fine. I am seriously unhappy, because even though it can store stuff, it's like pulling teeth to manage anything in there -- or to even OPEN any of the files.",1
5992,Worst product on Amazon,"i had a sandisk evo 128gb micro sd card and before i checked on the go-pro website i put it in my hero 7 white and it got stuck, the gopro worked but i could not get the card out as its slightly thicker than the sandisk extreme cards that gopro recommends but luckily after lots of presses and jiggling about i managed to remove the evo card without damage to the camera or card phew!!!!!, the sandisk extreme card fits easily and comes out easy so you want the best recommended card for your gopro get a SANDISK EXTREME CARD!!!!",1
5993,Don't buy,"Another amazing item from Sandisk.
I've had my eye on this for months and months to replace the 200GB Sandisk micro SD card I've had in my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 for the last 2 years. As soon as it dropped to less than £90 I had to buy it.

Transfer of data was done quickly and the card was seen with no problem by my phone.

The size is 400GB but don't expect to get that as useable storage.
Formed in Exfat I have 366.8GB.
This is not a frault card it's due to the way the space is allocated accross sectors and clusters on the device. An explanation is way beyond this review but believe me when I say it's fine.

Depending on the use such as using it on a linux system or if you know you won't have single files bigger than 4GB etc, you could increase the useable capacity slightly. If you're not sure then just leave it how it is.",2
5994,Very low plastic quality. Did not expect this type of worst quality from Prestige.,"Review of SanDisk Extreme 128 GB microSDXC Memory Card + SD Adapter with A2 App Performance + Rescue Pro Deluxe, Up to 160 MB/s, Class 10, UHS-I, U3, V30.
All works great, but it is not particularly clear that the headline claim of 160 MB/s seems to only be achievable with the specific SanDisk SDDR-B531-GN6NN MobileMate USB 3.0 Reader. Had to do a little digging to find this out.
With my generic USB 3.0 card reader I get about 94 MB/s, which is very good, but not the 160 MB/s I was initially expecting.
Put it in my Moto G5 phone and it's all good.",1
5995,Dont buy not good LOW QUALITY,"I bought this sd card for my phone having purchased one earlier from China very cheap it was supposed to be 512gb but only managed 2gb so a fake. I then bought this 128gb card from Amazon for a decent price and tested it in case it was a fake. The test results were 127.82gb capacity which was correct. The write speed was supposed to be 90MG/s correct speed 61MB/s. Read speed was supposed to be 160MB/s correct speed 81MB/s.
Although not the same as the claimed speed not bad for this type of card and the price paid, good enough to record high end recording.
So not a bad result from a Amazons supplier with a return guarantee till Jan 21 so forget China and pay the extra
and get a genuine item with a return clause. Please see results photos to verified test.",3
5996,Better buy from a local store.,"I bought this as an upgrade/replacement for the V10/U1 rated card that I mistakenly bought for my DJI Mavic Air 2 drone. you really do need a fast card for smooth video capture at higher frame rates and higher resolution (4k 120fps especially). Works just as well for photos, of course, but the card has made a huge difference to my video capture and feed stability. Well worth going for a brand with a good reputation, and few are as affordable as Sandisk while still having a great track record. I'm glad I paid a little bit more for this given the criticality with a DJI Mavic drone. I think at the moment 128gb is the sweet spot for price/memory ratio, and I don't foresee needing more for a while yet.",2
5997,Nice product 😊,"I bought my first digital camera in 2003 along with my first Sandisk memory card. I've stuck with them ever since and have never had a failure. I think I've probably bought about twenty over the years since then. Reliability is the most important thing with these. Speed is also important now we have cameras that record in 4K. I bought this to use with my DJI Pocket 2 camera that records 4K 60fps and needs this kind of higher performance memory card for smooth video. It works really well and is good value for the 128GB capacity. I still find it hard to believe you can get 128GB on such a tiny card.

You get an SD adapter in the pack so you can use the card in a regular card reader or other device that takes full-size SD cards.",4
5998,"Blades broke, lid won’t stay keeps popping - poorest quality grinder","I love these micro SD cards; and have purchased at least 20 of them over the last several years. I only use them for my cameras. When full I keep them as back ups of the photos I've taken. Until now I've never had an issue with them, however on returning from a month long Camps International adventure my daughter asked me to download the images from her water camera. She'd been swimming with dolphins and done other underwater activities, which she'd videoed using the water camera.

We've had 2 water cameras now and both have had a problem with respect to removing micro SD cards from the slot they usually reside in. It turned out that removing the card from the camera left the micro SD card (a 32 GB one) cracked. As it is a monolithic storage device, the data within the device has been lost forever.

We took it to a reputable recovery service, who checked it over and announced that it was beyond recovery. If we had been able to recover it, it would have cost around £500. Large cards would cost significantly more.

I'm happy with my cards, but never realised how fragile they were, which is why i've posted this here as a warning to anyone who uses micro SD cards. Keep them in proper storage cases and when removing them from your camera, be very careful.",1

Icons dropped off the screens. Device would freeze and crash. Refreshed install both devices twice before concluding these cards are not suitable for smartphone or tablets, mine anyway. I feel cheated because they are advertised as capable but they are not generically suitable for all unless others have experienced the same results from using these cards. I have got some other manufacturers cards and so far so good no freezes, crashes and no disappearing shortcut icons off home windows.",3
6000,A defective product for all... Read all reviews,"The MicroSD card works as expected although it's too slow for running Android apps from it (through Adoptable Storage) despite the claim in the description that it's suitable for apps. Some apps do run perfectly fine from the MicroSD card, but many others are slower to load or have performance issues that don't exist when saved on the phone's internal storage.

I would suggest making sure that your phone has enough internal storage for apps in the first place, rather than relying on expandable storage like MicroSD cards on Android. They're just not fast enough and are more suited to streaming service downloads and photos than they are for apps.",1
6001,Worthless purchase ..!,Bought 2 64gb cards for my new DJI FPV drone saved £3 each by buying cards out of packaging for £9.99 a piece instead of £12.99 a piece.

6003,Defective product,"After buying a Nextbase Camera the instructions given in the booklet did not mention anything of a U3 card. Nextbase 64gb cost close to £50+ each. Ridiculous price in my opinion. Found these Sandisks for just £25 at the time so I bought 2 of them.
ALSO for those looking at Nextbase if you use a rear camera a 30gb only holds about 60 minutes of recording time. So if you intend any long drive You want these Sandisks which can save up to approx 60 hours worth of video and it works with Nextbase requirements too.",1
6004,Good Mixer Grinder with noise.,"Bought for my new drone, I went for this one for immediate delivery via Prime and because it had an appropriate speed rating. Realistically U3 is required for high speed video, and 64Gb is perfectly suited to 30 minutes of flying time in higher resolution. I have found the footage a bit jerky, but to be fair that is probably down to the performance of the drone camera rather than this card. The price was OK, not the cheapest by any means, but next day delivery made it a good option. The fact if comes with an adaptor is a nice bonus, meaning I can upload footage to my laptop easily after filming.

A decent memory card, I'll probably test it in my GoPro to compare the footage.",4

I also got the 128 gb extreme a2 which I had no problems with. Though the Htc 10 reads the card storage a little higher it is not a problem. A2 is a new technology made by sandisk and western digital. You can buy cheaper but you get limited use and eventually the card loses the ability to write onto or be formatted, though leaving it as unencrpted on the Htc 10.

Though many people use online music but off line music, films and books is nice to have. Also I use extreme cards in my car cams and they are still working after months of use.",1
6010,Poor service from Prestige,"Bought it to use as extended memory space on my Nintendo switch, it’s easy to install, responde well.
Nice size and not too expensive.",1
6011,pathetic product... dont buy you will regret later.,"I bought this specifically for the GoPro Hero 8 Black (it's on the official website as being compatible). I've unfortunately not had a chance to do any speed tests yet, but I've had zero problems with it so far.

I recorded a ton of clips at 4K at 60 FPS and I've not had any recording problems yet. It might not be the quickest card on the market, but it's a good price and a good fit for a 4K action camera.",1

6013,Not happy although quality is good,"Using a relatively old Toshiba chromebook means storage is always an issue. Wanted to have offline access to some videos and I wanted a simple and small permanent storage solution. This card ticketed my boxes in regards to capacity, storage space and cost.
Simple and effective, fast enough and working without issues (been using it a couple of months) so far. Would recommend.",3
6014,All in One,"I bought this for use in a GoPro 9. Today I got an SD card error message and all data has been lost. That’s all photos and videos from the last two weekends gone, just like that!

I bought SanDisk as I thought it would be more reliable than some nondescript crap from eBay but I’ve ended up in the same place.

Even after admitting that the data has gone, formatting the card still leaves it unreadable by my GoPro and my laptop reaffirming suspicions that the card is faulty.

One very disappointed customer, what a waste of money!",5
6015,Very Wonderful Product,"well I've gone & purchased a new drone so I'm needing a good quality memory card, this brand was mentioned by several online drone flyers so I've given it a shot. & upto now I'm not disappointed.. currently no issues running this card & capturing 4K video (my drone is the Mavic Air 2) so its got alot of bells & whistles going for it..
anyway reading & transferring files ""large files"" is straight forward & fast for the size/data being transferred. video quality is excellent so no writing issues noticed. So for now I'm happy I'll update my review if any issues are found with corresponding dates etc for any update.",5
6016,Disappointed with Prestige Brand and Amazon,"I have been using SanDisk products for over 20 years. Up until recently they have been fantastic. However, I am deeply concerned about 3 recent purchases as I believe they may be fake SanDisk products. Okay, I know Amazon cannot check every item it sells. But at the end of 2020 I bought a SanDisk 250gb micro SD card for a not insignificant sum of money. I used the card for the first time last week on holiday. Unfortunately the card is (intermittently) defective. In other words, some video footage is great and other footage is completely unusable. (And because its beyond the 30 day period Amazon have referred me to the manufacturer.)

On Monday - Prime Sale - I bought 2 SanDisk 64gb micro SD cards. Both are defective. GRRRRR. Although they will record video (in my case using an action camera), when you try to upload the videos to a computer it wont recognise the card, let alone read the video content. When I examined the defective cards in more detail I noticed the colour scheme was different to the other 20+ SanDisk cards that I own (and which work fine). So...either SanDisk has let the ball drop, or Amazon is unknowingly sourcing and selling fake and/or defective SanDisk products. NOT AMUSED!!!!!!",2
6017,Speed Control Stopped working within 8 days of Usage,"As usual, the package arrived very quickly from Amazon.

This Micro SD Card arrived in a blister pack.

I now always use this make of Micro SD card as I find they work really well with my Action Camera, I haven't had one fail yet. Also they are perfect when I am recording in 4K, the transfer rate it faster than some other cards I have tried.

I would recommend this SanDisk Extreme 128 GB MicroSDSXC Memory Card

I hope you have found this review an helpful.",1
6018,Switch failure and defective mixy.,"La velocidad de escritura es muy buena, la capacidad es real y a pesar de que el color 'amarillo' de la memoria se ve más verde que nada, el producto es real y auténtico. Utilizado en GoPro 6 sin problemas (2.20Hrs en 4K a 60fps).",3
6019,Writing this after using 1.5 years,"I’ve always bought SanDisk and found their memory cards to be fast, effective and reliable. Or so I thought... I bought this extreme 128gb for my new GoPro 9, formatted it in the camera as recommended and started using it. It was ok for a while then the camera advised me of a card fault, so I couldn’t continue to take shots or view the videos or photos I’d already taken. I had to reformat it, losing my files. I tried again, with the same result. A friend advised me to try a full format on my computer, which I thought had fixed it, but alas not! I’m just glad that the error didn’t occur when I was scuba diving and unable to take underwater shots. Unfortunately I can’t now return it as I’m past the return date by a few days.",1
6020,Bad product. Amazon selling banned product. Buyer beware,"Compre esta micro sd para usarla en mi nuevo nintendo switch comprado en el buen fin, y pues en cuanto a la marca Sandisk no hay mucho que decir, solo basta mencionar que es líder en la fabricación de este tipo de memorias, cabe recalcar que no son baratas pero si uno espera pacientemente a la temporada de rebajas puede uno adquirirla muy buen precio. Esta micro sd me salio en 615 pesos, con 190mb/s de escritura y 90mb/s de lectura, lo que la hace ideal para grabar en 4k y con especificaciones de sobra para el nintendo switch.

El envió fue de importación y me llego a través de DHL sin ningún contratiempo y días antes de la fecha máxima de entrega. Muy contento con la compra.",1
6021,Very poor quality sub-standard product from Prestige,"Having bought a couple of Samsung Micro SD cards in the past 3 months both of which have failed, I decided to try a SanDisk card instead. They have great reliability reviews online but I have always thought them to be on the expensive side.

Experience has now shown me that sometimes it's better to spend a little more for better reliability. There is even a free downloadable rescue app, which I hope I'll never need but very useful to have. Performance in my action camera was much better than expected. These were on a great offer so I took the plunge.",1
6022,I have received used product multuple scratching on jar and black spot on plug.,"Die SD Karte hält bei mir bisher durchaus was sie verspricht.

Sowohl Lese- als auch Schreibgeschwindigkeit liegt bisher über den Werten, mit welchen die Karte beworben wird. Insbesondere die Schreibgeschwindigkeit ist beeindruckend hoch. Gemessen wurde das Ganze am USB3.1 Port mit einem Sandisk USB Adapter. Wie auch bei den Speichermedien anderer Hersteller kann ich feststellen, dass bei größeren Kapazitäten die Schreibgeschwindigkeit augenscheinlich höher ist als bei geringen Mediengrößen.

Ich habe zum Beispiel auch zwei USB 3.1 Sticks von Samsung getestet und auch hier ist der kleine Stick langsamer.

Verwendet wird die Karte in einer Gopro Hero 7 Black für die Aufzeichnung von 4k/60fps Videodaten. Bisher hat mich die Karte noch nicht in Stich gelassen und, sollte es bei den getesteten Werten bleiben, rechne ich auch nicht damit, dass es mal dazu kommen könnte.",2
6023,Five Stars,"Had issues with the first one they sent me, always needed formatting, finally got some analysis software and found ""track 0 bad"" errors, had to return it, had it returned and a new one shipped in the same day (which was nice), support are great to talk to as well.

The 2nd one they have given has proven its salt, its got great speeds reducing loading times on my switch and I look forward to installing alot of games on it no issues with the new one unlike the last.

be warned formatting takes about 1-3 hours depending due to the sheer size of the card and your pc haha",5
6024,Don't buy. Too much noise and blades weren't sharpened!,"I knew the spec said it was fast, but unless your used to 'fast' you don't really know what to expect, so when I put it in my phone it was instantly picked up, and automatically moved the photo's storage to itself, now I wanted to get some pictures off my phone, so when I connected via a cable and started to move them to my PC, they flew across, fastest card I have ever had, as I don't have the money to get the more expensive ones, in fact this one was a stretch for me, but very glad I did. :)",1
6025,WORST PRODUCT FROM PRESTIGE.,"This is a great piece of investment. A very convenient, handy piece of storage, on the go. A must buy if storing demanding and valuable data is your thing.",1

This is usually thievery, no one reacts to it
Speed is MUCH lower than advertised.. Tested read is 21.46MB/s and Write is 21.07MB/s
Do not buy as it can be easily dead anytime because of bad quality. It's either fake or counterfeit",1
6029,"Pooooor, worst, bad product.","I previously had a lower grade SanDisk Ultra microsd card fail on me in my mobile phone and I lost a lot of precious photographs which were unrecoverable unfortunately. I have since upgraded to the Extreme range which gives me a little more peace of mind, and I have not had any issues yet, however I also set my phone to automatically backup to cloud storage now, as I wouldn't want to risk such a loss of data again.",1
6030,Very Bad performance,"Ordered one of these cards in 400G on Amazons limited deals which I couldn't pass up. Unfortunately the first card was completely d.o.a. The card couldn't be seen, neither as a standard card or with the adapter provided, even checked using other readers and adapters but no luck. Chkdsk couldn't see it at all and it would hang up some other devices I used to test. It was annoying but these things happen.
Amazon were very quick to organize and send a replacement which arrived two days later. Second card worked perfectly so all was good and with limited inconvenience.",1
6031,Waste product in Amazon I didn't expect in this Amazon like this products are sold,"I have used Sandisk products for years, storing, writing and transferring terabytes of data to these cards and have not have one fail on me. The Sandisk Extreme is no exception. I am currently using this card in my GoPro Hero 9 Black and I have not experienced any issues with it, no corruption, quick transfer speeds and plenty of storage for your money.

If you're looking for a micro SD Card, look no further. This is the card you want.",3
6032,Don't waste your money,"I was in doubt weather this would work both for a Dash cam, action cam and my DSLR camera that shoots 4K video and is able to shoot slowmotion up to 180fps and can shoot 10bit 4:2:2 internally.
I have not had any problems so far.

You get the micro SD card for the dash cam and action cam, and included you get an adapter, to adapt to your DSLR camera.

I will recommend this card for anyone who needs both a micro and normal SD memory card.",1
6033,"MIxer grinder Good, Juicer Total waste of money","I purchased 2 SanDisk Extreme 64GB micro SD cards and they appear reliable and perform well. I've never bothered running any performance tests or checked the capacity. The criteria I use is based on price and reliability, who cares if they have a little less capacity or slower than advertised.

I purchase memory cards on a regular basis with no loyalty to any particular brand. Like many others, the SanDisk range of cards perform well but I only purchase items that are Sold by Amazon and never purchase from 3rd party sellers.",3
6034,High Noise Item,"This memory card was bought to work with my digital camera with 4K video and post-focus capability. It had to be fast and big - which this one is. The price was right too. It's performing well in the camera and writes images very quickly. If you buy one, which I recommend, make sure you have a good quality up-to-date SD adapter for it.",4
6035,Only good for painting walls.,Bought specifically for GoPro Hero 7 Black. The best card for this camera in my opinion as it doesn't cause the camera to freeze like other cards do. Got this in the Prime deals in July for about a tenner so I was very happy with the price.,2
6036,Good product at good price ...!,"I bought a go pro Hero6 and wanted to do some long videos on it without having to change cards. I opted for this San Disk 512GB micro SD card. It's awesome, super fast. I formatted it in the camera in about 15seconds. Even when saving a 1 hour long video it only takes a few seconds to save it to the card. Transfer rates are fast to when copying files to my Mac. Highly recommended if you can buy it at the sale price too.",5
6037,Very very very bad,"I ordered this for my Neewer 4k Action cam which I use as a dashcam. The Micro SD card I had wasn't an Extreme one, it was a standard old one. Although it worked it couldn't keep up with even 1080p recording, let alone 4k, so would freeze every 2 seconds or so. That is obviously no good for a dashcam as the freeze would last around 5 frames and could miss something crucial. 5 frames doesn't sound like much but when travelling at 30 mph or above, 5 frames is a lot. So I ordered this one and it now records effortlessly in 1080p AND 4k without a problem! Happy dappy days :)",1
6038,Horrible Experience,"I bought this SD card about 2 months ago for my GoPro Hero 9 Black. Everything was all good until around 3 weeks ago when I got the dreaded “SD Card Error” message. Now I have to format the SD card at least twice a week and now I’m replacing it with another brand. I had this issue with the 64GB SanDisk card, but it was a few years old so I figured it would be because it was used so much. If you buy this SD card make sure you backup all data you’d like to keep the same day so you don’t lose footage. I’ve contacted GoPro and they have assured me it’s not a software issue on their end as my GoPro is updated monthly.",1
6039,"Average product, Worst service - Go for other Mixers","Have used Sandisk SD cards for years as they last the longest and have great performance

Bought a 64GB Sandisk Extreme microSDXC card (A2) and enjoyed 3MB's write speed over three days of use before it corrupted.

I've received a replacement from the same seller and its only giving me 2MB's write speed so we shall see how long it lasts. Will update this review based on those results.",1
6040,Just go for it,Unfortunately there are a LOT of fake SD cards on the market at the minute making it s mine field to buy them from anyone except direct from the manufacturer. I can only speak for the one I bought but the write and read speeds were spot on and I confirmed the total memory size to be 121GB using h2testw. It's rare for even a genuine card to have the full advertised memory size so the missing 7GB was not unusual so my personal opinion is that it was a genuine card.,5
6041,Absolute ridiculous Product..,"Bought for the nintendo switch as we quickly ran out of space with our 128GB. This was on offer so it was a great buy and works like a charm (side note if you buy for the same reason - format this on the switch and redownload all the games as save data is on the switch - wasted so much time trying to transfer and it doesnt work propperly).

All in all a great card",1
6042,"To be avoided, DONT BUY","There are two brands of memory card I trust and buy - one is SanDisk.

I use a variety of cameras ranging from top pro cameras to VLOG style POV cameras such as this Feiyu-tech Pocket.

Filming in 4K is very demanding on a memory card as the data rates are high. You need a card that is capable of recording that data, and the SanDisk Extreme range is one of those cards!

I bought this card a while ago and don't believe always in instant reviews because they are not always accurate. Several months on, this card is still performing as it should giving me no problems transferring the data to hard drive or any file corruption issues.

A good quality, reliable card!",1
6043,Low grade plastic.,"I bought this card to use with a gopro. I had bought a Kingston card but found after 17mins the camera stopped recording. I researched the read/write speeds and identified this card should fit the bill. So far, I have not been disappointed. The first time I used the card my GoPro ran for 4hours (With an external battery) and the card performed as it should with out any issues what so ever. Having used it twice now for long file recordings and every time faultlessly. If I needed an additional card, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this again. Added to I received speedy service and delivery. Thank you to all concerned.",1
6044,Cheap build. Stopped working in 9 months of lite use.,"The price of this card on sale at about £80 made it an easy decision. The speed is very high and it meant than transferring roughly 100gb of files to it took very little time. Using it for high mp photos and 4k video, I don't see any lag.",1
6045,Unexpected buying experience from Prestige and Amazon,"I swear by scan disk and have never had a problem. However with this supplier, they've not made it clear on the class as this is below a class 6. I needed this for a dash cam what has the additional rearview camera to be fitted. Now if you're wondering how found this out. The dash cam which had a smaller size memory that was class 8 memory card worked until switching the memory cards. So now have to switch to ultra. Little let down, would like this to be stated clearly.",1
6046,Mixer regulator problem.,"So I took my car on trackday recently and the footage appeared choppy and broken in the morning. I switched to the SD Card which the GoPro came with and this was fixed immediately.

Annoyingly this SD Card is on the list of approved cards on the GoPro page so I thought I'd be ok - but its not... I tried changing my media file viewer and still the same problem, also worth noting I'm on a decent laptop too.",1
6047,Quality of product is delivered as promised,"Just what I needed. I had a 32 gb card for my go pro hero 4 silver, and decided I wanted a little bit more storage space so I had the flexibility when recording. 128 gb will do perfectly for what I'll need it for. Next up, an external hardrive!",5
6048,"Very bad, please don't buy.","UPDATE:
Used in another device & PC, definitely faulty! Card error! Will be destroying to make sure no data is stored

I have had to replace 1 in 12 months it somehow became corrupted and would not install a thing. So the second I took the insurance on. I brought a 3rd for the same purpose a spare odroid go advance.
Is give these an 80% for reliability.",1
6050,Plz don't buy.,"I paid extra for this Extreme card to get better transfer performance over my Ultra cards. When transferring files with my 2018 Transcend USB 3.0 reader I noticed it was slower than my Ultra card (around 80 MB/s). I queried Sandisk, who were very helpful, and said it was due to the reader. I needed a SanDisk SDDR-B531 reader to ensure high performance. You need to ensure your card reader supports the A2 protocol, and my Transcend reader didn't.",1
6051,Great customer support,"This card is great, but one thing is to be kept in mind.
It is really sensitive. I literally broke it when grabbed my Raspberry Pi Zero W by card slot (when it was in).
It just cracked as crisp and all data gone.
It looks one side of the card is stronger, but other one is not. Bending card one side is pretty safe - you need to use lots of force to brake it. But when you try to bent it on other side - its cracking easily. Too easy IMHO.",5
6052,WORST QUALITY OF PRODUCT AND RUBBISH QUALITY CHECK BY THE MANUFACTURER,"No complaints to share as it does what it is intended to do. I haven't had to worry about it failing so far (now there's tempting fate). It is reasonably fast in modern devices and writes fast enough for the camera body it's in. I can get another shot or two per second with a fast lens compared to slower cards, which is why I bought it.

I would probably buy another (or a more recent Sandisk offering) if I felt the need.",1
6053,poor built and quality,"PLEASE NOTE: This is not compatible with the Viofo A129 Dash Cam. It is too powerful. Instead, buy a less powerful microSD.

I've used this card several times now, and have not experienced similar issues.

However, these memory cards are certainly a worthwhile purchase.",2
6057,"Design fault, and bad plastic and bad material. So poor quality materials","I ordered these cards with a single purpose, I needed really fast cards without putting a hole in my pocket and I could have compromised a little on advertised vs actual storage space.

I'm very satisfied with its juicer grinder, perfect grinding with filters. Although less noise level is the main plus point of this mixer grinder
But the juicer grinder is made up with plastic (not think it is premium), not sure with cracking
Best product at this price range

6078,Performance issue / worst experience/ not satisfied,"I am very happy to invest my money in this machine it's quality is more than excellent.
And it is very powerful machine under this segment with 4 unit of jar. I have made peanut butter in the mixy and the result is more than my expectations..
If you want to make powder of some SAABUT MASALE then go for it.
Very useful for this. And it makes juice also of very good quality.
Very powerful motor....love it.
Just purchase it without extra thinking about it..
Everything everything everything...is excellent about this product..
Very satisfied..",1
6079,Worst product of Prestige.,"Not goes with prestige of 'prestige' brand, don't grind to fineness. Makes harsh and loud sound. Also price is too high.",2
6080,I need explain,"Review after 3months of continuous use,almost every day. For a family of 5 this machine is smooth and powerful.
Have different varieties of jar with a juicer also.
Some parts in juicer I feel not so user friendly but the amount paid makes worth of it.

If you are thinking a budgeted grinder or a mixer then you should go for it.

And don't get confused this with a food processor.

Thums up for this product.",4
6081,Worst mixer grinder ever! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.,"Can't even make a banana shake. Poor cutting action. Very bad product. Writing after using for 2 years. No use of 750w power if the product can't churn milk properly. Juicer jar is OK but pretty much useless. I recently purchased Crompton Ameo. For the same price, Crompton is many times better with premium quality, big strong jars, transparent lids and better grinding performance. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product. For same price Crompton Ameo is a much better buy.
Update after 2 year very minor usage. The mixer coupler only has single element left with rest broken. Very poor quality material.",1
6082,Worth for money but huge noise,"I was not confident of buying a cheaper brand, but was fed up of the expensive food processors giving so much problems.
Buying the prestige mixer grinder was one of my best decisions s.
It is heavy duty, being 750 watts, so all my dosa and idli batter gets grounded perfectly.
My dry masalas need very little grinding, and turn out fine.
The only problem is that we need a few trials to figure out the ideal jar for each function....means coconut chutney can be ground only in the middle jar and so on.
This is the best kitchen aid I have bought in many years. Easy to use, easy to maintain, powerful and strong. Value for money.",3
6083,Poor quality i had seen,Instable product quality. Stopped working just in a span of 20 days. get repaired once from service center but gain got the same problem repeatedly.,1
6084,Worst Customer Service ever,"I had bought this machine in Aug 2019. Within one month, we had a visit from Prestige technician as the machine stopped working completly. As I write this review the machine is again not working and had to lodge a second complaint. Are Indian manufacturers like Prestige serious about quality!! I think not!! Last but not the least, this is a entry level 750 watt machine, strongly recommend a buy against any Prestige product, especially in which they do not have core comptence. They traditionally have been in pressure cookers and cookware, that is what they are fine with. Mixers/ grinders, chimneys, coffee makers, blenders etc is not Thier competence, a definite avoid for Prestige as a brand in these areas",1
6085,Waste,Nice mixer grinder but the burning smells come out when u start grinding or mixing same as shown in pic,2
6086,Pathetic,"*The brand name itself says ""prestige""it really keep product in the kitchen
*Starting plastic smell is there but don't panic when the product comes in daily use. This smell vanished out . But still I recommend that please read the instructions that how to use initially.
.Powerful mixer that I never seen , it is replacement of my Bajaj mixer and I never miss that mixer because how efficiently the prestige iris working smoothly.
Cons
Instead of plastic cap it should be stainless steel otherwise product is very good.",1
6087,Grinders get Jammed - because of rust,This mixer is not designed well. It doesn’t grind material well. The jar internal size and the blade placing distance from bottom inner surface etc. Not happy with the product at all,2
6088,Very bad product and worst service,Very noisy.. Almost all d jars are leaking.. The jar doesn't gets locked to the machine.. Its very dangerous.. Anything can happn becoz of its loose fitting.. I need my money back.. Not a worthy product to say.. D small jar is utter waste doesn't graind anything,1
6089,Horribly noisy,"This piece of engineering by prestige is annoying/useless/waste of money. It makes loud noise. But this isn't the frustrating part,it's the red button at the bottom. This machine gets tierd after 30 seconds of running and wants complete day rest after that. Every time you try to use it the button push back and then the reset game starts.
I used it once and missed the return window now my 2800 is down the drain as this shit doesn't work and amazon is still listing this as amazon choice. I have no idea why?",2
6090,Please send product after inspection in future,Very nice and powerful mixture for daily use. In my house it particularly use for grinding rice for some ceremony like 'Pithe' in Bengali. But after using 9-10 times it work well but I agree with the fact that material quality is average and even not too good but if someone Handel with care it work good and last long life.,1
6091,Cocophony,"Updated 12/08/2018: returned the item and had to order a new one. This time it seems working fine but still I feel the built quality is not to the standards.
Jars guage and quality is not that great. Motor capacity is good.
Just received the product today. As soon as I opened the box, pulled the main body out and surprisingly it started making sound as there were some loose parts inside. Now I am doubting the quality and genuinity of the product . Even the guy who was packing could have observed the sound and kept it away, but it didn't happen. I am trying to contact the seller but no luck , no channel to contact them on this issue.
I don't find a way to contact seller about this issue. Return is the only option? So crazy. Waste of time hhhuh.",1
6092,Worth it,"Worth the price! And i bought it on discount too so extra advantage . Works perfectly . My mom loves it , so goooood. Easy to handle and clean and its powerful.
There are 4 jars and this type usually costs 6000 plus rs outside in electronic shops , but this best among all.
Don’t think twice go for it .",5
6093,Broke with in a month,"Broken in one month. Not sure in covid days customers are getting defective products as we cannot question not we can go near to a service agency. One more time I want to write a feedback here, as I am suffering hell. Dont buy this product, the blades got broken, the platic rotators or I dont know what is that called, the improtant part of mixer got broken into pieces while rotating. Over all its a crap and waste of money....... Very unfortunate that amazon is accepting such display. And one more thing , it doesnt grinds properly, the dosa or chutney is always 90% grinded......you can never grind as per requirement in general.",1
6094,"Machine not working, detective piece",I am writing this review after using this product for 2 months. One fine morning while running the mixer there was a big sound and all of sudden fire flames from the product. This completely damaged the body as you can see in the pics. I raised this issue with the customer service centre about 10 days back and still no resolution. There has been no visit by any technician to check the product or what went wrong here.,1
6095,"Substandard product, designed to fool the customer!","The build quality is not the best in the market. The plastics used in the mixer makes you feel it as of below average quality but not the worst. I got this for ₹2,973. For this price you are getting features like a Juicer Jar and an extra mixer jar. So cannot complain much. Considering the price, you are getting good product. Buy this only if you compromise on the build quality and want the extra jar and juicer.

I have given four stars because of the below average build quality. Meanwhile none of the body/part/jar has broken till now. Everything is fine. But they may break if used roughly.

If build quality is the highest priority, then it is not for you..",1
6096,Overall quality of the product,When I went to the thorough research in Google or in you tube I found this product finally and Amazon offering it in best price and in offer of discount too.... After receiving the product I could feel the class and look and the quality... But for each and every product there is a bad review but I thought to give a try it's really cool one... No worries whatever it is Amazon will help with in the return window... After that we can claim warranty.... So based on that thought I purchased this one... Really a cool one people.. just buy this one if you really loves it...,3
6097,Prestige do not recognise online sales on AMAZON. They claim it to be fake.,"Bought this for 3,463₹ a week ago. It's a good mixer grinder. Good capacity of all the jar. But the blades are very low. And not the sharpest. Therefore it takes longer to grind stuff. That's a big minus point. There are better mixer grinder in same price . I am sure. While I was searching, I found that in comparison from others, more people have bought this particular one. I don't know if they are also facing the same problem. I wouldn't say, it's bad but it's neither best. The blades must have been sharper.",1
6098,It's nt working within 2 months of purchase. Highly disappointed,"I am using it for about an year. The noise is unbearable. If you start the mixer at night, it will definitely scare the people around you. One time the plastic couplers in the jar and motor joined together with the heat produced. I had to use some tools to remove the jar from the motor. The material quality is very poor. The grinding is also very poor. The blades are of no use. I bought this product since it was a product of prestige which I believed makes quality products. Within a year I had to replace a bush and 3 plastic couplers . Terrible product. Please don't buy.",1
6099,Very waste product of prestigious prestige product... Not worth for -(negative) rating also,"Product is good, but motor sound is unbearable. While purchasing the mixer they mentioned in the description that sound is 80-90 percent low I believe. But when I started to use motor sound was very high and unbearable. I think motor is not in good condition or not a good quality. Later on when I checked with TTK they said it is 750 watts heavy duty motor and sound will be there for some days.later on it will decrease",1
6100,Switch broke within 6 months,"I am giving the revive after 1 month

6101,Recommended for Daily Use,"On the same day when it was delivered the it ran for a while when i was using it for first time, but in between it stopped and didn't turn on since.
It couldn't even handle blending of tomatoes then I don't know what it is meant for. Pathetic product from Prestige.",4
6102,Satisfied but not fully,"Been using it for over 3 months and I will admit that it has made my life really easy. I usually prepare food at home and take to office for health reasons and this mixie sets caters to all my needs.

It has a juicer with strainer, wet grinder, dry grinder and a chutney grinder. All of them work very well. A little noisy but I am satisfied as I have faced no issues till now.",4
6103,Not very satisfactory,"Bought the product. It was faulty. Too much noise since some parts were faulty. Requested a return but they only had replacement option. Got a replacement product. Within a month same problem started again (we are just two people in the house so usage is to that extent)
Now I don't have an option to return or replace.
Every penny spent on this item wasted.
Will have to get a new one.",1
6104,Replacement of Prestige mixer,"We use prestige kitchen ware mostly in kitchen. Gas stove, induction cooktop, cookware etc. They work well. So I ordered this mixer. The performance is not at all upto the mark of prestige products . Generally prestige products work well with no complaints. But this is not at all grinding well. Probably the other model may work well. But I have not tried. I returned this product and got another one of different brand from a retailer.",1
6105,DO NOT BUY anything from Prestige ever.,"This product Amazon promotes like anything in every sale. this product you'll see at a very attractive price but it's not at all worth for as lowest you can pay for.

The build quality is just worst. First I ignored it and thought of not judging it too soon by just the build and use it anyway just because it has 750wt powerful motor at a decent price. But I regret not returning it and going for some another brand.

Previously i was using philips mixer 450watt one which is still there just beside this new trash just to fill the need whenever this newly bought 750watt noob motor decide to turn off even though not running on much of a load.

Hope after reading this review at least some people won't do the mistake i did by buying this.",1
6106,Faulty prestige mixer grinder.,"Don't buy this mixer. It is not worth wasting even a single rupee on it. Given it was available on sale, it could be expected that some parts are cheap. But cutting costs at the locking mechanism of the motor to the vessel that is used to grind is definitely un-expected. The specifications say that the motor will not start if the vessel is not locked correctly, that did not work as expected. The motor started and the locking mechanism right now is damaged.",1
6107,Worst blades and Jars,"Jars are not in good function. Don't send this type of products. We thought that the product was good. We are not satisfied with the product you send us. After using for a week, the oil is coming out from jars. Dear team don't entertaining this type of products. So what can be done with this product? Give us clarification regarding the issue we faced on this product or give us a call and then we will respond you.",1
6108,DONT BUY THIS!,"I purchased this during the recent Amazon sale. Price was pretty cheap after the 10% discount on credit card payment. I believe this product cost me approximately 2,500 rupees.

When we un-packaged the product, we noticed food particles sticking in 2 grinder jars. Someone had returned the product previously. We decided to retain it as there was no visible damage. However, the mixer grinder that we received makes a very loud shrill sound that is unbearable to the ears. And the blade on the grinder on which the jars fit has also come off.

I had a smaller mixer grinder previously where the jar is placed upside down on the grinder. That way the grinding is executed really well. Using this Prestige grinder, I've tried making almond and coconut milk and banana and mango shake. The grinding is not that good. Big chunks of banana and mango are there in the shake despite running the grinder for longer than usual.

I would not recommend this mixer grinder.",1
6109,Long lasting mixer,"The Blades are extremely blunt, doesn’t purée tomatoes or mint chutney. Chunks are left in whatever you try to grind! Ordered a replacement of the jar thinking might b a problem with one unit, the replacement sent is the same, Useless. The Juicer can be used for only soft fruits so you have to be careful in selection or the blades break off 🙄 Happened with me!
Customer Service is pathetic, they don’t have a home service option for this particular product.
I usually don’t write reviews but this product instigated me to write! Please don’t buy this product.",5
6110,Such things lacks interest in buying online,"Delivers more than what promised. An asset in the kitchen.
The first thing we used it for was to grind a garam masala mix from whole spices - large cardamom to bay leaf. The grinder did it in less than 90 secs and more effectively than the normal standard mixer/grinder.",2
6111,Good value for money.,I like this product I am happy to use this but I have a face the problem with noise no not at all any mixer grinder can do the noise it's not a big problem so great but I have a problem with cash on delivery because we select when we selected cash on delivery mode but the delivery boys are asking you have Google pay aur net banking that is also a problem coming to the first point the north level is high coming to the second point the product quality is great third some was not work well but its work well I like the product my old mixi also Prestige company only with call to 750 watt power coming to the blades blades are very shark about coming to the package I have great package and the caps was so so nice and tight we don't have to keep hand on the mixer when the mixer what grinding I have a great quality on this product coming to the blades blades are very shark and coming to the branded warranty they have given one year warranty coming to the main part is 750 what it's doing the power as possible from 750 watt this is the genuine review I have given the reviews for all my six product in this year so I think that online shopping is greater than outside buying I gave five start Amazon but I have a problem I didn't get cash on delivery mode in all products thank you valuable for money,1
6112,Powerful,"The product was good until it stopped working after 6 months. Has been using for a small family, so not much continuous usage, still it stopped responding within a short period of time. Moreover, the manufacturer will not repair the product under warranty since the invoice doesn't have the serial number of the product.

Since amazon delivers the product without opening the product, there is no way amazon could add serial number on the invoices, but not sure why the manufacturers demanding the serial number on the invoices.",4
6113,Pathetic experience...I doubt its original Philips,"Very plasticky jars. The small jar does not fit properly and whenever the mixy is run it gives out the smell of burning or the smell of something wrong happening inside the machine. Every time I operate it it gives the feeling as if it is the last time.
We are not ble to use the small jar as whenever it is used some smoke comes out of the mixer. Our previous mixer Sumeet created a record of running for around 20 years. This One I think will create a record of not even running for 20 months.",1
6114,Amazing Amazon Sale...!!!! Got Prestige Iris 750 Watt Mixer Grinder within 8hrs of ordering.,I trusted Brand name and that was my mistake!! Earlier I have used unknown brand but product working better than PRESTIGE.... this mixer grinder is useful... 750 watt but not getting fine grinding at all. So I suggest don't go with the brand mixer grinder... 1200-1500/- mixer grinder work better than PRESTIGE 3000/- mixer grinder. I have started using late otherwise I could go for refund!!,5
6115,Nice product n quality is Ok,"Sounds just like every other mixer juicer.
Works very well.
Good material and durable, if you are not dropping it on a regular basis🤷🏻‍♂️. Just needs some normal handling and care and it will go on with you for a long time.
Powerful and looks normal like every other kitchenware stuff.",4
6116,Perfect product with good delivery,"The product didn't meet our expectations. It was a horrible experience. There was an odd high pitch sound in the beginning and within a month, the product broke down. More than that, the prestige company declined any request to replace or refund such a defective product that broke down in a couple of months. Their handling of the issue was too unprofessional, asking me to accept just a repair or nothing. Totally bad experience",5
6117,Duplicate low quality product delieverd,"Some highlighted features of this product:-
👉Wattage: 750 W; Voltage: 230 V; Revolution: 20000 RPM

6118,Don't buy Prestige items which doesn't have service backup,"Noise level is so high and 3 jars fit properly but small jar fit loose in it. It was of no use. And the piece was not a fresh one maybe it's a show piece or something like that it's used one..
I put for return and I got my refund.

My sincere request to all don't ever purchase some products like electronics in online. Prefer to buy in stores.
Even though price is low when compared to stores.",1
6119,Good product but packaging was not so good.,"Not a perfect product, not working within 15 days of purchase after return policy expired. Some black oil is coming in all chutneys and batters. and it never stopped and finally yesterday smoke came out of it and stopped working and every usage some smell came out of it like burning of wires.

Called customer care and technician have visited the house in a day and was saying that complete motor burned out and after 2 days he came with new motor and replaced with the burned one expect outer plastic part complete inside motor have been replaced.
Finally it is working condition now.
Will add my experience again after using it for some more days",4
6120,Poor quality parts - reduced life of mixer,"Guys don’t buy this product, I bought this and after two months the coupler broken and cracks all over the body, And the noice is very high compared to other mixers, Prestige not ready to replace the product and when I went for service there same product lying for different issues, who will buy a mixer for 2 months!? Even my old mixer still working with less noice than prestige iris 750, that too 7 years old, Never recommended this product and please don’t buy from prestige… their customer support team also not behaving if u raise the issue just tell us to go to the service Centre that’s it… this is my genuine review , and don’t be fooled buying this product",2
6121,Worst ever product,"Either my wife is grating rocks in the mixer or this is a true piece of junk. The fuse.or something keept going off.

The knob is flimsy and was changed in the first visit.

Second visit the technician changed some fuse now put in a request for 3rd visit 6 months down the lane for bush replacement

Pros the waranty and service some.one comes in 24 hours and fixes the problem once reported

Cons the product is flimsy but the service is ok

Either ways it's a junk caz even if my wife is grating rocks philips mixer never gave me any issues which we used for years together.",1
6122,Bad product received,"We are very disappointed by this Prestige mixer grinder , when we use it for grinding dosa or idli batter it takes too long, we have to keep doing it again and again to get the right consistency. We bought it on October 18th 2019 and it stopped working yesterday. We are so fed up with it that We have bought a new philips mixer grinder today 23rd January 2021. Unnecessary waste of money and terrible experience of using Prestige mixer grinder. As a loyal and prime customer of Amazon I hope some corrective action is taken.",2
6123,Best for kitchen items.,"I bought this product in the month of NOV 2020 and was using from them.here is my review

1) Noise level is too high. Even neighbors who are approx 50 to 100m apart from my house can hear the sound of the grinder. At night neighbors shall shout if we use the grinder.Such is the noise level

2) Leekage from all the jar. After multiple complaints to Prestige it is still not rectified on all the jar.

I think above 2 point itself make useless of using thhe product.

So think twice before you buy the product

Even after complaint to change the product got with negative reply from prestige.",5
6124,Good Product - Good deal by Amazon,"Do not buy.Defective piece will be sent.Ordered it for older parents as its difficult for them go shopping outside. Mixie Stopped working after first use(it was used once for checking).Also,return window is closed after 2 weeks.Its hardly 3rd week of buying and after using once this piece of junk ,they are worrying about ways to fix it instead of happily using it.Called amazon customer care regarding the issue.They told us to call prestige customer care,instead of replacing it.Regret giving my older parents a pain in form of this mixie.You will definitely regret buying it.Total wastage of money and time!",5
6125,Modify,"Not a good product. On first use the reset button went fail.. and cutter blades not working.. calling replacement denied by seller
Thereafter-3/4 more calls for repairs - reset switch burnt again, then on use noticed not cutting vegetables-discovered blades were reversed put and now the Motor making noises and not working-the 5th use of new mixie! Never buy any prestige product-a-shear wastage of money and time",5
6126,Knob gets melted . Heavy noise . Useless,"Today 31st May I got this mixer delivered, Packing was good, after unpacking I just plugged in Mixer & switched it on to check the speed but guess what the speed controller switch has 3 levels but mixer works only on speed 2&3. It does not start at level 1.

very upset, immediately placed a return and replacement order.

mixer does not",1
6127,It didn’t last even a year.,"Manageable noise level with compact size and four jars for this price, it's a deal to buy.
First impression on look is a OK for me, bcos the product finish was not so good. Looked dull may b os that color only is avl. If abyothe rbright color was there, I would have gone for that.

But the size is very sleek and portable to carry. Four jars with his price is something we can acall an economic offer and go for it. Prestige is always good and this is one more product yu can go for if yu have budget 🤠.",3
6128,Defective product,"Update after 1year of use-
Overall quality is pathetic.
I used 20-22 times this mixer in 1 year. But its chutni Jar (smallest jar) is choked in 2-3 use only. Got it repaired from local shop but again choked in 1 use.
Now its useless.
Juice jar's inbuilt filter is just for show. It does not work well, if you want to takeout full glass of fruiy juice, half of that will be pulp & grinded seeds for sure.

Not able to contact customer care since I purchased it. I doubt if they really exist. 😀

DO Not Buy this. Prestige is TTK group & I think as they are earning much from other business so do not care about this Brand's Reputation and so selling ANYTHING!!!

Only positive side is its 750w powerful motor. (which I now doubt to stay long 😉)

Plastic material feel & finishing is very cheap.
Steel jars are very thin & light weight.

DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS.",1
6129,Worst product started giving problems within 6 months :(,"Most mixers, grinders I have taken in the past have worked atleast their warranty life though have been much cheaper but this product died out within 6 months. This overpriced and worst quality product dont understand has such a high rating. The speed knob is rotating 360 degrees, the jars wore out in 15 days and make a lot of noise, the worst part is their service, they ask for physical warranty card. If I have an invoice, that should be sufficient, the invoice has the model details, they still insist on warranty card. Their pressure cookers quality is also very poor, anyway I stopped buying Prestige, recommend the same to all as well, stick to some other brand. Note: I can add pictures too but so many others are already there, so didnt feel the need.",1
6130,Good product but shipping was worst in terms of packing.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 This is very bad Service, returned the item first there was sound of loose parts inside. Pointed out there was no QC check.
They replaced the item
The new mixer grinder had several QC stickers 😄😄😄 The Motor was (DOA) DEAD ON ARRIVAL. had to return it. Now will have to buy something somewhere without discount. What a shame!",4
6131,Old used product received,"I bought this mixer because Amazon showed it as most bought. I had Philips mixer earlier and it was so much better, so less noise and even grinding. This prestige one is so noisy and the grinding is not good either, there are still chunks of food left even after grinding for a long time. Also, just after 1.5 months of usage, the plastic shaft at the top of the mixer and the bottom of the jar melted and I had to get it changed. Such rubbish mixer, waste of money",1
6132,Satisfy with this product,"In a week time, the plastic jar covers started cracking. Not sure if they can be replaced.
Very low quality plastic used to make jars. Did not expect this type of worst quality from Prestige.

Prestige should really think about this and try to improve the quality of the materials used to prepare their product. unless they want to sustain in this market.",5

6134,"Moderate performance overall, people going to regularly not preferred for them.",Please use and test the product within the return period. For any issues you will have time for returning. I used it 2-3 times after I bought it in Oct 2019. Now after 2-3 times use it's not working. So test as much as possible before your return date ends. I made a mistake by not using it too often. I would recommend better buy from your nearest local store.,2
6135,Product broken after one month use,"As expected from prestige, product is good. You can easily use it as it is light in weight and small in size. Less noisy and easy to clean. Rubber at base makes mixer stick to ground to reduce vibration. You may smell rubber burning upto 6-7 times use but nothing to worry. 750 watt motor makes it working fine in grinding dry or wet things.",1
6136,be careful,"This is hardly 6 months old. From day 1 the lid wouldn’t stay we have to stand and hold it right otherwise it keeps popping out and can splash the kitchen.
Worst is 2 days back the blade broke while grinding.
This is WORST DESIGN only the motor is higher power other all parts are poor design can’t stand the motor load. You can see so many other photos also where the bush is broken etc. this is a useless mixie please don’t waste your money!",2
6137,"Worst Product, do not buy online","On contrary to my expectations, this is resulting to be a wrong buy. It sounds exactly like my mixer which is replaced after using for 4.5 years. My child wakes up with its sound (so it is understandably noisy). On first I thought the product is new so my be noise get low with some use. But the noise level is the same (very High).....

I would not like to recommend this product as I am extremely unhappy with this product.",1
6138,Cheap quality,"I never thought that the brand Prestige is going to sell such worst product. Believe me only few of lucky customer might have got a good working mixer otherwise this mixer grinder is having defect.
1) Most common problem a burning smell after a grinding, it is due to friction between parts, which leads to damage of bottom parts. I personally replaced the part called Bush 3 times.
2) Mixer makes huge noise.
3) Mixer pots get too much hot while grinding.
4) Mixer pots are not durable. The bottom plastic part breaks easily.

I hope this review is helpful to you.

मैं ने सोचा नही था के प्रेस्टिज जैसी कंपनी ऐसा घटिया मिक्सर बेचेगी.

मिक्सर जब भी चलाओ उस मेसे जलने की स्मेल आने लगती है ऐसा इसलिए क्यों की मिक्सर का पॉट और बेस एक दूसरे के साथ बहोत फ्रिक्शन करते है और जल्द ही खराब हो जाते है। यह प्रोब्लम एक दो लोगो की नही है ज्यादातर लोगों ने यही कहा है।
फिर अगर आप खरीदना चाहे तो beat of luck.",3
6139,Good but warranty on motor 2 years,"Product material quality is very poor..!!
What I purchased from Prestige showroom 3 yrs bk product was good.. Used quality plastic on that..

I wondering why the same product quality is cheaper than showroom product..?
It's a type cheating the customer who trusted this Home furniture Brands like prestige...
And I don't recommend this product for home..",3
6140,Good product. Value for money,"Product (Prestige Iris(750 Watt) Mixer Grinder with 3 Stainless Steel Jar + 1 Juicer Jar,White and Blue) is good.working without any problem. I got 10% cashback : ) . Thanks amazon.
Though I'm happy but I have few concerns regarding the way of product delivery. Amazon should increase the level of standards in delivering any product.what i saw was just horrible, droping,crushing,climbing over other products to get the specific one out from vehicle. And there was no extra cover of amazon over my product.anyway i got my product in right condition.",4
6141,Juicer jar is waste,"Please don't go for it seller isn't genuine product looks cheap, motor isn't placed properly if you look closely into image you can notice propeller like thing raised at one end due to which jar doesn't locking perfeclty",3
6142,Delicate material quality and durability is least expected for the quality provided.,"Ordered the Item on 23rd January, delivered by Amazon on 27th January, received in good condition, packing is good, genuine Prestige product.
After using the Mixer Grainder for few days, my reviews of the same as following:
1. Build quality - Main unit is Good, cable length is sufficient, juicer jar made from polycarbonate material. Rest of 3 jars are SS with Plastic lid, quality of ss used for jars, not upto the mark.
2. Noise - Very noisey.
3. Operation - Easy to use.
4. Cleaning - Easy to clean.
Overall satisfactory peoduct if you ignore the noise.",1
6143,Fake Brand pathetic and cheap quality products It makes lot of noise pathetic product cheap quality,"Worst product, I was using earlier Prestigue mixture grinder and want to buy one more mixture grinder for my hometown, but literally its was worst experience I ever have.
Too much noise
blade not good
motor capacity not good
motor can't take little overload
juicer jar useless

Thank GOD I am able to return it because I found all these drawback in single use

If I am writing so much that means literally I want to acknowledge you guys for what I have experience.

I would literally not recommend to anyone to buy this rest is your choice for me its zero ratings product",1
6144,Best Mixer in this Price and great power,The 750-WATT motor of this mixer grinder got burned within a week of buying. Not working any more,5
6145,Worst product not worth buying,I had a very bad experience with this product. Ordered this after seeing lot of reviews but worst product have ever seen. First of all packing was very bad which shows they do not care about the product safety. And coming to product the mixer shakes like a hell when started which scare us whether it will blast when started and the noise is like from number of vehicles on the road. As you see in the picture the mixer jar is tightly getting attached to the mixy rotating clip when used and the heat is too high. I was very frustrated after using this on the first use and wasted lot of time in ordering Amazon. It surprises that a brand company do not care about quality and it was completely looks like they sent a used product. Amazon should look and take proper action for sending these kind of products but when complained same to customer care they apologise and say we do not repeat it in future nothing more than that.,1
6146,Worst Product. Don't buy,"Very poor product. Cant Even grind basic stuff. It takes so much time. Juice jar has leakage. Never to buy such things online.
Neither amazon nor prestige customer care supporting. Though the product was seal packed, it has poor quality. It cant do any grinding properly. Raised issue with prestige customer care, even the executive said it will be same and they cant do anything when bought online",1
6147,Product not reliable,"Please do not buy this product. Not worth it. After using it for quite sometime now here are my observations.
Noise - The machine makes more noise than the actual work it performs.
Performance - Too bad. I had earlier used mixer grinder from Maharaja Whiteline and even their 500w machine was way better than this one.
Also, the screws and joints of the jars get dismantled very often.

Complete waste of money.

And my review is based on two machines I had purchased and both of them have the exact same set of issues.",2
6148,"Dont look at negative reviews, the product is really very great!!","I bought the Prestige Iris MIxer Grinder through Amazon on 30th Jan 2021.. Got it the very next day. On opening I found a damaged,untidily packed , Mixer Grinder. Finding it difficult to get response from Amazon, I contacted TTK Customer Service. They agreed to replace it , which they did on the 7th.February 2021.It was a brand new piece & I was very happy. But on using it twice, I found the Coupling on the base part of the Mixer Grinder, coming off dangerously.After some complaining the mechanic checked & sort of rectified it. A few days later again the same thing happened. I immediately informed TTK customer service.They said the mechanic would come after the Lock down in our area etc. Lock down is eased. but no one has come. Meanwhile due to sheer necessity I had to buy another mixer Grinder. I have requested TTK to take back their defective product and give me a refund, as I have hardly been able to use the mixer grinder a few times. No mechanic has come to check, nor have I received a reply regarding the refund. I am writing this on July 5th 2021.
Expected better response from a Well known company like TTK",5
6149,Within 1 month small jar broke,Its a fourth class product. in past 6 month it stopped working twice. all containers started leaking from below and they dont come in warranty so i have to purchase them again. customer support is again pathetic. they are telling me that there is a lockdown in my area so they couldn't repair but in reality their system is outdated not showing correct data.,1
6150,No Prestige at ALL. Don't buy. Inferior product. Useless Service,"Very poor customer care from prestige. Whenever you call them they will register a complaint but no one will address those tickets.
No tracking no response.
I got 2 years warranty but no use its just for selling product online to attract customers.
I have Brought this with in 6 months only not working.
Waste of money and time if we by prestige products online they won't respond on customer service related issues.",1
6151,Faulty product received worst service from Amazon never buy,Mixie quality is good but locking mechanism is not at all good.. Have already exchanged it once although the problem still exists mostly..I think its a defect of the design itself..the locking grid of the jars are too small to fit in the main unit resulting in the jar fitting loosely having a tendency to jump out if not alert.. I,1
6152,Very Powerful Grinder,"I mainly brought it for 2 things

1. With juicer attachment
2. 750 watt power

The best i could find in this price range and i would like to gift this quality product to my friends instead of buying useless gifts.

Thanks",5
6153,Wonder at this price,"Prestige Iris 750 Watt Mixer Grinder.
It is an excellent quality product.
I am using this from past 3 months,
You get 4 Jars with it and they are easy to clean after use.
Noise level in this mixer is acceptable.
Overall it is a Wonderful Product for its Price.
Prestige Brand provides very good quality product",4
6154,Very poor quality China product,I did not realize till now that the gasket for one of the mixers is not provided. Disappointed. I know it's too late to ask for the gasket or a replacement. Also the base is not very steady. It is very light and keeps moving from its place when trying to unload or load the mixer. The motor is fine so far. But not a very good product from a brand like prestige. Either that or I received a defective product.,1
6155,Try and know customet support before buying to make an informed decision about this product.,"Please do not buy this duplicate and cheap product. Within few days of usage, the speed button stopped working. The return period was very short, and we couldn't even return the product. I called the customer service of @ amazon, They refused to give me refund saying you have to lodge complaint with the manufacturer and gave me a no of prestige service center. The service center says since we bought with Amazon for replacement you ask them we only do warranty servicing. Full money is gone down the drain as we don't have the time nor the energy to do the follow ups with these things due to our busy schedule. Please people be careful before doing this purchase.",1
6156,Not worth even if they give for free.,"I brought this mixy on 4.09.2020. After use for one month, switch is failed to work. Running in full speed directly. Very disappointing experience. Later Bush coupler (connector) of the mixy also broken, it seems that i received a defective one. I have made a complaint on 1.11.2020 and several reminders also made to TTK customer service, but in vain.
No technician till now (16.11.2020)
. I never expected such experience from big companies like TTK.",1
6157,Average Product,"Writing this after using 1.5 years. Even it cannot crush Banana completely ( forget about grinding some solid material). It takes a lot of time to crush Banana. That too, some big parts will be left uncrushed.
If you are thinking of purchasing it for juicer, you cannot extract juice from a fruit. Totally waste of money.
Better, go for Gopi or Bajaj for mixer and grinding.

And a separate machine for juice.
Note: Earlier I used both Gopi. And Bajaj. I purchased this in a sale as it has extra feature of juicer.
Philips totally disappointed me.",3
6158,Plastic quality is Low,"Worst product. There is a burning smell mixed with plastic and some motor oil smell. Altogether disgusting smell & taste to the juice I tried to make. Another drawback is it doesn't juice fruit properly. When I tried to get a replacement at the Prestige shop in Chembur, they said this model is old, banned because of problems. .Amazon is selling you bad stock. Prestige can't do anything about it.",2
6159,The position of blade is wrong,"I bought this mixer after reading positive reviews during Amazon great indian festival. We were out of town for some emergency when the mixer arrived so couldn't check it immediately. After coming back when we checked it was not working. By that time the return policy period had also got over so couldn't return it. Have been following up with customer service for replacement without any headway. Will lodge a formal written complaint if no response received..
Will update the review once receive some feedback from Prestige..",1
6160,Had to returned it.,I have received used product. You can see scratch on jar and on the plug. When i was unboxing this product then it's smelling like moter heating. So i have tried and take a run for 2mim continuously then moter smelling bad so i have request replaced this order but i want return my money because i have not trust on amazon last 3 to 4 delivery. Because multiple time i have received used product.,2
6161,Very useless product and equally useless service,"Wonderful product. I bought it for 2499 during Amazon sale, market prize is 4999. Awesome product..go for it",1
6162,Average product Not for Heavy use,"Noise is very high. The blades were just cut and they didn't even sharp it.
I'm wondered how this useless product is the best seller. Getting a doubt if it is a paid promotion. The juicer jar has got a mesh and it is not fixed i.e, there is a gap in between the mesh and the mixer which completely doesn't serve the purpose. Total waste of money.",3
6163,Warranty Card Missing,"Manufacturing quality is very bad. Bowls are not fitting in mixie, abnormally tight. Cutters are fitted eccentric (out centered) in all bowls. Running sound is horrifying .. Request PRESTIGE to stop producing and remove such third grade product from selling list, else we will stop relying and buying PRESTIGE products in future.",5
6164,Noise level too much. Not sufficient for grind hard things like turmeric,"Unusual sound. Drive wheel of mixer and driven wheel of all jars are wearing out.I changed all the wheels once but still the same problem. I doubt some alignment problem with mixer and jar. Not having time to visit local prestige service
NOW I AM USING MY OLD MIXER OF 25 YEARS OLD,WHICH IS WORKING VERY FINE.

UPDATE: FAILED........ MIXER BURNT JUST AFTER 2 YEARS. OUT OF WARRANTY NOW,HARDLY USED 20TO 30 TIMES IN LAST TWO YEARS.
WORST PRODUCT",3
6165,Defective Product,"Hopeless product! Very less power, gets stuck intermittently. Already replaced 2 spare parts spending money from pocket inspite being under warranty because of lockdown. Have used it for around 8 months now and already thinking of buying a new one. This is only food for very light usage.
I would highly discourage you from going for this model.",2
6166,Product Quality,"Stopped working after 1 week of buying.contacted prestige customer care, they told issue will be sorted in 3 to 4 working days but didn't, again I called them,same reply from them and still not sorted out, even after repeated complaints,no satisfactory response.... Finally after 21 days service man came and repaired.

Firstly product stopped working just in 1 week(read the user manual before operating and followed too),Very poor response for repair service.

This will be my last product of purchase from prestige (they themselves say as number one kitchen appliances company in India,but to me they are not definitely)",2
6167,Very weak machine,"Honestly giving this review to all.
Blindly don't buy this mixer as it is cheap.
I purchased due to low cost. I m writing cons first as you must read first.
CONS:
1. Mixer quality is bad. All plastic components.
2. Motar sound is very high(noisy).
3. Bad smell coming from mixer after 2 or 3 times of use.
4. Jar quality also bad, seems stainless steel but it is bending when you hold jar tightly.
5. Finishing of jars are not good.

PROS:
The one and only advantage is light weight 😂.
So please don't buy this prestige iris mixer.",1
6168,90% chance of receiving a broken lid,"It is used less times only, five months before get some technical issues, i get technical support from prestige. Technician came and issue solved, after the one day , again another issue found, Machine not working, after that customer service representative came and services the machine, again same issue ..This is third times in five months. Actually now I'm uses ,Prestige Iris 750 Watt Mixer Grinder with 3 Stainless Steel Jar + 1 Juicer Jar (White and Blue) for lizards nest in House. Very bad performance in mixer grinder. I not support to purchase family members and friends this Prestige Iris 750 Watt Mixer Grinder with 3 Stainless Steel Jar + 1 Juicer Jar (White and Blue).........",1
6169,Totally Bad experience and worst product.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I received this product 3 months ago and firstly received the rotater is bend in is position I return the product the next item I get is also same problem don't think so but we get it nd finally next time the returned item recieved is not bad but after using 2-3 months it's failed . Am attaching the video nd pics the jar is strucked where it is placed forcefully removed it is overcome with the below rotater also. So I have been faced lot of problems with this product I request to Amazon don't sell like this products .most of the people got same problem with this product but you didn't change the product what is it man ....🤦🏻‍♂️",1
6170,smart one please make perfect for noise level,"Worst mixie we had in our life, my wife complained every time she uses.

a) It's not grinding fine Paste is a Bix issue
B) if you run it for few seconds continues then the power cut happening and we have to wait for more than hours

Worst worst mixie",5
6171,High pitch sound,"The mixer grinder is quite good. But please do not buy the juicer attachment as the idea of the sieve attachment in the liquidising jar is flop. The Juice that is sieved out, goes back into the pulp. The the juice doesn't get extracted properly and it's a total waste of money. So just go for 3 jars and avoid the juicer attachment. Rest all is fine.",4
6172,Motor of the mixer,"The manufacturer didn't bother to clean the jars before dispatch. Jars were stinking badly with oil smell while opened and remained even after five six washes. It is very noisy, one can not talk in drawing room if the mixture is in use in kitchen.",3
6173,"Defective product, waste of money","The juicer is the worst thing I have come across this year. The touch-me-not juicer jar is not at all user friendly. The only utility you can derive is to paint your walls with it, just pour the required amount of paint and turn it on. That's all it's good for. I painted mine with cold coffee.",1
6174,I wouldn't go for it.,Completely satisfied with the product. Prestige is one of the well renowned brand. Quality of the mixer is good and the motor is very powerful. This product is fully packed with features at a great price . I recommend this to you go for it...,1
6175,Product is good,"Very poor overall performance.
With just a week's usage, it was noticed that the knob was not functioning properly. The machine gets switched off while returning from level 2 to level 1. The noise is louder than my 5 year old mixie. The chutney jar gets stuck in the machine often and is very hard to remove. Once it got stuck so badly that we had to try using tools to remove it.
If I could return this product, that would have been the first thing I'd have done.",4
6176,Burning smell and Motor problem,Worst product...i have been using it from few months...the motor stopped working within a month of usage...had to go all the way to service center to get it repaired which was too far from my home and had to collect it after 2-3 days...now again its giving me problems.... burning smell comes when i operate it plus sparks are coming and sometimes i have to manually push the blades to operate...now i again have to take it to service center to rectify it...it has become a liability too soo.... pathetic service and pathetic product.... didn't expect such downgraded product from Prestige,1
6177,Useless,"Worst service by Prestige. I bought this product in August 2020 and within 20 days the coupler got damaged. I registered the complaint through prestige customer care. I have been waiting for 15 days and it is not yet resolved. When I called again the customer care, came to know that my request was already closed as completed by their service guy. Such irresponsible behaviour from their service team and no professionalism.

Worst experience and would always think twice before buying prestige appliances.",1
6178,Fake product,"Let me clear one confusion I've seen many customers writing that they received a damage product but in my case I ordered this one two times but both time its perfect not even a single scratch on it
And the product quality also look steady",1
6179,Discrepancy of Serial Number on Invoice & Product,"Absolute ridiculous.. This dealer.. First product I bought thinking prestige is a known brand.. It stopped working within a week.. They sent us a replacement which I recieved today.. I opened it to find the wheel of the base unit is tilted.. I thought it may be my bad.. It may still work.. However when I put the Chutney Jar use its marking loud noise.. I can't dare to use the product any further.. Immediately writing and email for money refund..

Did not expect such a service or product from Prestige.. Really disappointed..",1
6180,Stop working on 11th day also no warranty.. As written,"Did mistake of purchasing this mixer grinder thinking it’s Prestige.
Buying a product below 4 rating was a mistake.
This cannot even grind tomatoes easily.
Please avoid this machine and go for Bajaj instead. If budget is not a constraint, go for Sujata or Preethi",3
6181,Worst experience ever had in any of the online shopping sites product is not good product,"I am writing this after one year of use. While the product is decent for 700w. My problem is with the juicer vessel provided with the grinder. Its of plastic and all of a sudden while making a juice, it under went a crack. The plastic is clearly of a low grade. This made my whole experience worst.",1
6182,Normal or poor quality.,Used for 9 months only and it has stopped working. The older mixer we have is more than 6 years old and is actually still working but since the jugs and all had broken we replaced it with this. Definitely a bad choice. Please think twice before buying it. The build quality is really bad. It feels cheap and there are things moving around inside it.,3
6183,Unprestigious,"I'm not sure, how this product is having so many 5 and 4 Star rating...seems to be fake.
The product gives burning smell while using.
Secondly the small jar blade came out after 30 odd uses and other jars lid opens automatically...
Seems to be a fake product by Prestige and Amazon should stop promoting such fake products.",2
6184,Product is good,"Mixer regulator problem, it runs in 1,2,3 . But I can't turn it to ""off"" position and ""whip"" position. I got a defective piece. It's very irritating , when main power on, the mixer gets started because it is in position 1 and cannot be turned to its off position. Defective piece received.",4
6185,Defective product,"Great product from prestige as always
We are using prestige mixer for 15 years. So ordered the mixer from prestige due to heavy durability of their product we have used.
Please don't read negative reviews and just go for the product.",1
6186,Not At All Recommended.. please don't buy,"Not great
I am planning to return it. The small chutney mixer hardly works for making any chutney . It takes a lot if time and doesn't grind well. Tried coconut chutney wasn't smooth at all, did not except for coriander chutney . It took ages but dint come out to be a smooth paste.
The machine stops working while grinding in between. Then I need to reverse the machine, press a small Little nob and then it starts working again.
Not expected this from prestige and that too 750 wts grinder",1
6187,Stopped working in 20 days!!!..,"Their are Two reasons for disliking this Product :
1 . Its Juicer is not that good as is shown in all reviews its pulp gets filtered but chokes the juice which has to come.
2 . This is the most bad part ,PRESTIGE service is worst ,their service technician don't even come to your house nor make any contact for complain raised by customer , now who might be wanting to take a mixer in which services are like this, its like you can take any ordinary brand mixer and get it repaired from local vendor .",1
6188,Not value for money. And company should talk to quality control team before delivering products.,"Very disappointed
They give me 2012 manufactured product in 2020
Almost i called 2 times to customer care for its service and repair in 6 months.
Oil started leaking machine makes sound of jammed.",1
6189,Worst buy & mixer grinder stop working within 9 month. No customer support!!!,"Noise is too high...... and stopped working after 9 months while using it ....
Make complaint to company,..
But customer support is more quick then expected...
With the complaint lodged, next day machanic reached home ....
Only miner error was their, a switch below the machine get reseted...
Well done for quick redressal.......and great customer support.",1
6190,"Not up to the mark , bad quality",I bought this on 23rd November 2020. The plastic lid of one of the grinding utensils broke in the first week itself. Tge regulator knob fell loose within the first week. Don't go by the name prestige.. It's not a cookware to trust them. Worst quality of product.. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING WITH DISCOUNT. Complete waste of money!!,2
6191,Good mixture but worst juicer,"Very poor build and quality, the plastic knob which locks the jar is poor plastic and got damaged on first run, the jars are smaller in size compared to other brands, overall it is a much hyped product and not worth it, cheap priced products will be cheap and its true, spent some more money but buy quality",4
6192,Worst product,"I brought this in February 2019. The mixer produces a very loud noise for its size. We are just a couple and use it occasionally. It was running fine till mid 2020, but then smoke and smell often started coming out of it. Then the plastic coupler failed. Also the blades got blunt just after a year. Now the motor has burner out and I am waiting for 45 days to get it replaced by Prestige as it is still under warranty. The customer care response is pathetic and there is no proper way to escalate the complaints. Please don't buy this cheap overpriced plastic mixer.",1
6193,"Good, received the item fast and it works efficiently","Bought the grinder with huge belief in the brand of Prestige, but the product was nowhere to the standards.
It makes too much noise.. unbearable

The product was faulty and the coupler came loose within 2 months of purchasing the product..

Worst experience was yet to come..
their service was pathetic..to replace the coupler (for which I had to pay) I literally had to call the customer service DAILY..they took 15 days to replace it and the entire process has made me lost all my faith in ""PRESTIGE""

Do Not Buy This Product",5
6194,Waste...cheap materials used,"Firstly, Thanks to Amazon and the concerned dealer for their prompt actions...

However, the first piece had turned out to be faulty...the coil burnt in third-fourth use.....The mixer was immediately replaced by Amazon....The smallest jar of the replaced mixer seems to have a design/manufacturing fault, it makes abnormally loud noise and seems unsafe so cannot be used....the middle size jar seems to be functioning fine...however, this is an issue of concern....",1
6195,Motor burnt in 15 months,"The noise lvl is too high,. And the juice jar plastic (material) is not of good quality,. I mean they should have modified the design. Not a better design for regular purposes. If u use mixi once a week,. Then good product and the quality of clip is too poor. Too noisy. And that clip slips and no proper grinding. So bad product.",3
6196,Very good powerful motor,"Your Product is worst I ever seen.Within 15 days,Motor Stuck ,Juicer Jar Broke .It this the real Prestige utensils.I have doubt on you that you are selling original product.Form today I decided to leve the Amazon Platform as well as Prestige Utensils .thanks You

I gifted this mixer to my Sister on Raksha bandhan and on 14 Aug ,It Became worst product i ever seen. Sister thought I gave them Worst Product

And whenever we called on their Toll-Free Number only they assure us that their technician will come.

If the machine stops working within 10 days & afterward no one is there to attend the complaints. what is the purpose of purchase PRESTIGE BRAND?",1

From the day one, it was too noisy for even very less load.

The motor and jars stopped working within 4 months of purchase and let me give more clarity, this is with minimal use of the product. I'm fed-up running with this product to get it serviced and the service centers are NOT beside my door step.
Didn't expect such cheap product from a well known brand""PRESTIGE"" and ""AMAZON"". They're only looting money.
Deeply saddened and disappointed.",5
6202,Bad bad product.,"Im wrinting review after 2months of use, im not at all satisfied with this product, jars are plastic and greesy smell. complete dissopointment.",1
6203,Very bad quality,Using from 1 and half year.Chutney jar not working now.coming lot of noise and blades nut popping out. Even on calling to customer care no proper response saying contentment zone can't provide service. It is better to purchase electricals from the stores in hometown they will provide you the service without wait till warranty exists.,1

6207,Worst ever experience... Worst product.. broke within a month,"Firstly the coupler (rotating wheel) came tilted and even after replacement got it with the same problem. After calling the service center they fixed the issue. The couplers are made of poor quality plastic.
The mixer doesn't work well, it doesn't grind properly and big chunks can still be seen. And the blades are not of good quality.
The area around the coupler started to rust within a week as you can see in the picture.
The sound is very loud and irritating.
Will not recommend at all",1
6208,Good product but one big jar for wet grinding should,"Worst product ever in amazon; may be dealer Cloudtail doing fraud or there is something wrong with amazon deliver channel. I placed replacement as the juicer jar got demaged at first used and as a returned i got a replacement with brocken blades and surprisingly found a used ,years old non prestige beanded rusty jar in the box.""""WHAT IN EARTH!!"""",first time in my life. This is forth time Cloudtail India private limited delivers demaged item or used one. I requested amazon to do enquiry with the seller.",5
6209,Good,I got the worst product first time after just one use the blades got damaged as u can see in pic i didn't expect this from both amazon and prestige being a such a reputed company delivering a poor quality product but I got replaced with in 2 days hope this time I don't face any such problem will review after a month.,4
6210,Worst product from Prestige,"I purchased and choosed this mixer grinder among other due to the Capacity of Wet Jar i.e., 1.5 Ltrs as described in description,,
but when I measured it, I found that it is of 1.3 Ltrs and not of 1.5 Ltrs..!!
I could've given this product 5 star rating,, as I'm happy with the product in first view/use,, it's flawless..!!
Everything is nice about it,, Mixer is of Good Quality..!!
I'm writing this review on the same day of product delivered,, so let's see how it works in Future..",1
6211,Not in use,"Poor Quality of Jars ,now started leaking from bottom of 2 Jars ( whichever I have used. Inspite of keeping water level very low. I am really surprised are they not test these products before sending to customers. As this is the least expect a customer can expect.",1
6212,First time bad experience from Amazon,"Very bad quality of the product. I had bought this product trusting the brand name but the quality of jars is bad. It doesn’t do the one basic function it is meant to do... grind! It doesn’t even grind tomatoes, even after several minutes. Very horrible product. The jar for liquids does not have any clamps to hold the lid. There are screws on the bottom of the jars which makes it very difficult to clean. Overall, a very disappointing buy.",2
6213,My biggest mistake in 2020,"worst product purchased through amazon first time.
I am reviewing this after waiting a month
Prestige company is not as expected.
within one month grill of the mixer had broken automatically.
I complained both Amazon and Prestige on 18-11-2020 on service No. they are still saying our technician will come and resolve the issue but till now no response from their end.
I suggest you all pls dont buy such bad quality product in the ne of prestige.",1
6214,Great option,Not up to the quality. Poor quality of jars. Made with Very thin and poor quality of steel. Body of machine is made with qlaityless plastic. Looking good due to compact design. But ultimately a poor quality product. Shown that not a prostate product and duplicate.,5
6215,Worth the buy...,I never had any issues with amazon product. Starting from groceries to large appliances i always choose amazon over other retailers. I’m amazon buyer from last 5 years. But first time I’m very disappointed with my buy. Within 3 months this product has stopped working. Tried to get in touch with prestige 3 times for warranty. But didn’t receive any proper response. It’s been a month and till now they didn’t send the technician.,4
6216,Coupler (gear) of the main unit (Mixer) is tilted and get damaged after single use.,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 From day one we were facing high level noise while using. And after three days we started getting burn smell. As mentioned in pamphlet we were following the instructions but it's started worst and we can see the sparks, heavy burning smell and annoying noise.
We doubt whether it is the original product?!!
Not at all satisfied...wasted time on looking for this product and read reviews at the time of purchase.",1
6217,Please take back the mixer/ grinder.,Worst product I have baught on Amazon. It stopped working within 2-3 months of regular use. Also Prestige's customer care is so dull and non responsive to the concerns raised. Amazon should ban the Prestige which doesn't care about customer and their problems. Pretty disappointed 👎,1
6218,Very bad quality,Purchasing time showing lot of additional boxes but received some missied please revet back..,1
6219,Good product but,I am compelled to write this review because of the bad experience. I bought this as a gift for my mother after reading amazing reviews on Amazon but to my surprise the mixer doesn't even work properly. Can't grind anything easily. This is too noisy and gets heated up SUPERFAST with a burning smell that would scare you. The jars are not sturdy and the jar cover broke within a few days of using this. Don't waste your money on this worst quality of a product.,3
6220,Help how I can return as I recently started using and found poor quality,"The display of the product is nice and neat. The usability and the cleaning process is also easy. This product is worth for the money. The only low light of the product is the huge noise. Even for a material like (not so hard) peanuts, the noise was as huge as building generator. (May be I was feeling as we live in a silent environment). If noise is not a big challenge, go for the product👍.",1
6221,Satisfied,we purchase Prestige Iris(750 Watt) Mixer Grinder from amazon on 23rd july 2019. we bought more than 6-7 Mixer grinder from Delhi product to Preethi . This Prestige Iris(750 Watt) Mixer Grinder is the worst quality we had come across. from our observation mostly Jar will get problem after a usage of 2 to 3 year. From the day1 Prestige Iris(750 Watt) Mixer Grinder start of use we found smell from the Mixer grinder. usage is very minimum hardly 2-3 minutes in a day. after 4 month it got failed. when we logged complaint they turned up after two days and took to their service center. it seems coil burnt. waiting for product to be delivered after service,5
6222,Product is found as defective,"this item was purchased and delivered on 16th Oct 2020, and on the 20th Oct, on the very first run, the mixer turned out to be faulty coz it got burnt up and smokes came out. Spoke to Amazon and they asked to contact Prestige and Prestige has been avoiding me as a customer and has not managed to get a technician sent to replace the product. Escalating now to Consumer Court.",1
6223,Waste of Money and time,"This mixer grinder is not even grinding properly. I must say it is waste of money. Only the small jar works nicely and grinds properly.
The juicer is even worse. The pulp and juice is mixed whenever i tried making some juice. Its total waste. U can not seperate pulp and juice coz it just grinds the fruit and nothing else. Which u can do in any grinder. My money is wasted on a crap.",2
6224,"""DON'T BUY IF NO SERVICE, NO PRESTIGE PRODUCTS """,Broke down in the first few months. Didn't not any service / couldn't use warranty as customer care first sent us to a centre which was permanently closed and then for months kept saying they will call back. Have been getting it fixed locally every few months and it keeps breaking down again. So horrible that my family members believe we can't trust any electronic purchased online (because warranty of things purchased locally is not such a waste).,1
6225,"Please do not buy this product, it is sub-standard.",After using any Jar and do not use them for a few days they get Jammed inside. The reason is the rotor portion on which the blade sits gets rusted. I Have been using mixer grinder for so many years and never seen so inferior quality material till now.,2
6226,very bad experience..,"I bought this product on July 2020, I stopped working after 3 months. Coz of covid service was not available for almost 3 months. It is almost 1 year now, till date I registered complaint for warranty service multiple times, they send some complaint number as SMS, then NO RESPONSE. Whenever I call customer service, they will send new complaint number, and again NO RESPONSES. Worst product and Zero accountable employees.",1
6227,Prestige Iris is Bad product with Bad Service.,"Pros: Grinds well though it takes more to do it than normally taken by other mixies of in the same class

Cons:
Very very noisy
My old mixie (Philips) is better....less noisy......",1
6228,Heavy duty mixer,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I dislike the product because the lid of jar was broken in packing. I opened packing last day then I found broken lid. PLease exchange it after ending of lockdown",4
6229,Sensitive to overload,"Whenever it is running..it sounds as if a tractor is passing by...
Noisy too noisy.... disturbs the peace of all around you.
Kanphaadu...
Paisa barbaad
Isko ban Karo becoz of noise pollution
But you can buy if you want to waste your money and harm the eardrums of your entire family.
Also..get your kitchen sound proof..",2
6230,Fitting of jars issue and noise issie design defect in product,"Very useful product. Love to buy it again. It'sMake your kitchen complete .
Product is 💯 good and useful.

But packagings is very poor,, i received this product without Amazon packaging as u can see in the picture, this is delivered without any packaging. So please ensure the product safety and customer's products value",1
6231,"Don't buy the product only for brand name, customer care no response","I have been using it for a month but my mixer coupled broke. Dint expect dis quality from prestige. I bought it as many people had this mixer
And had a decent review. But should have seen the warning signs on comments. Don’t buy this product, it’s a waste of investment.",1
6232,Totally money wastage and worst service of prestige,"The machine does not work when you insert the jar and switch on, so basically I got the defective product. Also accessories missing. I don't think it's a Good purchase from a brand like prestige.",1
6233,Average,"I bought this mixer as a backup to my old mixer, which was on verge of going kaput.... I started using this mixer after 3 months of buying and the motor burnt out in the 2nd month itself !! I complained to the customer care and the technician came day before yesterday and repaired it, imagine my surprise when it has stopped working today as well!! This is the worst mixer in the market or the seller is selling a substandard refurbished product.",4
6234,Motor burned within 3 months,"Generally the product quality is not upto the mark. The spatula with the provision for fixing and removing the blades, is the worst one. Very very flimsy. I could not remove the blades from the jars using this spatula. I had to use the competitor's spatula, which was really sturdy, to remove the blades. Quality of the blades and the couplers are of poor quality. Only the stainless steel jars seem to be of good quality.",1
6235,Mixer,"It is worthless product. Not working after 10 months. When sent to Prestige repairing center , they claim on line products are not real company goods. Amazon is falsely selling product with no guarantee. They even did not entertain repairing the same. I wonder WHY AMAZON IS SELLING SUCH DUPLICATE PRODUCTS.
DO BOT BUY SUCH PRODUCTS ON LINE WHICH DO NOT STAND GURANTEE.
AMAZON Should undertake repairs or RETURN full money for selling FAKE
products.",1
6236,Can be used only for 3 months with this quality,Very high noise ...if u think that 750w means less noise then u r wrong ..its more than 500w,1
6237,Not easy to handle,"Very waste product, we opened the product after 10 days of delivery, the mixer is not at all starting and there is sound inside in the mixer when we shake it and now the return window is also over, not able to cancel the product.
Can Amazon team suggest me, how I can return this waste product.

Even after raising the service request, a person visited the house and he replaced the entire machine and said it will work, now after that next day again the prestigious prestige iris mixer is not at all working.",1
6238,OK,The Switch broke within 6 months and I had to pay 250 rupees to get it fixed in a nearby shop. The shopkeeper told me this model has weak switch and it is only better in other brands and some other model of Prestige (forgetting its name),3
6239,Damaged product received,"Ideal for a nuclear family. Perform well. The plastic part inside the juicer, which is used to push down the fruit parts, is very fragile and cracked during second usage. Rest are wirking as per specufication. The noise level of the motor is pretty high and disturbing. Because of these two factors I am compelled to rate it as 4-star. Otherwise, it is really a very good machine.",1
6240,Warranty problem,"Kindly note that the product is good but the ""Chutney Jar Lid"" doesn't have gasket as mentioned in the user's manual. It is loose. Please arrange the same.
Besides the envelope doesn't contain any invoice. It's empty.
Kindly do the needful to assure many more purchases in future...",4
6241,Started problems after 6 months,"Within a month of the purchase, the rotating fin at the top of mixer has broken. Now the mixer is just useless since it is being considered as mechanical damage caused by individuals and no guarantee can be applied in such case.

Wouldn’t recommend this product.",1
6242,Poor Quality material has been used,"Prestige mixer faulty item. Requested for replacement. Coupler is detached from the mixer. Not used once also. It is almost 20 days. Request for replacement made several times. Kindly replace the same at the earliest.
Pl revert to my email I'd vinaya3@yahoo.co.in
& my mob.no.is 9969227319",2
6243,Not satisfied,"This is worst product ever bought by me.
DO NOT BUY anything from Prestige ever.
To start with, it is Noisy. Blades are not sharp and motor is not powerful enough to do what a mixer should do.
It does not grind well anything.

Details:
Dry stuff has to be separately smashed and wet needs to be put on mixer for half hour or so. Even after that, the finished product is not even close to what we used to get using our old local mixer.
The technician who we called to fix this told us that this is how the quality of mixer is and it cannot be improved any further.",1
6244,Value for money...,"I just received prestige iris 750 w mixer grinder and juicer.
But moror is faulty.
I have order it for my urgent need.
Even jars are not fitted properly.
Please don't play with customers by sending them such a heavy cost faulty products.
Don't break people's trust from Amazon.
Which will affect on your business .
I require urgent replacement of properly working product.
We are investing our hard earned money.",5

I RECOMMEND NOT BUYING THIS!",5
6247,WORST PRODUCT !!!!,"It's a nice product, we were using it very harshly though working very fine all these times ..

Just one issue with motor I guess it's motor was not fixed or some screw was not fixed.

Mixer ko pick Karne par inside part hilta hai or Sahi se attached nahi hai otherwise all is ok",1
6248,Value for money.....,"First of all it came packed in a outer cover of Bajaj mixer grinder,without proper packaging looking like it was opened before and than again sticked with normal salo tape. Next there was not a single thermocal inside for the safety of the equipment,nor there was any manual,or warranty papers. Plus came with a jar lid broken.So I returned the item and refunded. Although mixer was ok with other jars .",4
6249,"Bad Product , Poor Grinding and too much Noisy product","Great product. Overall deserves 5 star. Great value for your money. Good sturdy build quality with decent fit and finish. powerful motor, great overall package.
The box is missing a gasket for the juicer box, hoping the seller is reading this review and will send me the missing gasket. This is minor issue and does not deserve to take away from the 5 star rating.",1
6250,Does not grind as required,"Very good and powerful.
Am able to effortlessly grind dry spices as well as Idli batter.
However, giving a star less cause the Juicer seperator doesn't work as advertised. Nor does it come with instructions which can help you utilise it properly.
If you're buying just for the juicer feature, would recommend buying something else.
Also the bases of the jars do not seperate without tools for cleaning.",1
6251,Worse design of product for mixing,"Pathetic experience.....One of the jars is missing the rubber in the lid...I did nt notice this during the return window. The smallest is the most used and after it for 6-8 times, the nut from the blades opens stopping the spin
I am heavily repenting buying....the buyer may be fraud or may be the piece is defective
Not sure if this is an original product.",2
6252,Worse product. Do not buy,"Amazing Amazon Sale...!!!!

The product is amazing. Less noise, powerful motor, stunning looks and stylish jar handles for convenient and comfortable grip.
Really satisfied with the product and delivery service.",1
6253,Blade Not Good,Product is Ok and plastic quality is not bad but not that good. Its average product and in this price with grt Amazon deal.. i think one should not expect perfect quality.. so I would say go for this product and use it.. you will not regret..,1
6254,"Pathetic Mixer, Worst Service.",Thanks so much prestige for giving us this fantabulous product on normal budget... Looks wise it is pretty and it's cleaning procedure is simple... One thing that is not satisfy me properly is its very loud noise... Everything else is cool prestige product... And also good delivery of this by amazon and amazon agent... Thank u so much prestige and amazon both😊,1
6255,Waste of money,"I got a duplicate product from Amazon. After using for couple of months, the motor failed. I repaired the machine from our local repair person. He repaired motor armature with new winding. After couple of months again the carbon brushes failed, which I repaired again. So overall its a duplicate product under the name Presitge",3
6256,Product nice awesome worth for money,Don't buy online service is very pathetic. It stopped working within 15days. Service provider is one big fraudulent. No body comes even after 6times lodging complaint on toll free service number. If u buy and have problems only way is to go consumer court for compensation. Amazon don't sell items where service backup is not available.we very much believe in Amazon sales. Don't play with our money and faith.,4
6257,Waste of money very poor quality,"The packaging is not good. The plug was little bit damaged. Since we were in urgent need we did not return the product and using it as is.
Product is good apart from the damaged plug. Noise is bit loud. And most of the grinding is done in speed 1 itself.",1
6258,Very bad product,"The jar lids made of plastic are very thin and can be bent by hand. The flywheel under the jars, which is the most used part of any mixer are made of very thin material which are likely to get worn out very fast and will require a placement in 1-2 years. The quality has been sacrificed for sake of price.",1

Easy cleaning and easy to use.
All over Nice product.",5
6262,Perfect mixer grinder for kitchen.,"I really liked the packaging and how safely it was delivered to me. So far its been more than a month am using this mixer grinder and it hasn't given me any problems. Yes, you might sense a burning smell initially while using it, but that's nothing to worry as it is the rubber of the motor which gets friction.",5
6263,Just go for it..........,"Decrease sound level and it's getting heat very quickly juicer should have levered cap on top it may sit properly
Now it's working condition is good I have a two years warranty let's see what happens

6265,Mixer is good but juicer jar is low quality,"I bought this 1 year ago. The juice maker was of very poor quality. It broke during use. After few months, it began to show electrical problem. The switch does not work properly. Finally after 11 months, it stopped working.",3
6266,Wrost product by prestige,"The product is defective. Got to know after about 5 mths that 1 jar, that I had not used earlier is leaky and the lower plastic rotor below another jar had come off after I used it 2 to 3 times. Had not expected this of Amazon. I want a replacement/refund now. But I guess it is too late. The order was placed on 25th of June. Delivery was on 3rd July if I remember correctly. That means I still have a few days left of the six mths allowed for replacement.",1
6267,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Worst product and quality of the same is disastrous. It started giving the issue within 6 months of purchase . Following are the issues

1. Leakage through the jar

6269,The Blade spindle needs design change,"Worst product, I have ordered preetige mixer grinder w/ 3jar m grinder. But recived used old product with only one Jar n grinder.

6272,Worst product of prestige,"With in months rotator broken, specially juice make not comfortable to use, air block always which cause to tighten the jar cover.
And switch also change some other direction just month later which some how manage to use, and we don’t know near services centre if far same cost and time we can buy new one, this warranty is now day useless since people do not have time to visit service centre.",1
6273,It's malfunctioning within three months!,"I purchased this more than a month back , now this product is useless for me as this got broken from motor . And now I am struggling to register my request to prestige !
Motor rubber which rotates the Jar got melt and broken and turned the whole piece Useless, trying to register my complaint online as return window got closed few days back",1
6274,Budget oriented product,"there are problems with grinding.. 3 4 times container cap just bounced up due to high grinding speed or may be due to heat inside the the container during grinding..
to prestige people: ask your engineer to work on container caps.. needs to handle air and heat pressure..",4
6275,Worst quality Don't buy,"The product was damaged. Don't not buy anything in Amazon. Online offers or Diwali sale in offer is a cheat.

Please do not buy.. Stay away from Amazon.. 😡",1

so far working fine.",5
6277,Waste of money to buy this product,"Good one

But in long run only the opinions can be given as warranty on motor is 2 years only where as in other branded products the warranty is 5 years on motor.
Only reliance factor is brand prestige.
So time will tell.",1
6278,Prestige Iris Mixer,"Good product with sufficient power, good features and juicer jar. Value for money.",1
6279,Expecting Amazon to help,Dont buy mixer with juice jar. For only juicer jar they are charging more than 1000 which is not easy to clean. So buy other mixer grinder without juicer jar and if you want juicer jar you can get outside for less price only,1
6280,Overall good product,"Not at all satisfied with the quality of material, very delicate jars and body. I am generally love prestige products for the durability, but these last few years i dont find quality products unfortunately.

6281,great,"quality and durability is ok yes but handles and jars are of good quality.
the Knob is of low quality and I doubt about the durability it makes a lot of noise.

6282,Duplicate Motor installed by Manufacturer,"Pros:-
1. Power of 750 watt gives you the best blending
2. 4 jars attachment is great.

4. Quick service
Cons:-
No cons are there in this mixer take it blind foldedly",1
6283,"The morter burnt, gave burning smell and it stopped working in 4 months time!!!",Very worst product. The mixer blade isn't that sharp it doesn't grinde anything into fine paste. Highly disappointing product. The blades become looser in a month. Defective product.,1
6284,This is worst product from Prestige,"Very worst product I have ever seen. Defect products they are delivering.Jars are not even fitting. Unable to use this product. Previously i was using a crompton mixie for 20yrs. After it damaged, i bought this and i regret for it. Customer service also very bad. For replacement they are asking me to bare charges for their defect product. I don't want to even give 1 star. I want to give negative marking",1
6285,Leaking Jars,"Pro -
1) elegant and convenient to use.
2) available at good price with all the jars

Cons -

2) not upto standard of Brand prestige.
3) poor service from ""Prestige"".
4) Dont know who should be blamed for this the seller or the brand",1
6286,Blade design and use is poor,"I gifted this to my mom and she loved it, yes it has little noisy motor. But that is normal for a 750 watt motor, the design is good and quality of jars and mixer is upto mark. It has a powerful 750 watt motor. Go for it. Don't look at negative reviews and change your opinion . Remember it is rare that someone gets a broken or damaged product from amazon sellers.",1
6287,Broken after few months,"Worst product, do not recommend. How come it's being promoted by Amazon as it's Amazon choice. The jar broke after few days use. Can' replace as replacement days are over

It's been 11days since I have registered my complaint made multiple calls sent 2 emails but nobody is bothered to revert back.

6290,Poor product with worst material usage for mamfacturing,"I'm giving review after using 45 days, very powerful moter easy to grind noise is high but you can understand it has a powerful moter so noise will be loud but overall the Prestige Iris grinder is awesome and I got it in ₹2250 in sale.",1
6291,Very good quality,"750 watt motor will definitely make noise. But you don't use it whole day. If you do, go for a super expensive one which doesn't make noise, still it'd make some noise. Good quality steel is used for making jars. Plastic is strong. If you properly fix the jar on the machine, its blades will work without any problem.",5
6292,It has been three months and working properly...,"Hi all, please refrain from buying this product, i bought it Oct 2019, now its gone, it does not work, i have to fix it by taking it to a local shop, too noisy...now the motor is gone,

Product stopped working even with simple use like making banana shake.",2
6294,"Good product, value for money","Please don't go for this. I have two of this. One I bought and one was gifted during marriage. Both stopped working in less than a year. The baldes in the jars are also not that so good. This one struggles with wet udar dal also. I agree it is easy to use, clean but I don't think these things matter if it stops working less than a quarter.",4
6295,Product is of sub quality,"I feel this is an average product. Juicer is not as per expectation. And the noise level is very very high. Rest all functions are good like chutney, masala and milk shake...",2
6296,Worst product and service,It's been 3 months i used this for 5 to 6 times. And the flange was wear out twice. When I was making penuh butter and second time when I was grinding raisin (dry graps). Thn after i got to know about plastic quality. And I have 15 yrs old Mixture which is still running without any problem. Go for the higher model.,1
6297,Not at all good product. Don't go for it,"The position of blade is wrong... You can't paste small amount of qty here, bcz blades place in upper position and not properly paste it ginger garlic etc,, too much disappointed after purchase it, Phillips Mixer is far better than this",1
6298,Prestige should check it's products properly before it's release into market...,"I had to return it as soon as it arrived because after plugging in to test it, it fail to start. I had purchased it during sale period instead of benefitting from the discount offered I incurred a loss in sending back the item. I didn't expect such undurable product from Prestige. I hope it is an isolated case.",4
6299,Value for money go for it,"Very bad service ony 4 days to bought this and used only 2 times and its motor stoooed running I have complained many times to prestige but just like I bought this product online, it's repair is also being done online. It has been 2 days, but only calls and emails are coming but none of their staff is ready to come please do not make the mistake I made by purchasing it",5
6300,Basic but good features.,"The build Quality is not that great,The Jars started rusting,Not grinding properly in short time unlike my previous Mixer grinder (I had Preethi Steel) we need to grind so long for fine grinding even after that few granules(like coconut,Ginger remains).

Better to invest little more money and get a best product .",4
6301,One of the best product,Nice product and timely delivery by amazon...warranty card was missing I request the amazon team to arrange it from the seller. So I like to request that please send me a warranty card as soon as possible.,5
6302,Good Purchase,"-Built quality is good .
-Light weight mixer grinder.
-But the cups are not fit with machine properly.
-noise of this machine is same as our old machine.
-performance is average.
-motor has 750watt power but the grinding power of this machine i feel 500 watt

After 15 day use i feel that in this price range you should chose phillips grinder as well.",5
6303,Prestige Iris Juicer and Mixer Grinder (Very Good),"Full Marks to Amazon for delivering the product on time , BUT, Prestige services are pathetic . This product is a third grade product. I have had two major issues in last two month , it takes atleast 7 days for their technician to visit and resolve the issue . The body of the mixer is not sturdy and the blades are pretty weak. Do not go with the brand name , it sucks big time",5
6304,Dusherra gift to mom,"I bought this product based on brand name ""Prestige"", however product quality is not at all good.. first of all noise is very high, second it takes longer time to give output of ingredients.. blades are not good..

Not sure if it have technical issue.

Pls. Advise if this can be returned as I did not used it more.",5
6305,juicer not working,Not a good machine. I bought thinking it’s a strong n sturdy machine but highly disappointed. Sometimes brands don’t care about the reputation. I have great admiration for this brand but this experience is disappointing. Unfortunately the return window is closed for this items or else I would have return it.,3
6306,Not recommended,"The dry container lid was broken so I replaced it again same thing happened so again I replaced it and what a coincidence same lid of the jar with broken lid was received.

Lastly my family was fed up of these things and they stopped me from replacing it as it is a much needed thing in the home
All around mixer works excellent but the dealer is cheap",1
6307,PRODUCT QUALITY IS VERY VERY POOR,"The plastic bin of mixer got damage after every 4 or 5 use.
Too much problems occurred after it and the prestige service faculty is also so cheap I registered a complaint 9 days ago but no service provider reached at home till now.",1
6308,Worst ever product,"the product is extra ordinary but as such the noise is more but please make it standard please product is good and perfect please buy my choice one
thank you",1
6309,Not good,"High pitched irritated soung
Easy to wash
Easy to grind.
But the problem s high pitch sound....I got 2900
But now the rate s same wat they mentioned now..nothing offer..simply",2
6310,Bad material.,"The motor of the mixer gets heated very quickly and i need to keep pressing the button beneath the mixer frequently. Its a brand new mixer, had high expectations. Hoping Customer support helps me in replacing the motor which has 5 year guarantee",1
6311,Noise is high,The rotor broke off after three months of usage. Prestige not ready to repair it in warranty neither the seller ready to replace it. Felt cheated here by Prestige as well as Amazon because defective product was delivered from Amazon's seller. Felling very apprehensive about making purchases on Amazon now,4
6312,Not worth buying.,"Starting of with the delivery of the package was horrible..Delivered in a unprofessional way.
The package had damages all over the packing.
The product quality really cheap, the plastic covering can break within a few days use.
Durability: The product won't last long...
Like mentioned in the description there is a burning smell from the motors and will last for few days.

It is light weight as the plastic used it really bad and but the motor power seems to b good.",1
6313,Highly recommended,"I bought this product as it's Indian company... But seems like they have only assembled here... Anyways, product is good, no problem at all.
But request prestige to make products in India n then sell it...",5
6314,Waste product,The product is very cheap quality and stops working and some burning smell comes out the mixer after using it for 5 min on level 3. The noise level is also too high and the quality is too poor. The lids of the jars are so lose everything spills around. It produces lots of vibrations and it becomes difficult to handle it. Buying this is completely worthless and waste of money.,2
6315,After 15 days electric product broken,The product is totally useless. I just open the box and use it first time but after few mins smell comes and I stop it and check and found that the nozzle was already burnt. I couldn't use it anymore. I ask to the customer care about the warrant part but no response. I m the permanent customer of Amazon but this is really unfair. Totally lost. Don't buy this product guys.,1
6316,Waste of buying,"This is not original from Prestige, only after few days of usage the couplings broken and came apart, when I approached the authorized servicing center, they said this is not original and refused to attend!",1
6317,i never recommend to buy this product,"Product is good, however, I found that serial number which is mentioned on the product is no where to be seen on the invoice. Tried contacting customer care and they suggested to write the review to the seller. I can change the rating to the highest as I didn't find any issue with the product provided this problem gets resolved. Thanks",2
6318,"Pathetic mixie, poor quality material, stopped working within a month","All seems OK physically... But Mixer stop working. Started once after resetting but again stop working... I need replacement if possible... How to avail warranty or get it replaced... Pls share.... Also called service center and registered complaint GUJA504828... As per them they will provide service free.. No malfunctioning part will be replaced for free.... It seems Amazon is cheating by writing 2 yr warranty... Warranty doesn't mean free service only.

Products is repaired by service Engg.... My above feedback was based on discussion with customer care.",1
6319,Defective product,Nothing is good I feels its not original prestige mixer within a month moter started over heating bocz of that above the plastic bush started burning. Waste of money and worst product. I suggest people not to buy this,1
6320,The worst ever product. Pls beware,"I like it, but quality is not better than other products, motore is good condition, but body finishing is not well, and it use for nor mal house working. Meet or heavy work is not comfortable.",1
6321,High Noise,"Writing the review after 2 years of usage.
Noise level is heavy. You will get fear while operating because of noise.
Had to go to repair shop 4 times in 2 years for replacement of fuse.
Jar's bottom plastic broke while using.
Not satisfied with the product",1
6322,Mixi is made by assembling old parts,Product is ok. But big jar though it has sharp blades it won't make fine paste if dosa batter is grinded or cucumber grinded. Cleaning is also difficult unless water is having more pressure. Juicer jar is very nice and small and medium jar is also good. I felt problem is with big jar,1
6323,At this price Moderate mixer,"Worst experience, since the day we bought this item, there was always a problem with the jars and the motor. The bush of the jar burnt twice and we replaced them. Today a big spark came and luckily nothing happened to the person nearby. Don't know if the seller has tested this product before dispatching. Surely received a damaged piece.",5
6324,Damage Jar Cap,Out of all the mixer we have bought till date this is the worst one. Doesn't grind smooth at all.... You run it for 2 to 3 mins continuously it stops... You need to wait for 5 mins press the red button on the bottom to restart and again run it 2 mins and again restart.... It's not helping grind fast it's wasting our time...,1
6325,Very Poor,"Its just been 20 days since i bought the product, it completely STOPPED WORKING!. Totally regret buying this product. Also the noise is too high and it did not deliver the expected output. Do not buy this product. Opt for someother brand like preeti. And i would not suggest amazon for electronic appliances.",1
6326,My review,"I received damaged product and it was exchanged . After using for one week, the newly received product is not working properly. I am unable to change motor speed as mob is not properly attached to main body. Further, the rotor which is being attached to jar was detached from motor rod after using for the first time. I request you to forward my complaint to Prestige.",5
6327,Most Horrible product and customer service,"Heating issue... Waste of money... Looks like the motor is not prestige... Gone fully within 10 months...

Update after 9 months - My mixer has been completely stopped working now. Looks like motor gone. Raised a complaint with Pretige customer care 1.5 month back. Still they have not attended. Planning to buy another brand. No more prestige. Worst mixer grinder and very bad service.",1
6328,Low quality product. Don't buy this.,Our 10 year old juicer still work better than this . I rather make it repair than this product,1
6329,Not good.,"All other jars are good.but juicer is not worth...it mix up all fruit pulp...not usefull...stainer placed in between is loose and no way to fix it
..",2
6330,Defective n Used product delivered,"As per the reviews i have ordered the mixer, but after receiving had very much bad experience.
- Grinding quality is very bad, even after grinding for multiple times we where able able to get the fine powder or the paste.
- Noise level is too much.
- Within few minutes of usage it smells plastic burning.",1
6331,specially juicer is not good. Additionally due to improper packing I think product ...,Happy to have bought this item and efficient product and a relatively cheaper cost. We liked the item. Very useful with the three jars that were received. Multipurpose blender.,3
6332,I need a technician to check the switch immediately,"Waste!!!
Please done buy it. After 1 month usage the plastic rotating holder for the jars got burned. Can't expect from a brand like Prestige. Dont buy",1
6333,Defective item,"I purchased the product in October 2019 as a standby mixer grinder. I hardly used the product about 10,12 times during the past 15 months.
Now suddenly the mixie is not getting started and a burning smell is coming from inside indicating burning of the motor
Since the motir is having a warranty period of 5 years kindly arrange repair",1
6334,VERY GOOD MIXER,"Good plastic, durable.
Stainless steel used is good quality.
Grinds swiftly .
Powerful motor.
A little noisy though.
Excellent buy
Will do dosa batter and update",5
6335,"Dissapointed,low quality","I opened after return period over due to time constraint.
When we use it... Burned plastic smell comes from the gap in the mixer.my previous mixer was Preethi. Which gave good durability. Still using it. guys go for Preethi mixer. I regret buying prestige product. it's only thing is brand , not quality. Now waiting when it will get problematic. Only one and half month over.",2
6336,Average product and quality,"Within 15 days itself mixer level switch rotation not working, gets heat up if we put less load also. Can't return the product too as it has just 10 days replacement.
Informed the customer care to come and take a look and get it repaired, they said service person will be arriving soon, it's been 5 days no one come yet!.",3
6337,Bad product 👎,I bought the product because of the brand name. It was a trusted brand name which is provided quality product since ages. I had a really bad experience not once but twice. Both with the quality of this product. I don't think Amazon should allow this particular product to be bought by their valuable customers. I don't trust Amazon anymore.,1
6338,Disappointed with quality,"Unbearable noise while grinding-0 star
unsafe lid- 0 star
(No lock on lid.... Lid quality average.)
Need to hold lid tightly while grinding..

High power motor 4star
4jars - 4star
Asthetic -3star
Grinding time -4star
Price -4star
Will I recommend this -No
I was expected much better product form prestige. Need to improve safty features & reduce noise.",2
6339,Very good,It is a good product. As it is 750 watts the noise level is higher than the normal ones. But leaving that apart the product is giving us a very good experience. Good colour. Good quality. Good material. The package delivery was very soon than expected. And the packing was excellent.,5
6340,Worth buying,The pins are of plastics and they broke after couple of uses. For each jars and even for the machine. Need to replace them from open market. Just don't buy this machine will give you headache from day one. Low quality pins in jar and in machine.,5
6341,There is no service,"Very bad product, the quality is pathetic.
The coupling quality is so bad that it cannot withstand the minimum load of the machine and breaks. I have already replaced this Mixer grinder before within 7 days of purchase for the same problem. My mistake I should have returned the product.
It's also very noisy, My first Bad purchase from Amazon",1
6342,Small container blade assembly problem,"Worst product i ever purchased on Amazon, juicer is not up to the mark .mixer doesn't grind food well , powders and coconut only 70 grinds not completely done. Even the free Government provided mixers far better than this. Really not worth at all......
Completely disappointed..",1
6343,Very bad .. Waste for money dont purchase,"1. After purchasing, within a week the grinder got stuck in the base. Made a complain to Prestige and after back and forth, they replaced the jar after a month. Tried to repair it first, then did not have the right colour.
2. Used for a couple of months after that. The base has started to heat up a lot and the quality of grinding and liquid mixer has gone down.
Have been a Prestige user of cookers and pans for years but this has been a huge disappointment.",1
6344,Not Bad.,when the motor is switched on you feel that some drilling machine is working. The service technician says it's like that for that model. I could not understand how a company like prestige can manufacture such a noisy appliance.,3
6345,Poor product from a well known brand.,"My mixer grinder broke within a month of using it.
First the Juicer jar cover broke while it was in use and all the particles got mixed with my milkshake. Next the grinder knob (black) attached to the blades chipped while grinding chutney. Next the white blades of the mixer where we attach it's jars broke and now I cannot use the mixer at all.",1
6346,Don't depend on the warranty when you buy this product,Inalsa is good always we are using this brand more than 20 years and taken so many work without any trouble but this time sound of motor is little bit loud in this model and one big wet grinding jar should be with it other is ok and if you want to bye this is good product Kanwarjit Singh Rajouri Garden,1
6347,Hectic Product because of fault in zar,"I like the model but I didn't received any warranty card only the manual is there, but than too it is not stamped. Pls send the another stamped manual or pls send any customer service agent to do stamping on my manual book. Thank u",3
6348,Very very bad product.,"After 2 days...motor stopped working..and now what shud i do with the features !!
Worst experience..Loss of money.. Again we have to wait for 4 days until the authorised mechanic from prestige arrives and check out the fault😡😠😠",1
6349,Worked only 5-6 times,"Amazon package seal not appear and already opened parcel replaced and defects product, at a time all spares not arranged correct position in parcel cotton box, parcel is damaged",1
6350,Dangerous design issues,Product is not as expected because there is too much noise and it's very very irritating and due to so much of noise it looks as if it's refurbished..grinding quality is also not up to the mark... First time bad experience from Amazon,1
6351,The most dull blades,"I have bought two if the mixer's from Amazon,they stopped working in 5th month. Never buy a mixer from Amazon. Even though it has warranty it is legit to ask for the item to work 15 months at least without hitting service station.",1
6352,Average Product,I loved this product I am using this since three years and I did not find any difficulty till date. I use all the jars ad experience is good.,3
6353,Material quality is very bad,"It’s a good one, quite a powerful motor it grinds well even spices. The flip side though is it’s noisy. Also the lid on the smallest jar does not close airtight and spills around at times when there is need to add water to the items being ground. May be it’s the washer around the jar that is not doing it’s job as intended. The rest of the jars are good. The plus point is it also came with a juicer jar which is very useful.",3
6354,If you want to buy then try this product,The coupler (gear) of main unit (mixer) is tilted (one side up & another side down) and therefore coupler of both main unit & mixer jars got completely damaged after only single use. I replaced the order on the next day of delivery but again I got similar mixer with the same issue (coupler tilted).,4
6355,Product not as described,The product/ mixer and grinder received was found to be a defective one. The seller seems to have chosen to send a probably rejected piece. So much so that we are scared of asking for a replacement.We feel we have made a mistake in choosing the product.,1
6356,Grinder review,"Very bad quality grinding wheel ,I had just opened and realized the grinding wheel is damaged and not fixing properly .seriously don't buy this product .I don't feel like buying any product online now which shows replacement instead of return .Although Amazon has the best customer care policy ,but not this replacement one .",4
6357,Can be used for 6 months,Too noisy but I don't know how other would sound at this price point but if you are looking for price point of view you can pick this undoubtedly,3
6358,Coupler detached on first run. Bad build quality.,I started using recently and realized it's chutney jar & juice jar are too bad to get desired outcome. Lots of chutney ingredients remain uncrushed. If possible pls help in getting exchange with some good quality mixer grinder. .pls assist.,1
6359,Missed allinged jar,"Reputed brand, good packing, good quality. Chutney jar should have been with handle like Preethi mixers as it is little hard to fix",1
6360,Worst product,"I gifted the product to my elderly mother. On 1st December, 2020 I went to visit her and I opened the sealed pack containing mixer grinder. But unfortunately I found that the Mixer grinder was not functioning at all. As the product is found defective immediately after opening I am to request you to replace the item as early as possible.",1
6361,Nice buy,"Purpose of buying juicer is not accomplished.Its not agood juicer,unable to extract juices of Apples etc.Money gone in drain as it's unable to extract juice even 1glass at a time.Old style of juicer was good.I want a replacement with old style juicer or refund.",5
6362,Prestige Iris(750 Watt) Mixer Grinder with 3 Stainless Steel Jar is a good product,""" DON'T BUY IF NO SERVICE, NO PRESTIGE PRODUCTS ""
Don't buy because Prestige not providing Service if your product is in warranty also.
I have registered a complaint 1 month back and not even the company person contact me till Date. All most I have contacted 10 to 15 times and also I have mail the company about problem. But No reply.
Only for Name sake Prestige is giving warranty. ""NO SERVICE, NO PRESTIGE PRODUCTS ""
So don't buy this Prestige products.",4
6363,Quality is bad,"The product is not at all good. The plastic used on the body is very light and flimsy. The switch too moves while operating. Upon seeing the product my first impression was whether it was a genuine product ar a clever fake. I would not recommend anybody to buy it, feel like the product is heavily downgraded to keep the end price low. Have lost faith both on Prestige as well as on Amazon.",1
6364,Worst service from prestige,First time I m very disappointed with Amazon. I received my mixer 25 December 2020 and first time I used it 4 January 2021 and I feel its too much noisy and not working well. It looks like a old machine in a new packaging. Next day I want to return it but according to their terms time out .......but still I m trying. Very bad experience,1
6365,loss of money,"Worst product. The machine broke down within a month after use. Although of 2 year Prestige warranty their services are not good. They didn't even care to respond to customer despite of calling them multiple times. Bad Bad experience.

Recommendation: Don't buy it! Don't waste your hard earned money on this. product.",1
6366,Don't buy it,"Its a heavy duty mixer, Its been one year and still I am using it and I didn't find a single problem. Very powerful product, you should definitely go for it.",1
6367,quality not so good,"Stopped working in one month due to some overload issue. Later , technician helped to make me understand there is over load button to be pressed . It resumed functioning",2
6368,Poor,"Worst product do not buy after 10-15 days it will start
Creating issue jars doesnt fit properly even if it fits still it will create issue. Design defect in product specilly fitting of jars",1
6369,Poor quality product,"After purchasing 2 months, it stops working,
Customer care does not pick the call most of the time.
this product is under warranty, still, customer care person is telling me you to you have to pay for the services.
It's better to go to any shop and purses, rather than purchases from online.",1
6370,It's a Good Product. No Damages / broken,"If you are thinking to buy this product take my suggestion and don't buy it I bought it before 4 months and it's mottor is not working properly and vibrating so high that's why I complaint so many time but till date I didn't get services from that side so it's totally money wastage to buy it

So don't buy it",5
6371,Didn't work.,The material quality dissapointed me a lot. The plastic was of very low quality. The sound was comparatively less and the jars are of decent quality.,1
6372,Worst product - Extremely cheap quality Item.,"I was delivered this product on 25th Feb 2020 and its motor burned on 12th May 2020, couldn't even survive for 3 months. Literally, smoke was coming out of it. I advise all buyers to refrain from buying this product. Just not worth the money. Choose a better brand. Completely disappointed with the product quality. Prestige has to ""prestige"" in this case.",1
6373,Great ONE,"Product is working with repeated complaints in all three
Jars and get serviced for three times. In this month motor of the mixie has changed in the company's service center. On the next day of the replacement of the motor smoke and sparking shows in the inside of the mixie.
I have a dout that this product is a genuine or a second class product.
Kindly do not market this type of product and harass the customers.",5
6374,Not satisfied,The Juicer has completely stopped working and the cup bushes keep deteriorating. The sound of the mixer is getting heavy day by day and as mentioned it doesn't have a very good usage. It is usable only for a minimal purpose. All the blades are not very great and it does not serve the purpose of a mixer.,2
6375,good but some issue in it,"Smaller jar, it is very difficult to fix and remove it from mixer. It does not have handle for easy handling. Also mixer and jar fitting is very tight.

Other Jars are ok.

Very BAD Design....",4
6376,Good but juicer can be much better,"Grinding power is OK. But small jar blade is not grinding properly... Due to blade design.
Last 8 years we used preethi blue leaf.
When compare with preethi, performance is slightly different. OK for this cost",3
6377,wish master was rude..,"I got a damaged product. juicer jar is in broken condition when I unbox it.Also I felt a quality issue in all the items in the package.All the jars have dirt in it ,may be occurred at the time of production and even it is not cleaned before packing.The same product selling in shop having good quality.I am suspecting they compromised in quality for lower rates.",4
6378,Good in range 2549 RS Oct 2019,I bought one year extended warranty card of onesite for small appliances and Amazon it self gives 2 year warranty so including both it should be 3 year that is upto 2022 but after registration of one year extended warranty card it's show extended from 2020 to 2021 it's shows that amzone have given 1 year warranty or onesit is not in proper information about 2 year warranty so please clear this,4

6380,Worst Product,"I have been using this product from last 18 months. Had to call the service engineer 3 times. Jar quality and the built quality is not good. It's making lot of noise. today the blade has broken while preparing the chutney. I have never seem broken blade for a small to medium use.

Not a product up to Prestige standard,",1

Go for good mixer.
Without one star, not able to write review
That's wise given",4
6382,Good budget mixer grinder in this price range,Noise is more than a 500 Watt mixers...it's obvious because of its 750 Watt motor....price and warranty are competitive....still working good....after two months..,4
6383,Difficult to clean,"Had few issues as below hence had to return:-
1. The small jar blade was not effective as compared to my old preethi mixer
2. Loud noise

Grinding is not effective, Specially smallest jar is totally waste , You require lot of effort just to Grind Coriander leaf or coconut cutney. I would suggest plz go for better product don't Blindly trust Prestige Name.",1
6388,The worst product,"Horrible experience, Firstly it does not help grinding Batter, Masala other powders. Secondly its a long wait to get your issue resolved as the customer service does not respond on email. A big Zero for the Seller and the product.",1
6389,Think before u choose,The product is not good for chutney making and juicing as the product is designed having two blunt blade in small jar that not able to make chutney.,3
6390,Worst quality,"I will not recommend you to buy this product.
Just after 60 days its coil burn and not working now.
It generate Too much noise while working.",1

6395,Low quality blades,I bought this mixer just 4 months back ( sep 2020) but now the motor got some problem it makes a noise while grinding and not grinding properly waste of money and time very poor quality,1
6396,Poor jar quality,"With a month the start button when faulty and machin is not working, if I get an option to rate zero I will do that, never ever by items from cloudtail seller they r selling fake products",1
6397,Not Worth to Buy ! Loud machine sound.,"i won't recommend it if you want a durable sturdy mixer .
Product is not durable at all even i doubt if amazon has provided real prestige mixer or not .
just in 3 months two of its rotater got broke without any harsh usage .
i have no idea where to complain about it .",1
6398,Please use good plastic materials for making products.,The rotating knob broken. the warrenty center mention in warranty book is far from home. it will cost more in travel than local repair. they should provide home service like other company. it is poor qyality plastic which broken .,1
6399,Weste product,"Everything is just so AWESOME about this mixer grinder. 750 watt it is... Does quite tough grinding,leaves us to a satisfactory conclusion. Thank You, Prestige Iris.",1
6400,Disgusting disappointed with the brand,Works well as stated in the product details on the seller page. It really is a good product for a middle class family.,1
6401,Very poor quality product from Prestige,"Money always matter, but in this range its best.
Oeople are giving review with some expectations. Its a budget mixture which work great for daily. Vut if you want fancy product plz purchase any higher version around 5000 or above.
Using it for long tine its great but dnt compare it with any mixture in 5000range",1
6402,Worst product wastage of money,The small jar does not grind chutney of small quantities... only if the jar is full it gives good grinding... first when I purchased iris mixie the regulator worked only at 1 speed. 2 and 3 did not work. Currently im using replaced product in this also . Where jar when half full not grinding properly.. go for preethi guys if u r looking for a good mixer.,1
6403,Excellent serviece,"Easy to use..noise level is not high..its ok..jar steel quality is ok...juicer jar quality is not good..i found some breaked plastic pieces..very bad quality juicer jar...except juicer jar all mixer is good in affordable price.
Very bad packing..the box was open from one side",1
6404,Used to harass elders,"This was the wrost product i ever use
we use this product once then tere is some technical issues in Grinder after replacing it there again technical issues on it. Not a good product by prestige.
I hope the pristige company give us original and satisfied products to the costumes but it's wrong.
Thankyou",1
6405,"Good product, not so great","Its the worst product ever
I have been calling the prestige service centre to complaint about the product and they do not even bother to get back and resolve the issue
It's only 2 months now after purchasing it and i have already made 2 complaints...for every complaint they take minimum 2 -3 weeks to resolve",3
6406,"What's product warranty..since most of the jar, mixer plastic holders broken",The quality of jars cap is a very poor quality plastic. One of the cap was broken at the time of delivery. Since it is urgently required by me I did not return it.,4
6407,Okay Okay - Not the best.,The blade spindle gets damaged at the mating portion. It had to be replaced after 3/4 days of use under warranty & again after 2/3 months. The manufacturer has to improve the blade spindle design/quality of material. The mixer is noisy.,3
6408,Not up to the mark.,"The steel is of cheap quality, the grinder doesnt work properly, leaves a lot of lumps when grinding food items with high water content (eg. Tomatoes), the juicer is less than useless.
Can't believe it's a genuine Prestige product.",2
6409,Good,"Product is good but didn't find much difference between this 750watt mixer and 500watt mixer. Design, look, machine material is good. Main drawback I found is noise level. Even though it's new mixer, noise level is so loud as compared to my 10yrs old mixer. Rest all things good.",5
6410,Value for money,"Mixer jar is not work properly.......I purchased this product it is my worst experience with prestige...I want to replace if possible..
Juicer jar is totally ghatiya........not using only single time this juicer added only for product rate high but not working.......I m totally disappointed with this product 😔",4
6411,Worst Product,"I bought this Prestige Mixie in March; it was used for just two months, since I was travelling all of June. The Blades are already malfunctioning... It s a real chore trying to avail of the warranty; I have absolutely no idea how to get amazon to rectify it, or how to send a message to Prestige ; anyone with suggestions, please message back !",1
6412,It's good,Everything is ok.. but Amazon need some improvements in packing section.. why because I don't like particular this products packaging..,4
6413,Sound is like sitting inside the motor... horrible surround sound,This is the worth product I have seen. Not expected from prestige. There is lot of noise when it's operated. In single use the grinding wheel damage. Grinding wheel melted on single use. Material quality is terrible. You can seen in attached image. I wish Amazon will returned the product.,3
6414,Jar leaking...,"Amazon Review: i m not happy with amazon bcoz the product is not packed in Amazon box Why amazon is not boxed packed Only one Stricker of amazon on the box.

Product Reviews: Noise level is little bit higher other than Good product. I recommend to all buy this product and ignore bad Reviews.",1
6415,Worth Purchasing!,I bought this 3 months back. Its not working now and the servive center also not responding properly. VERY WORST PRODUCT FROM PRRSTIGE. Dont buy this product.,4
6416,waste of money,"Dear sir,

Used the product (wet grinding jar and small container jar) last Sunday and grinding is not fine, it is very coarse. Our coconut curries are usually very fine and did not have any problem with other mixers. Hence not satisfied with this mixer. Request replacement.

Regards
Neeta",1
6417,Design of juicer filter locking system is odd not user friendly,"Delivered on 26 Oct and it stopped working today that is 21 Nov. Not even worked for a month.
Really disappointed with Amazon for the first time.. honestly don't buy expensive electronic things guys.... expecting Amazon to help on this ...it really disappointing becoz product did not even worked for a month.",1
6418,Mixer grinder stoped working,"Product is good . But noise level is very loude . All jar is good with lead. Blead sharp . Jucer jar is good . Amazon delivery is also good .
Mixture grinder body material is plastic . Not good . There is no light indication on mixture . Warranty 2 year .
Grand all type of thing.
And prize is under 3000 is good
Over all its good product value for money",1
6419,Faulty set supplied,the motor is very powerful. but the jar should b more powerful to support such jerk given by the motor. overall in few seconds it grinds whatever you want to with no hassle.,1
6420,Please don't buy it .,"I bought this mixing 4 months ago and the problem arrived now. After showing to the mechanic he shows the duplicate motor which was installed in the machine by the manufacturer.

I strongly recommend not to buy electronic items through online",1
6421,Mixi got lot of problem after using 6 months,"This is a horrible product. within 4 months, the motor started making noise and started giving burning smell. then finally after sparks came up, it stopped working. never expected such a low quality product from TTK.

Would strongly suggest that you do not go for this product. It's a waste of money.",1
6422,"Within 3 months, it stopped working",This is worst product from Prestige.. don't buy it.. as it is noisy and smelly.. also the screws they put inside the mixer cup.,1
6423,Doesn't grind properly,Leaking jars...2 jars were leaking from the bottom.I went for a replacement and that was worser.All jars were leaking from bottom.The juicer leaks from top as well.I finally returned the second one and got refund.,1
6424,Perfect piece at perfect price at perfect shopping platform,"The blades are too close to the bottom metal thereby restricting grinding of whatever you put in the mixer. I tried with multiple veggies, lentils, soaked rice, but the machine did not respond well. Wont recommend, not even on sale.",5
6425,Performance is too low,I bought this 1 year ago. Two jar’s blades spinner part is broken. Quality of the spinner part at the bottom of jars is very bad because I had another mixer grinder before this one which lasted many years.,1
6426,Fine 3/5,I used this product for just 1 day and immediately the motor was burnt and I could see fire burning inside the unit. I want this product replaced. Please help me to get it replaced! 10 days replacement window expired only yesterday. Please help! Can we expect replacement against this?,3
6427,Very very bad. Disappointed,"Burnt power cord in first week, second week jar blade came off during usage, called technician for the same issue of jar 4 times and they are not able to fix a jar and still the complaint is open after 2 weeks and even customer care doesn't have answers. Please don't buy this product and waste money on this brand.",1
6428,Not worthy,Noise level is too high. Don't buy this product. The material used to manufacture is very cheap. I doubt it's not prestige product. Don't buy this product And they don't even replace or refund once u get it.the blades are too loose and not of good quality,3
6429,Long lasting with variety of components,"It's good product.noise is not so harsh not so silent.it makes the mixture , smooth texture in minutes.cleaning is also easy iam using it from an year ,no repairs.",4
6430,Pathetic build quality,"I didn't see any minor issue during usage but its chatny is a bit small, it sometimes overflows the mixture. It says use at most 5min at atime because of moter survival so keep in mind its precaution then you can take advantages of it otherwise you will complain of it...overall good.",1
6431,FAKE PRODUCT - Does not FUNCTION,"I bought it on 5th October, Model IRIS and its not even one month the Speed adjustment knob is not functioning .
Its quiet pathetic that a BIG company like PRESTIGE is supplying an inferior product .
I have filed a complaint for refund of the amount.
Also the Noise is too high and not user friendly
Don't ever buy this product",1
6432,Lid broke with ice cubes | Cold coffee damaged jar cap,"Writing review after using it for almost 4 months. Overall the product is good, easy to use and clean. Performance is also good, value for money. However, I did not like the juicer design, tough I have not used the user yet but seeing its design I believe it won't give good result.",1
6433,Worst product by prestige,"Product ius of sub quality. After it is used the jar is getting jammed on the machine and very difficult to remove. The jars are of light weight and noise level too much. Overall very bad product. We thought Prestige is a Co. producing quality product. Any how, we cant do anything as date of return is over.",1
6434,Ok,Don't buy it...spinner comes out within usage of few months...and then they don't listen to ur complaints... No technician will arrive to fix ur problem...I would suggest not to buy any product from this brand.,5
6435,Waste of money,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Am got the product with defective on grinding wheel.....

It's too poor quality maintain by seller and prestige company.... Plug pin too damage.. after replacement",2
6436,Disappointed,I think company quality control testers are not serious about their job.. As it's motor assembly is not proper I can see bush in slots.. And motor a little bit tilted...,1
6437,Bad product. Do not grind well,"Product delivered nicely without any damages or scratches on it,

Performance is good working good,
All four jars are very useful,

At this price it is a good product to spend.",1
6438,Don't even think about buying this,"Bought this product to gift a friend. It is good for daily bases, i guess. Well, overall good n affordable.",1
6439,2,"Super fast motor 750 wattage,
I'm racamended to get the low price
Performance wise really good product
No damage issues, 2 day delivery
Very nice product",3
6440,Bang for bucks,The product came in with everything intact. It comes with 2 years motor warranty as well. Have been using it for a week now. Will need to wait n see if any issues crop up as it's too early to comment.,5
6441,Duplicate product.. don't buy.. not working,"The Product is Very Good As I Ordered Keeping The Brand Name While Ordering. I Would Recommend If The User Can Afford 3K Should Order This Prestige Mixer Grinder It is Worth The Money You Spend. 750 Watts, It Is Easy to Clean, Easy to Use and Noise Level Is Not Much.",1
6442,Technical fault resolved,Everything was good and fine. Seems like it was used by someone before. Seals were open. Poor transportion of the product. There are unusual paint marks inside as shown in images.,4
6443,Noisy Machine,I have purchased this item sometime back.. mixer grinder are working fine but juicer provided in this is not working.. its cutting the fruit instead of extracting juice. I think its manufacturing defect. could anyone plz tell me how can the get the juicer only changed? by calling at customer care or is there any other way,3
6444,Not satisfied at all,"There is lot of noise when operated.there is burning smell from the machine. I wish it is returned or replacement done, Even with out load also, always switching off. Very disappointed.not even able to make coconut chutney",1
6445,Bad Quality be Vessels,"This is the worst product, from the first week its giving trouble, I taken it 2 times for repair , we can't even grind juice in this , the spinner is coming out each time u put for grinding , such a worst product ,my suggestion don't go for online purchase, product quality is very vary very very poor",2
6446,Not satisfied and not worth it,"Worst ever product from Amazon..
It doesn't grind even a fruit.. very much disappointed. Really really waste of money.. would have bought in shops instead of online..
I have compromised the quality by seeing price.. Dear friends don't make the same mistake by getting it.. buy it somewhere.",1
6447,One of wrost product I ever received from amazon,Life of this mixer 2 years max. Too noisy. After 2 years it stopped working for me. Buy some better brand.,1
6448,"Damaged, not working perfectly. Kindly replace","The company has used very low quality turbine wheel that is not so strong (picture attached), hence it breaks after sometime and total grinding function stop. It is happens with me within guarantee period. It is a betrayal. I request to amazan to delist the prestige company.",1
6449,Updated review : Grinding not properly,"1. Juicer jar lid leaks sometimes.
2. Noise level is more
3. Operating knob design could be made better and more grippy

Overall ok with the product after using for few months.",1
6450,DO NOT BUY,The products knob stopped working wihin a week of purchase. Customer service by the brand is pathetic and very poor. Would not recommend this product.,1
6451,Good,"Highly recommended product..low noise,easy to use,but little bit difficult to clean...
Totally very good product and package was very nice....thanku Amazon....",4
6452,Worst product don't buy it.,Its not grinding properly. couldn't get fine powder for the dry ingredients. Even its not completely grinding the tomatoes. Waste of money. overall rating for this product i will give is only 2,1
6453,Fake product,"Have purchased a mixi last 26th, the beauty is amazon had given replacement option within 10 days, but the product broken on 14th day while it was using. It is not even 5 days I must have used the mixi. Do you have any further options for the replacement or refund. I think I must have bought this in shops directly.",1
6454,Poor quality of product delivered,"Worst mixer grinder even though it is 750watts not at all grinding properly, heavy noise, full burning smell, just for 5minutes use it gets heated, and it is tough to remove or unlock the jar after grinding it gets stucked, and the 4th jar juicer is of no use.",1
6455,Neat Features,after use of 10 days after my review they mentioned it produce 70 to 90 db sound during operation is correct but over all finishing of jar and blade are not good and speed controlled switch also loosened....this is a special edition for online ..this product does not meet our fulfillment and quality ...,3
6456,Poor assembly of machine,"It's not even 1 month and already the power knob is not working at speed setting 1. Extremely noisy and the blades and so dull, it takes for ever to grind the dosa batter to the desired consistency.
I regret buying this pathetic mixie.",2
6457,"DO NOT BUY prestige any more, sell defective products online.",Don’t know what to comment on this..I believed in prestige products all time this turned out to be damp squib. The product stopped functioning after 20 days. There were sparks inside the mixer and also getting shock while operating. Also couldn’t get the product repaired due to the Corona lockdown.,1
6458,Best mixer grinder,The worst ever product. I have ever seen. Pls don’t look after only positive reviews. This is real time review posting on 13/05/2020. Jars blades are not grinding and mixie upper fan is melting. Speed adjuster nob is coming in hands. For everything photo is uploaded. Pls don’t buy this.,5
6459,"Cheap quality, bad knob not easy to clean blade design","Such a big brand in India as well as International level, they are complete fail in mixture grinder line of products, Grinding well since this grinder have a 750 Watt motor, but also produse a high sound, can hear next 3-4 rooms also upstairs, not recommended for a Flat/ Studio rooms.",3
6460,Worst Service of Amazon,"Worst product do not buy this. First time I received a defected product, then returned and it was replaced with a new one. That was frequently having complaints, so we took it to a service center, from there they told that the mixi is all made by assembling old parts. I want a refund.",1
6461,Very bad product.worst we can say,"Material quality is good , easy to use ,medium noise level. Sometimes it's smells like burning while operation. It's having 750W motor but while load it's shutsoff automatically,we have to press load button again & again to start mixer. Buy if and if you use on interval days and with less operation not for heavy use.",1
6462,Awesome product,"When I opened immediately to top cover, firstly we can find the jar cap and immediately i notice that jar cap had been broken. secondly there was bad smell like chalk power over all the jars, I did not know what was the reason. I request all to wash jars before using it.",5
6463,Worst product,"After using 4-5 times, it stop working.
Then the servicing from Prestige is very bad. The servicing customer care do not have any control over the field engineer. I call three times to customer care, but till the engineer not visit.
Please do not by any Prestige product, the service is very poor.",1
6464,Worst product and service of Prestige,Very nice product. I loved its new now its working good lets see in the coming days how it goes. We usually doubt abr the discount but its actually truei got this product at the half rate dan mentioned in the product. Would definetly suggest others to purchase this,1
6465,Best for Indian Housewife,"The product has stopped working 6th time in 6 months. The engineers who visit are not capable enough. Customer service is horrible and makes you feel that they are obliging you by giving service. Most of the times you book a complain and nothing happens since they fail to track complaint number... In short, buy this product and be ready to be on long duration futile calls with ill-behaved Prestige customer service.",5
6466,Worth buying - Review after 1 month,"Absolutely pathetic product. I bought this in July and by October the motor switch has stopped working.

I'm going to try reaching the customer care. Will update on what happens.",5
6467,Poor quality from prestige,"Looks good but doesn't grinds even tomotao3s or onions well. One can find pieces of these after grinding even after 15 min.
Pls add a few more bucks and go from better brands....am stuck :(",2
6468,Fake Prestige product,Used and Damage product delivered. Didn't expected from Amazon for delivering defective products to their customers....pic of mixture grider clear shown that is used and defective. Amazon must check the product before delivering to their customers... Quality check should be there...I am not happy at all,1
6469,Great mixer and juicer,"Product is genuine but platic quality of juicer , specially juicer is not good.

Additionally due to improper packing I think product is bit damaged .Got few platic pieces in box it self ,which was actually brocken pieces from machine.",5
6470,Motor failed within 2 weeks of purchase. Very poor quality never ever buy prestige mixers.,"We bought prestige mixie recently

6471,Worst overload protector.,"I received the mixer why was broken inside, its grips were broken both in the mixer and a jar. All i understood is that the plastic used in this is of low quality.
Worst is Amazon does not have option for return but instead asking for a call and that too does not go through",2
6472,Not recomendate to buy.....,Had done lot of research on products available in the market. This is the right product with a balance of price vs performance. Go for it.,1
6473,Poor products and services for defected products.,"I received the product on 26 October, and used it only 5 times now the chutney jar and dry grinder jar is not working and I received it with no small cap of wet grinder jar.And the juicer white attachment is stuck up.purchased it for the brand name but a very bitter experience,what should be done now,will it be replaced",1

6477,with in 20 days jar base damaged and motor is firing smell,It's been a month since I started using this mixer grinder.. it's one of the best in this price range. Value for money!,1
6478,Prestige mixer grinder,Not sure about the market price however the mixer is really very good. Even the containers are strong and lids are also sturdy. In lockdown my old mixer stopped working and hence I brought this one. Worth buying,5
6479,Uff treble,"Vest product I never seen. Just for 2 months mixi has repair

Don't expect premium quality.
For this cost it is ok.
Jars are not thicker as I expected.

Will review later after use.",1

6484,Needed ruff n ruff working but it's fail in 6 months only,"The customer service is pathetic. I had lodged a complaint that I am not able to use it as the speed knob is not working, but even after 15 days and 3 reminder calls no body from the company has come.

When the customer service is pathetic even a good product turns useless.",1
6485,Nice,"After getting this Product, I have seen that wet grinder zar is leaking as soon as i started to use. Not good product because of the faults.",5
6486,Average.,"The product is worst quality. The smallest one already broken, medium one is taking more time,many times motor got stuck with the base machine. Worst ever quality I have purchased. Brand name Prestige has shown wastage of money",4
6487,Not for heavy usage,Waste of money.. stopped working after a few days. Couldn't even complain with Amazon as opened it after a few months of buying this product.,3
6488,They should replace the motor when i have invoice copy with me.,The mixer simply doesn't work. The spindle in the middle is delivered completely out of sync. The chutney jar jumped and dangerously flew away few feet. Returned.,1
6489,"Sent us an old product, thought we wouldn't notice",The blades on this product are so dull that it can't even grind simple green chilli properly. Thought there was a problem with my unit and had it replaced but the replacement also had the same problem. Pathetic piece of device. not expected from a company like prestige.,1
6490,Good product,"Even though it is a 750 watts mixer , not grinding coconut, tamarind properly. Making chutney is not easy. Not able to remove the blades as well. Cleaning is not convenient. Average product. Packaging was good. I got it for around Rs 2800/-.",4
6491,QUALITY,Material quality is really very bad. Very delicate material of rotators. Jars quality is also not standard. Got bit damaged lid for one of the jars. Please Prestige try to maintain quality standards.,1

6501,Perfect.... With some imperfection...,"When I first ordered and used that product, the coupler of the mixer was struck with the jar and came out.

6503,I love it,"The investment made on this product is wasted, the blend speed is low, the blending capacity is low.

Mixer grinder used only once from the day of receipt and in that use itself it started heating up within 1 min which was very abnormal. Product is of below standard or poor quality.,1
6508,Poooor Quality of plastic and noisy..DO NOT BUY,"I m writing this review After using it more than a month, . Noise level is high but it's okay some times you can ignore it. Looks wise so classy.

6815,Good product but got busted in few days,It's just awesome. But I think it's a used one product because one stand of the Machine was broken and there were dust and some other particles looks like someone has used it before. Other wise it is ok.,2
6816,Noisy,Quite a noisy mixie compared with other Prestige models. With all the jars it is same decibel level. May be 100 plus. May be I am unlucky with this piece or all Iris make same noise!,3

7069,Review after an year,Not upto the prestige quality as expected. Jars are not long lasting. Very flimsy and brittle plastic parts which break easily,4
7070,Good product for Beginners.,"Brilliant product

Most of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDD

My base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make sense

Second requirement was SSD. I needed anything at or beyond 256 GB

Third requirement was latest generation of processor, 10th Gen in this case

Fourth requirement that kind of became mandatory after I was doing the diligence was MS Office preinstalled. Again, why go for aftermarket installation. Note: lot of people complain that this is only for 30 days. That's not the case. I activated just by signing in and updating Office.

The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera. With all the online classes and office, you can't look like crap just because you have a camera dating back to 2000s. All else are either expensive, do not have SSD, do not have 8 GB RAM or MS Office.

The screen could have been better, but I have a 29 inch LG screen so no complaints.

I missed checking if the swivel opens 180 degrees and this laptop doesn't open 180 degrees, so if you do use dual monitor then you have to place adjacent to additional monitor

Very satisfied till now. Boot time with SSD is awesome, the system boots in under 10 seconds.

Although it says 1.47 kg it feels a tad heavier. I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.

I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C type

This is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy",5
7071,Grabbed at Lowest Price,First got the product delivered couple of days late. It worked fine for 1 week and then all of a sudden screen is gone ! Poor response from HP service centre ... they are saying screen must be physically damaged which is not the case at all and there after no update from last 3 days after constant follow ups ! So I cant use laptop anymore just 1 week after buying it! Poor Quality and worst service By Hp support !!!!!!!,5
7072,Got a refurbished product 😡,"I've been using it for 3-4 days now. Experience wise it's great. It gets your work done.
I'm not a gamer so can't comment on its gaming performance.
Pros:
8GB RAM helps windows 10 experience a lot.
Light Weight.
I don't consume storage space on my laptop so 256GB SSD is more than enough.
Boots in less than 10 seconds
Windows 10 & Office Student lifetime Subscription is a huge plus too
Cons:
The looks are pathetic.
The display is very very very BAD
Plastic Body, Heck Plastic Trackpad feels very cheap.

If you are able to make compromises on the cons then It's an average buy. Okay to use for work & study.
Gets things done. I think it's the only 8GB product under 40K.
Let's see .. I will update this review in a few months if the product still exists till then.",1

Trackpad- Average but for long usage one should rely on External mouse
Speaker: Does the job perfectly for a laptop both in call quality and infotainment
Charger: 65w adapter will charge 0-100 in 2 hours time
Battery Backup: with 100% Cpu usage can expect 4-5 hours anything with 50%-80% Cpu usage can expect 6-7 hours as mentioned in description

Comclusion: For office / commercial user who require emails and Ms office online classes & infotainment mutitasking of 4 at a time can close your eyes to buy",5

7079,Outstanding DSLR for beginners!,"Super product by HP. Got this HP 14s cf3047tu at Rs 35990 on great indian sale. Awesome Performance! Writing this review after 1 week of usage... Here is the detailed review of the product..

Battery backup is impressive. If you are not a heavy user it can last for a day. ( 9/10 )

Performance wise it's a beast.. with 8GB of ram, i3 10th gen processor and SSD storage you will not face any problem related to speed and performance. Windows boots in just 6-7 seconds. The software or apps takes max of 3 seconds to load... I have not faced any lagging issue till now. ( just avoid high end softwares and games and your laptop will work like a charm ) (10/10 )

Display is also good... I don't know why people are complaining about it. Also bezels are not too thick as in dell vostro and others. (8/10)

Looks are also decent with patterned surface which feels amazing to fingers and also provides a good grip. (8/10)

Sound is AWESOME! at 100% volume it feels like i am playing music over a Speaker... It is really loud. You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.
You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price. Really! (10/10)

Camera is Average or you can say good for video calling purposes... As you don't have to take selfies with it.

So finally, This laptop is good in every feature. A power packed machine by HP. You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price. Better than vivobook 14, vostro and ideapad series. Just Go For It!
Overall rating 9/10.

(you also get a lifetime version of MS Office 2019 home & student - powerpoint, word, excel & one note which comes preinstalled with it that is you just have to sign in with ms account in any of the application and you will unlock the office suit)

Also a big thanks to Amazon. They delivered it within 2 days of ordering.

- vivek 😊",5
7080,Pls dont buy seller is giving defective lens,Good and affordable system from HP. The system come with loaded windows 10 and MS office. Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent. The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food,1
7081,Canon 1500d is the best camera,"Before buying this product please make sure you this. We have decided to buy this product the first ever problem was it was enabled to connect with router and second thing it get's hang frequently which only brought before a month. We have consulted the hp services they are were will be responsible of ntg as you brought it from Amazon. If we consult this Amazon these people are asking us to contact hp people. 35,000 matters it not 10 for our middle class people. Even if like have any exchange these would allow choose any options. Please before buying any electronic goods make sure that the company and also refund policy are good otherwise there would be lot of problems to be faced just like did",5
7082,Nice picuture quality but not good for night photo,"Its just around 10 days since we bought the laptop. Today as we were working it showed ""HDD 3FO Error"" on bootup.
On BIOS tool it says storage volume is not present!!!
Have raised an issue with HP for technician visit. Hope they could solve it!!!
Not sure it is an one off problem or general issue with this model.",4
7083,Very nice product .I am happy with my camera 1500d,"This is the worst product ever. DO NOT BUY.

I bought this laptop in Sep 2020 and the laptop stopped working within one month. Amazon is refusing to take return and replace this product.

For the past 2 months I’m trying to get the laptop fixed through HP service. Most pathetic service. They close the tickets immediately without resolving the issue. Despite repeated requests, they are not sending technician to fix the issue.

Getting no warranty support or technical support.",5
7084,Good one for beginners,"Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storage
It boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students.
Cons: Not so good webcam
And marks on the laptop when
we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INR
OVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP.",5
7085,Worth it 👍,"# 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal..
# laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage.
# Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it..
# Lag free windows 10 experience
# Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it.
# Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point.
# Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it..
# Has got a good sound quality.",5
7086,WHY NOT TO BUY EOS 1500D,"This isn't review after 3 days of Use.
Pros: Very thin and light.
Easy to carry
Battery backup is good 5-6hrs
Boots up in less than 10secs and b
shutdown in less than 3secs
8gb ram+256ssd makes the laptop super
smooth and fast.
Sound output is good.
Cons: Camera is average. Not Very great.
No backlit keyboard.
Track pad could have been more smooth
but a mouse will do the work.

Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range. Best for students, office use, etc.

7087,MindBlowing,"Purchased this as replacement for my aged HP ProBook 440G1. Replaced an i7 with this i3 option for these reasons: Latest technology -11 Gen, 2021 model, SSD, 8GB RAM. Did not want to spend a lot as I have a Surface Pro. Got 12k in exchange for the 440G1. So this fit all the bills. First impression of product is good. Plastic feel was the only putoff, but you can't expect a metallic body at this price. Laptop doesn't feel very sturdy for the plastic body. Booting / Shutdown is very fast because of SSD. 8GB RAM is min required for decent Windows 10 performance. Screen resolution is good. Very lightweight so you will not mind it carrying around. Easy to activate both windows and MS Office with instructions given on product page in Amazon. Overall, a decent product that won't dent a hole in your pocket. Would have given 4 star had the body been metallic and sturdier.",5
7088,First day of purchase Disappointed!!,"Worth the investment. Got this with an exchange offer and got it for 30k. Great for business and home use. Not recommended for games or heavy duty data processing works.

1. Light weight
2. Quick bootup thanks to SSD.
3. Mat finish, keyboard quality is great
4. MS office 2019 comes free
5. Audio quality is above average
6. Video streaming and display is quite good
7. RAM can be upgradable up to 16gb but may have to let go 4k *2 rams DIIMs
8. Hard drive cannot be expandable, need to replace.",1
7089,Awesome 👍,The product which we received was really bad. Problem was faced with WiFi connectivity. Initially it get connected with WiFi and then automatically get disconnected.,5
7090,Budget camera and amazing picture quality,"Writing this review after 1 month of usage.
Purchased for 36k and here are few observations:
(I am not a tech guy, but who use laptop for regular day to day usage)
- Installation can be done by self and not required to avail the Amazon service at additional cost.
- Ideal for School/college students/ regular users with not much of technical work to do.
- Not ideal for Gaming purposes.
- Decent booting speed & No hanging issues encountered so far
- Video streaming apps load decently, the streaming quality is Okayish.
- No keypad light available.",5
7091,Battery cap was not found inside the box.,"Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.
After exchange, I got it at 32k.
At this price, it's more than I expected.
Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs. I even run VMs with 2 core. I don't want to launch 3-4 VMs so that's reasonable for me.
SSD and 8GB is very quick and smooth operations.
Genuine Windows and Office is a plus. One less thing to worry about.
Last, Amazon is very good that it got delivered same day...",4
7092,Just go for it..,"Amazing speed, at first I had issues with start menu response but later fixed by update. Only laptop in the range with 8Gb ram. Keyboard is perfect as the button's stiffness is well manged. Very light and almost negligible bezels. Only problem is the display which is HD and not FHD, although resolution doesn't make much difference but the inaccurate colour reproduntion and lack of Antiglare coting makes it an average display. Battery life is 6hrs + once full, charging is fine alomost 2 hrs. Overall I cant find a better laptop in this range.",5
7093,Canon EOS 1500 D camera.. already registered with the manufacturer two and a half months back.,"After 1 month of use,
1. display is blinking
2. and bios boot issue appeared.
3. Power button doesn't work some times... You need to hold for seconds
4. Only advantage of this laptop is thin and fast boot due to ssd.
5. Least quality Graphics

6. My final advice is... Go for different models.. This is built with least quality material. And motherboard doesn't support even small applications... Dell inspiron models are seems best as I used it earlier.",5
7094,Best for beginners,"After going around shopping at shops for a 8 GB Ram +SSD +i3 11 gen specs I met very high quotes and low spec config models from various popular brands.Finally this purchase met all my expectations and fit my tight 40k budget.Windows+office was a bonus, highly recommend.",5
7095,Good Camera but no external mic port and non returnable,"Its been a week , so far so good. Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.
Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) .",5
7096,"For the beginner, Canon 1500D is a perfect choice.","Review is for the 10th gen i3 - 2 core model laptop
Pros
Compact size / weight to carry around.
Windows 10 Home for life time.
Office 10 (I guess that is only Word, PowerPoint and Excel) but for single user .
Has Ethernet LAN connectivity (newer models do not have this).
8 GB RAM (contrary to the 4 GB mentioned on HP site for this model) which will give good performance .
256 GB SSD storage, improves speed and handles shocks.

Cons
A little reflective screen.
No DVD drive.
Both the legacy USB Connectors as well as Power Supply connector are on Right hand side while 1 USB .
Type C USB connector is on left hand side.
Wifi speeds are only upto 150 Mbps, though YouTube streaming experience was good without any lag.",5
7097,Good entry level camera.,"In less than a month, the laptop failed while in operation. The SSD hdd is not accessible although the diagnostics indicate the disk is fine. From the reviews, it appears the laptop model has inherent problem & hence should be called back by hp and replaced with functional/tested models. Other features like light weight & thickness are overridden due to these failures leading to data loss.",4
7098,Canon EOS 1500d Buying Guide Review,"Bought this laptop during about 3 weeks ago during the Navratri sale offer. Delivery was quite prompt, got it properly packaged the very next day.

Usage wise quite satisfied. Battery backup is also good.

Regarding display, am satisfied for regular googling / reading, even watching a movie is decent. Screen was not very clear during a Zoom call.

So overall am quite happy with this laptop for regular use.",4
7099,Given point not support extra flash and triggers,"The laptop is really nice for its price, but the screen is pretty reflective just like mobile screens.
THERE IS NO antireflective/ antiglare coating on the screen as mentioned here on amazon.
Now if a reflective screen is not an issue with you go for it.
As for me its very problematic as i usually work in well lit room, and i will have to get used to it and sit on places away from windows and bulbs on the back and sides.",1
7100,CANON eos 1500D,"It is better product for those who have the budget under 40000, its processing Power excellent. Startup 10to15 seconds. 8k videos are run comfortably. Battery backup upto 4-5hours. Mice good. Speakers excellent. Overall performance good. I suggest it for the students who require laptop. Only the problem is that there are only two USB ports , should have been three.",5
7101,Best entry level DSLR.,"Got it in a good price with exchange. Coming to the features it's a 2021 model with 11th gen i3, suitable for most day to day tasks. I use it mostly for logging to remote work machine. Can use it for light to medium level programming. Camera quality is fine for zoom calls. Speaker looses clarity at full volume. Battery gives around 2-2.5 hrs average backup when I used for video calls and its self discharging if laptop is not used for long. Keyboard and trackpad are the worst, always use a external mouse and keyboard combo. It has 2 USB 3.0, 1 hdmi, 1 USB type C, 3.5 mm ports. So need to judiciously use them or buy an external USB adapter. Overall good buy if you get a great deal on the price.",5
7102,JUST AWESOME,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Within a month of purchasing this product, the trackpad started heating up (attached is a video). When contacted the HP customer service team, they were so casual about this, saying - ""you are lucky that the battery was not affected otherwise it would have melted and caught on fire"". When asked how did this even happen with a brand new laptop, we were informed - ""electronic hai kuch bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai""

And the best part is that HP's warranty does not cover burns and battery melts. Lack of safety for consumers, and accountability of a low-quality product sums up our experience of the HP brand.",5
7103,Must buy,"Bought for my son, he didn't want it, I landed up using it. Exceeded expectation considering it is only a core i3. The included Windows 10 boots fast in about 10 to 12 secs. Standard application like Microsoft Words, excel, chrome, edge etc runs without any lag. installed MX Linux as a dual boot and it runs very very fast without any issue, in fact it boots to desktop in about 6 to 7 secs. The laptop is well suited for normal computing needs. Gaming haven't tried. At 34k price point it is a value for money product. Recommended.",5
7104,Perfect Amateur Camera,"Look no further if your budget is 36K, close your eyes and buy it. 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD and I3 10th Gen with MS OFFICE-License configuration you won't get it anywhere else. It boots in just 5 Sec with super fast performance. Initial Setup is very easy and you can do it yourself. Also if you follow Video uploaded by seller, registering MS OFFICE License is also easy. Display and Camera is ok (not best). Speakers are loud and clear. Overall a great buy.",5
7105,Good for beginners.,"Mine is a I3 11th Gen 256GB SSD Version. Boots up within 6 seconds. Has a great full HD screen so working on documents and reading texts is a breeze. But it is a shiny screen so not an antiglare. Comes with a lifetime version of office so you are covered there. You just need to activate it Camera is good for a laptop considering it is used for video conferencing only and not for clicking selfies or landscapes. Handles multiple tabs in browsers and HD videos smoothly. Wifi connectivity is good, catches signal 2 rooms away. Speakers are loud and clear and upward facing so you wouldn't need external ones for video calls. Battery life is great too. Gets 4 hours with streaming.
2 USB ports are placed next to each other so connecting 2 thick USB drives simultaneously may not be possible. Also got a USB C port for those new age connectors.
Laptop body has a textured surface so maintenance is easy. It is very light so handling is easy. But the keyboard and touchpad could have been better. Keypad feels bit flimsy and childish, touchpad has a wiggle room and not as tight it should be. Hinge is wider and stretches from end to end so should last longer than those old models with 2 split ones that used to break easily. Looks like HP was able to save costs only by compromising on the build as you don't find another laptop with this config in this price. I only hope that the keypad and the hinge last as long as the laptop as I don't see any other weak points in this laptop.
If your usage is limited to your kids online classes, browsing and MS office, just close your eyes and buy this.",4
7106,Very good product if u dont waana record super audio,It's a pathetic product. Very bad build quality looks fragile. Never expected such kind of product from HP that is too through Amazon. The quality is highly detoriated and.when I am asking for the return through refund Amazon Customer Care people are giving absurd policy reference. I am contemplating on approaching the Consumer Court for the redressal of the issue.,5
7107,Not for studio photography,"Overall experience is good as expected. Performance is mind blowing I just bought this laptop for coding and personal works. This is only products with 10gen ssd and 8 gb ram within 40k range. I am using HP laptop for 8 years that's why I chose HP laptop only. Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.

Booting speed: 4.5/5
Camera: 4/5
display: 3.5/5
lightweight: 5/5
charging: 5/5
battery backup: 4.5/5
overall: 4.5/5",4
7108,Amazing Camera,"Speed is fast. Very quick boot time.
Build is average. But performance was very good after initial 3-4 days of usage.

Need to have Microsoft account in order to activate the laptop first time. Also it's required to activate the MS office product which comes pre installed with laptop.

If you have opted for old laptop in exchange then delivery might get delayed as in my case they could not arrange and it got delayed by 2 days.

But overall experience with laptop is good. Battery back up satisfactory. At least for 4-5 hours. Camera quality is average. Sound is good. Since it's ssd, much faster than traditional hdd.",5
7109,Did not satisfied,If you can overlook the build quality the rest of the laptop is absolutely stunning. It is a complete value for money I tested rendering a 4K video of a 20 minute clip and it was able to render it just 7 minutes. Aa it few 50gb raw files and Photoshop was able to handle it just fine. Eleventh generation chip has 3.8 GB graphics that is sufficient for day 2 day work and edit. The trackpad is flimsy but strangely very accurate and gets the job done.,1
7110,Useless with basic lens provided,"I have been using this device for almost 3 months. For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well. This laptop has some good compromises for the price. No backlight keyboard but a good, comfortable keyboard. No FHD display but a decent battery life. The SSD speeds are pretty fast as well. So a fast boot up. Speakers are also decent.
Overall, I use it everyday for work and no problems till now.",5
7111,Good for beginners if get in correct price.,"This is an amazing product for liye coders. Who are noob in coding they can try this lappy.

SSD- because of ssd the timing of loading am operation and opening the os is little faster.

RAM 8GB- 8 GB ram is enough for specific coders. It is good for multitasking. But don't try this if you are a heavy gamer or heavy coder.

KEYBOARD- keyboard is greally good. Easy for typing but there is no numpad.

TOUCHPAD- a fine and smooth touchpad with mat finish which is appreciatable.

Screen- Full hd and 14 inch. You may find it a little small but still it is very much clear.

OS - windows 10 is preloaded in SSD. Therefore the machine is faster than others.

MS OFFICE- ms office is also preloaded. You need not to buy or download it.

HARD DISK- 1 TB hard disk is there.

LAN PORT- LAN port is given.

USB PORT- only 2 USB port at your right side.

SD CARD PORT- available at left side.

CHARGING POINT- at your right side.

HEADPHONE POINT- at your right side.

CAMERA- camera is quiet okay for normal video calling.

KEYLIGHT- Keyboard light is not available.

Battery- you can use it up to 6 hrs.

All over you can buy this if you are a lite coder. But not recommended to heavy gamer or coder.",5
7112,Good Camera for Beginners.,"I bought this laptop for my kids for online classes. But seems I can also do my office work using it. You cannot get better than this under 35k with good brand name.
Pros:
1. Thin & Very light weight
2. Very fast processing and no heating
3. Build is good in this price range
Cons:
1. No anti-glare screen",4
7113,Worth for Money,"I wanted to use it for freelance Writing purpose. And it's working fine. Laptop boots within 7 seconds because of SSD.

I use many tabs at a time, 6-7 at least and it's giving fine performance. There's no slag in the system.

Screen is fine too. Even in brightness, it works fine.
Antiglare lets you stare at it for as long as you can work. No strain on eyes.

Audio is superb. It's better than I thought. Realtek audio gives a solid sound and home theater like feeling.

Value for money.

Recommended for people using it for freelance writing work, office work or students.",5
7114,Awesome camera,"I m writing this review after using for about nearly two months . So i bought hp i3 8th gen 8g 256gb ssd model . Im a college student casual user only for powerpoint and browsing only i decided to go for it .
Basically i was using old model of hp laptop only with amd old processor which gave lot of problems i cannot able to use that for simple one. I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.
This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:
- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.
-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.
-Also keyboard also it good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine. it necessary to wireless keyboard .
-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .

These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.
Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.
Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.
Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.
FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.
Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it . other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.
U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.",5
7115,Very bad service experience,"Bought this HP laptop last year in Oct'2020. Twice it crashed completely & we lost the data. Than the company replaced the SSD drive mentioning some issue with the same some wherein Jan' 2021.

Ever since than the laptop is unbelievably slow. My 6 year old laptop works faster than this one.

We placed complaint to HP but no response.

Very poor manufacturing, in all probability these HP laptops are seconds & have manufacturing defects. They are selling them online & washing their hands off.

Not advisable. As a matter of fact we will never buy any HP products in future.",3
7116,Best budget dslr for everyone,"What the hell this laptop is
Worst laptop
Never ever dream to buy this waste
It automatically starts burning when charger was pluged in and got fully burnt
Got dead within one month of purchase
No support from hp",5
7117,"Nikon 3400 is better if you get in cheap price. I got canon 1500d for ₹21,990 on sale.","Super value for money. At around 40k, it has all the features for a neat laptop. Boot is super fast due to the SSD. The HD space could have been more, but 250 is ok. Screen is amazing and liked the resolution' pictures are crystal clear, Camera is ok; sound is good enuf

Only improvement area could be the track pad buttons; since it is within the pad and not outside, looks lil flimsy ... hopefully it not wear out

On the whole, a good system for day to day use ...",4
7118,Worth the money.,"Best laptop with great specifications:
8 GB RAM/256GB SSD.
Battery life: More than 6 hours make it more valuable
Sound Quailty is amazing. No need of extra speaker

Could be more better:
Display (view angle not that ,much impressive)
Keyboard Quality should improve with metallic finish instead of low quality plastic (On this prize segment, it makes complete sense)",4
7119,Just Go for Nikon3500D in this price range!,Product description does not mention anything about screen resolution. If you blindly expect a Full HD screen you will end up having a a semi HD screen.,2
7120,"Amazing clearity, original image without effects","Ok the DSLR Giant Canon have launched 1 more entry level DSLR. Actually i bought this camera for my friend. Does this camera worth 31K. Lets see

PROS
1. Its easy to use
2. Decent battery backup
3. Live mode operation is not lagging.

CONS
1. While focusing the DSLR is making too much noise and its the kind of annoying that u will lose interest in taking photos.
2. No shortcut or assigned button to change F stop (aperture). A manufacturer who is keeping dedicated button for changing the ISO have to thing about the importance of aperture.
3. You can't change the focusing point by pressing the round dial in the system, if u press it some other setup will open up.
4. The output image quality is actually not mind blowing.
5. White balance- Use it if u want to take risk
6. Main issue. If u use camera flash to snap a pic during focusing it will flicker like anything and it will annoy and irritate the subject
7. Noise Noise Noise. Whatever low ISO you use noise will b there and when i went to service center to ask about this they were saying use a prime lens to get good output.
I am a Nikon user i have Nikon D3400. I compared both cameras by taking same images with same settings in manual mode. The output from Nikon is better than Canon 1500D.
In one word if want to push photography to next level from using a Point and Shoot or mobile camera to DSLR Or to learn the whole DSLR setting go for it (only with a mindset to change the camera in 1 or 2 years). As canon accessories are comparatively less costly than Nikon it wont create hole in ur pocket.

I am not biased towards Nikon, i wrote wat i felt.
Its not worth for money",5
7121,Nice product!,Good camera for beginners.,5
7122,Great Camera,"Great camera. Perfect product for young budding photographer..... Useful for in-house, nature, functions, and spare time photography. Take high quality pics, videos , portrait, landscape wildlife, nature pics etc",5
7123,Great camera for beginners!,"Really impressed with Amazon surprise for delivering within the 2 nd day from ordered Really packing was excellent and the quality of the material is awesome love to control the camera from mobile through Wi-Fi easy to connect, best one for taking self photos and group pics also the quality of canon speaks everything dont go for any oscillation beginners blindly got for it",4
7124,"No hot shoe, cannot use third party flash","You are on your own if you buy this product because canon local service center is of no help even in providing the product demo. We logged the complain on canon India site and not bothered to reply. Amazon call raised its hand saying ""proof of non service"" from local service center. So we have a DSLR that is producing blur images and canon is not providing any proper service. stay away",2
7125,Amazing Camera.. Go for it.,"Request for replacement of camera main body There is lot of blackspot/blackness automatically appears in View finder mirror just after 15 days.

They must deliver that as soon as possible.Otheewise I gave to complain about it again & again.",5
7127,Used before 4 month and Real review for you all you can trust,"Auto focus is not at all perfect.
Minimum aperture is 4.5, so dont expect much in portrait.
While focusing manually there is a play for the lense(18-55 mm) so that there is a chance for getting missing ur focus even though if ur made it correctly.
Easy to operate compared to Nikkon models.
Fast moving subjects cannot be captured as expected due to its poor auto focus performance. It take about 3 to 6 seconds to focus in internal lighting conditions and it fail to focus several times in dim lights.
Plastic quality is poor.
I got it for Rs.18599. So that it is a value for money product. Don't go for this model if ur willing to pay about 23k. Better go with Nikkon 5300.",4
7128,Record video Autofocus 1 point only,If you want to upgrade your camera from point and shoot to a dslr then it is a good camera for you but if you want to start videography then don't buy it auto focus of video is too much bad. If you want a camera for videography then go foe canon 200D or Nikon D5600,1
7129,"Easy to use, entry level camera","I am really fully content with the product. It reached me within two days with everything content in it and no doubt in a very good condition. It may be somewhat difficult for the beginners but it will not take a long to learn. If you are choosing between canon and Nikon I will suggest you canon because of its real colour capturing and fine focus of its lenses. You can get more slightly more features in Nikon than canon at the same price but that doesn't mean that will surely better than canon. You can look for contrast between canon and Nikon in the internet. I think it will suggest you the same""canon"".",5
7130,No invoice recieved,"Canon Has Cheated The entire photography community. if you are a photographer and use flash or studio lights this camera is not for you. do not buy external flash and studio ligits like elinchrom and godox will not work. .

reason why i am saying this.

the mount on with the flash is put has one point of contact missing. in 1500d they have removed the main point of contact . 1300d has it. go for 1300d .",3
7131,Good camera.,"Dear friends i buy this camera for my YouTube career😞 and if you’re buying this camera for your YouTube career then its not for you.

This camera only good for pictures clicks!",4
7132,SUPERB TOOLS FOR BEGINNERS!,"I paid Rs 20240 for this product and have read some of the reviews, and I can say I bought it expensive. Some people got it for Rs 18000 in the offer period. I tried some of its features and felt terribly disappointed. The autofocus is a joke here. It takes forever to click a photo in just slightest low light. I was very annoyed. I feel like I should have bought a cyber shot instead. Nikon D3500 is way better than it hands down in terms of clarity of photographs, quality, ISO, battery, grip and display. However, you'll have to pay Rs 3000-4000 more, but that's worth it. You don't buy DSLRs every day. Choose a better camera.",3

7135,Awesome product at an awesome price,"Got dual lens with body in just 28K with SBI MASTERCARD. EXACTLY HALF OF SHOWROOM PRICE.
Too early to comment.
Excellent delivery within 2 days.
I can say it is best for beginners with more natural photos than NIKON
Pros:
Handy
Easy to use
Best blur with 55-250 lens
Various modes
Natural Colour
Fast autofocus
Best fit for beginners

Cons:
Lack of touchscreen (Look at the price)
Bluetooth is not available
You can't operate your Camera after connecting with smartphone.
No WiFi connectivity is available with laptops.
Suffer a bit at low light.

Overall it is best for beginners and even upto semi pro level!!!!",5
7136,Best entry level DSLR,The camera is in good condition...I have received the charger and the battery but it doesn't charge the battery....charger received is faulty..don't know how to go about it....as really frustrated ..there is no return policy also....,5
7137,Good for beginners but creating problems with flash,"Thanks to amazon and the courier partner for the quick delivery. Well it was an awesome deal from amazon purchased it for around ₹21.5k with a free gift Motorola wired headphone worth ₹650.
Coming to the camera it’s a great learning camera especially for the beginners who love photography and also want themselves to enhance here. My personal experience after using it for a week for now with the combination of shutter speed,aperture and ISO with a desired white balance you can be click practically any of the desired picture that you want to click.

The camera comes with a 18-55 lens that is self acclaimed for beginners. Do master your parameters with this lens then you can obviously go for desired range of lens available in the market.

The only shortcoming that I personally found was the focus which need to be adjusted manually/you need to have patience while clicking raw pictures. But this is again not a shortcoming for sure this is the area you need to improve yourself over the camera.",1
7138,Very MC SELLER,"It's a best entry level DSLR camera if you have used only point and shoot or mobile. It has built in guide which makes it easier to use and learn. The auto focus and pictures quality is also very good but some time in low lit situations it generates noiy in pictures for that use extra flash other wise best. Videos are also very good for blogging video use manual focus which is very eyes to use with best results. It's better than Nikon d3500 as videos, auto focus and features are better in this camera. If your budget is limited and you are new in DSLR then it's a must buy.",1
7139,"Genuine ,safe & faster delivery","This may be a good camera for the very experienced professional of photography. It is challenging for a newcomer in photography.
1-Flash Makes too much noise
2-You cannot record a good quality of sound because it does not support any external mice.
3-This camera does not support any audio jack for recording sound.
4-Wifi does not control the video recording function
5-No Bluetooth connection could be established with other devices.
6-This camera is manufactured recently, but it does not have recent audio jack.
7-They are using very old audio jack technology. If the external audio jack is compatible, then canon should give the one connectin cable and audio jack which complies with the camera, but unfortunately, the camera does not provide it.

Thus it is concluded it is an outdated product is dumped in the Indian market through Amazon platform.
if canon disprove me, I will remove this product review or update it",5
7140,My first DSLR,"Amazon was dispatched this camera on 08.10.2019 at home and i went to some official trip on that time hence i was not able to check its operation. I came home on 23.10.2019 and opened this product, captured some images and it was good. Later i tried to transfer the images from Camera to mobile through Wifi and found the camera getting switched off. I tried several times and the problem remain same. Further i tried to return the camera and the seller is not accepting my request as the date of return is already crossed.

I have contacted my friends who is working in photo studio regarding this and they have expressed that the Canon EOS 1500D is having such types of problem and we have seen many of the cameras having such problems.

We request buyers who is willing to buy this product, pls avoid online purchases of this product. Verify before purchasing.

Now i request Amazon to help us regarding this issue.",4
7141,Best for Beginners - Nice picture quality,"First of all thanks Amazon for giving such a wonderful offer , my dream comes true and finally I have dslr....Picture quite is awesome in both day light as well as low light. Still learning the different modes of camera for taking pictures. For beginners it's little difficult to handle but there is an auto mode that can be used if you don't understand anything. But quality of pic comes better when you set the camera manually",4
7142,Best camera for begineers !,"I have purchased this for my brother last year from Amazon.
I got the single kit. slightly disappointed due to that. Otherwise....
*Excellent DSLR for beginners.
*Easy to use.
*Good quality.
*Decent battery backup.
*Worth for money

Fact: If your expectations are high with the stabilization or photo output etc then please go for Canon 5D/7D. This is for beginners (21K) and so if you buy this then keep your expectations as much you pay. :p :)",5
7143,Best buy from a budget of Rs.25000-30000,"I had only 3 hours to make the decision. Next day I had my flight to Korea and we thought of buying a DSLR at night (didn't make a decision earlier, as we had One+ and iPhone which are kind of best in class for the camera). So, I quickly did research and found just 3-4 options. I watched 2-3 YouTube videos to make the final call and guess what I made the right choice. I took next day morning delivery paying 50 rs extra. The camera is superb (5 stars). Though I handled a Sony camera earlier, this is my first DSLR and believe me, it was quite easy to follow their instructions manual. I would highly recommend you to read the manual / try at home/rehearsal before you go out to capture actual pictures. I am attaching a few pics which I captured with just 2 hours of the experiment.",5
7144,Not user friendly.,"Let me explain.

Yes, with 9 point AF with the OVF, you'll feel the AF a bit dated but does the job rather well. Live view has face detect but has a jerky continuous AF and is slow.

But those are most of its negatives.

The camera takes wonderful pictures and with digic 4+ image processor, the jpegs are perfectly usable. If you want perfection, shooting in RAW will give you what you need.

The colors captured on this camera are perfect and natural, with settings to tweak them to your taste (see picture settings in menu).

The build quality is solid and ergonomics of the camera, especially through its grip is wonderful. It feels perfect in my hands. The menu system is uncluttered and quite intuitive. It is very easy to customize the camera to your specific needs.

You can shoot videos with this camera but without continuous AF, you'll get better results if you switch to manual focus during video.

Why is it the best DSLR?
Because of it's limitations in AF and simple straightforward usability it lets you take control over your photographs and videos unlike other advanced models which take control away from you and makes the choices for you. The result is you can get the exact photograph you intended to take. Combined with the 24 megapixel sensor, which is the same sensor found in almost all other canon APSC DSLRs, all the way upto 80D, the image quality is at par with much more expensive cameras.

The digic 4+ processor is good for image processing, frankly the more advanced processors bring features such as 4K and such, which if you're not into video, you'll not miss it. The digic 4+ processor is more than adequate for your photography needs.

With all the above considerations, it's the best DSLR you could get, in my opinion.",1
7145,Missing camera bag and memory card in the box,The battery is faulty .... It drains even when not in use,1
7146,Loved the product and the service,"WARRANTY CAN BE REGISTERED!! IT HAS 2 YRS WARRANTY!!!

7147,Affordable camera for any beginner,Picture quality fantastic and camera handling and features are very good which will attract a beginner.,5
7148,About camera,This amazon playing very cheap games to the customers. I have ordered this product on 29th for almost 29k and now the sale daybits cost around 23k. How fooling the customers for this kind of false pricings and every product has 10days return policy but now its not acceptable reurns it accepts only replacement. What a cheap gameplay amazon. If you really think about the customer do some promising thing not such kind of fraud things. Never ever i buyer in amazon again. Good bye. You lost a loyal customer. I may not do anything for you except stop ordering from you. That enough to added advantage to your competitors.,5
7149,Better At this price range Canon 1500D,I wanted to return this order on the same day and purchase Canon 200D as I did not like it.. but never had an option to do that. Tried contacting CX care a number times and nobody were of any help to me. Atlease got a chance to ask for assistance regarding the return. I still have it packed as it is.. I am not at all happy with the product and have not even charged the battery even once.,5

1.amazing picture quality
2. Handy
3.light weight
4.gripping is good
5. Best features with WiFi and nfc,can transfer images directly to phone or pc.
6. Memory card and one battery is included

Cons:
1. Camera carrying bag is small
2. No extra battery with package you have buy extra one for backup
3. Don't come with screen protector, you have to buy it for LCD display protection from scratches.",5
7152,Superb entry level DSLR,"I bought this camera, its was working well with 18-55 lens, but when i move to 55-255 the performance was low.
battery backup also very less.
But overall good camera. At night 55-255 lens take hell alot time to focus.
So my suggestion is go for 200D. Amazon wont refund for it, so i sell the camera on OLX",5
7153,Value for money,Delivery boy not calling for pick up the product as I returned the item,5
7154,Best Beginners Camera...,"# DSLR at feasible price

7155,Must read,"First of all. I ordered this product in Amazon great sale at 34000, but next day the price was 30000. I am very disappointed with it. Camera is for beginners, who wants to learn about basic photography. It's for casual use. If you want a proper professional camera for photography, then I would suggest go for 70d or further.",4
7156,Good Product,It's a great product but the price fluctuates between 24k to 30.5 k which is a big difference.I have even found PPL buying it for 20.5 k .So please wait for the offers to make it a real value for money deal.The add on lens should come with more affordable packages.,5
7157,Go for it,"The product is absolutely perfect but Amazon service is not professional. Don't buy this if you are going to shoot videos bcoz it doesn't support mic, Amazon will not tell you this in their description of product. I lost my 10k because of Amazon they mention ""10 days returnable"" but it is actually ""10 day exchangeable"". They totally denied to take it back. Be careful when you are buying it.",5
7158,Good,"Camera is gud one..... But i brought it on 'no cost emi (970.86)' of 6months @25376.14 after the deduction of 970.86. Now my EMI is 4391.16 for 6months...that comes 26346.96...

So my question is how will i get the no cost benefit of 970.86?",5
7159,Canon EOS 1500D 24.1 Digital SLR Camera (Black),This camera is only for photography ...u can't record a good video... because it doesn't have continuous autofocus while video recording....even mobile phones have that function.... the auto focus is fixed while video recording...like if u move in your video..then u get out of focus...which is disgusting.. because video means a movie a moving object...,5
7160,Night mode not good,"I have purchased this Canon DSLR after a small research. It's results were fantastic as a digital camera. But just after few months of purchase I found that sometimes it's shutter starts operating automatically without clicking any picture. Sometimes it worked ok but sometimes automatically opening and closing of shutter with annoying noice started. Then I contacted Canon serice centre. They gave me address of local service centre at Jabalpur MP. I gave them my camera for repairing. They sent it to Indore city workshop and it took nearly one and half month to return me. It was working ok at that time but after few days that shutter problem started again.
Now I can not give this camera to workshop again and again so I am using this faulty camera as sometimes it works ok but sometimes it doesn't work due to shutter problem.
I thought earlier that Canon was excellent brand but now my thinking is totally changed about it.",1
7161,CANON EOS 1500D,"This is my first camera. The pictures are great. Video quality is acceptable for such a mid level cost. The images are high resolution and good even in low light. Same for videos.
For beginners like me,it takes a few weeks just to learn various settings like auto and manual focus. Aperture and shutter.. and ISO...

Youtube is very useful for first time user to get familiar with the settings.

The seller was very nice. Delivery was good and product was authentic,as always!

The quality is good with free bag and a 16 GB sd card,but had to buy 128 gb as 16 gb is low space for a camera that takes high resolution images and videos.

Just go for it.",5
7162,Basics of photography,"This is my first DSLR. I will mention few points below which i liked and sumthing i didnt liked.
LIKED:
1) Its good for day time photography
2) its lightweight
3) Its good for normal photography
4) 55 - 250mm lens very good for bokey effect

DISLIKED:
1) Kit lens not so good
2) Flash too bright
3) Night time photo not good.
4) Quality feels average
5) photo quality average",5
7163,Best for learning photography,"Candid pics, excellent picture clarity best in this price you can't ask for more. Great cam for first DSLR folks.
The disappointment is only with the Courier service, have been very pathetic service with Amazon delivery and it's been so worst since a couple of months recently. Amazon should rethink of the Courier partner. Will be a big drawback with this worst way of the delivery service .",4
7164,For Beginners and Enthusiastic People,This is a review about the seller ... Please think twice before you purchase anything from this seller ... The camera I had recieved was not seal packed ... It had a tape to give the illusion... And the camera had a very very light scratch on the screen and these were some of the red alerts and bingo there came the real issue ... The menu button was faulty ...,4
7165,Best in the business !,"For beginners this is a great option
Go for it if you are learning basics of photography
Image quality is decent
Low light photography you have to control on own
Rest all covered",5
7166,Memory card,Canon 1500 is the best entry level DSLR and its very easy and convenient to use..the canon connect app is jst superb.. u dnt have to worry abt transfering the pics from the memory card..jst connect the DSLR through its inbuilt wifi to ur smartphone and jst view or download any pic..save it in ur phone..laptop... u can also view and click from ur smartphone..this is the best function of the camera..the DSLR works well even in low light..i have tried clicking pics without using flash..and they came out superb..images are crisp and there is no issue of the pixelisation..day time images are superb no doubt..,1
7167,Worth IT,I used it only 4 or 5 times till now and it’s not working properly.i was thinking that it might be setting problem but no it’s not a setting problem when I press the click button it stuck and on the screen it always show busy or error. I got frustrated when I pick it up for clicking pictures. With this problem first I have to switched it off and then on then it work only for 1 click after it again it show busy and the click button not work even I m not able to press it . It gets jam all the time.kindly do the needful bcz it’s in still warranty.,5
7168,Good product.,"Pictures taken with basic lens. Full zoom. Manual mode. Retouched on iph 11. Small size here. Real pix r lifelike. Happy with purchase. Canon website is extremely bad designed n thr s bo straightforward way 2 update warranty like lenovo. Wrote them a mail attaching invoice, no acknowledgement nothing. Camera is good, hopefully won't have to visit service center in 2 years. For any problem check youtube videos. Ths s my 1st n only DSLR. D performance of a camera s not in words bt in its pictures. ₹23.5k.

OF COURSE THE INVOICE NUMBER BY APPARIO DOWNLOADED HERE FROM PRODUCT PAGE WAS DECLARED INVALID INVOICE NUMBER BY CANON INDIA WARRANTY PAGE.",5
7169,My dream purchase.,"I need to return or replace the Product, as it was not informed to me by canon or amazon that Canon EOS1500D has the hot shoe which has only 4 points not the main 5th one, thus it does not support the studio lights by trigger.

Being a genuine customer, visited whole Mumbai city to buy its adopter, but not available before asking Amazon & Canon to return or replace the product, but they simply getting away by saying Return Window is closed...not fair",5
7170,Very good Camera,"I have bought this for product photography but I am strange that this is totally worst camera result that I never seen after 1 year of usage, There is autofocus issue in the camera, this camera does not taking autofocus for all the products at a time.

I have tried so many times and lots of option wise selection also, but these is totally waste of money camera if you purchase it for autofocusing facility.

Please do not buy these camera , as it is totally waste of money, nothing else.",5
7171,Very nice product using for YouTubers,"This one is....I bought this camera for clicking my pictures for Instagram... and this one is amazing...my insta feed is full of awesome picture,reel and video...if you want to know final result then go check out my Instagram...",5
7172,"Authentic, value for money","I'm using this camera from past 6 months and I will recommend this product to beginners if they get it at around 20k.
You can get great photos using it.
To improve quality of photos even more, 50mm prime lens is recommended.
Added benefit is having wifi and NFC to easily transfer your photos to share it with world
Although don't buy it for making videos.

I have added some photos that clicked using it for you to see.",5
7173,"Awesome product, amazing quality, canon rocks","Great product, I naught this 1 day before my family trip. Had no professional photography experience still the pictures were perfect (through auto mode)

Have been exploring the features for while now and if a beginner is looking for phone then this is must have.

I ordered for only 1 lens and now I regret the decision as the 55-250 lens is very costly if naught separately. Would suggest anyone to go for both lenses if the budget permits. Though the 18-55 lens is just fine but if you need to zoom more then not much helpful.",5
7174,No Invoice Provided,"M writing this review after usage of 1.5 years of canon1500D:-

The camera is good - only for new comers into photography.. If you’re a photographer who does paid shoot or is interested in various amounts of genre in photography then I suggest to go with a lil high budget of another camera. This camera is good only with 50MM lens.. if you click pictures with the 18-55 MM lens then you are gonna definitely face issues with Noise in the picture.. same if you use 55-250 there is a high chance if getting shaken images also adding noise into it..if u have budget issues and are very good with post processing skills then you can go for it or else not..

Overall:-

Picture Quality:- 3
Auto Focus:- 4
Battery life:- 5",4
7175,Pretty good camera,"If you just want to start DSLR Photography but at the same time a bit confused which model to buy , don't think twice go for EOS 1500D . First of all I would like to clear any some doubts .
1.You will get your DSLR Shoulder bag with your camera .
2.The Kit lens is 18-55 II lens
3.The memory card you get with the package can give you the speed hoto 48mbps . If you want good SDHC Memory card you can go for Sandisk 32 gb or Higher . It will give you a speed of 90mbps.
4.You will get a diopter adjustment dial just at the right side of the optical view finder.
5.Screen brightness at level 4 is probably enough for everyone , where you can extend the lcd brightness hoto 8th level . You van guess how much bright it's actually . Easy for outdoors also.

👉 It's a bit noisy when you shoot in low light , so try to keep atleast minimum light source near your object . Try to keep ISO minimum , change your shutter speed , keep it at 1/10 or lower if the condition outside is too much dark .
The price for which I got these is around 24000 . At this amazing price you are getting a branded DSLR which is basically for beginners , so you may have some complaints about the stuff but believe me it's probably the best option out there with a huge range of modes and operations. Go and grab it, start your experiments with your frames 😊😊😊 .",4
7176,Wow scintillating picture quality,The product was delivered in less than 8 hours. Thanks to Amazon Prime. The product was deliveded in good condition with all accessories as mentioned on Amazon. I'm a new user for DSLr and this camera is very easy to use there are most commonly used modes typebfor photography and it comes really handy. Picture quality and resulting is good for a enter level DSLR,5
7177,Satisfactory level for beginners,"This is my first camera and I'm extremely happy with my choice. It is just the right DSLR for a beginner. The displayed instruction for every function helps you to navigate yourself through them. Within a day or two you will know everything about it. It has a really fast auto focus and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. Being a beginner, I feel that I couldn't have chosen a better one.",4
7178,Just replace the Bag with Original Bag in the return period.,I am using this for couple of months. In this model Canon has removed the center pin in Hot Shoe. Hence most of cheaper after market external Speedlight flashes cannot be used in this DSLR model. Very few models can be used which are TTL capable - but those are above 4K INR. So anyone looking to buy this please be prepared to invest in costly Canon or third party Speedlight Flashes. Inbuilt Flash is of no use.,3
7179,Go to for beginners,"For a DSLR, it is relatively compact, light in weight and easy to operate. Although certainly a step up from a smartphone, it’s just not all that exciting or satisfying to use for anyone with a deep interest in photography. Build quality is good enough to withstand normal usage, although not rough treatment and neither the camera nor the lens is weatherproof. The kit lens is an average performer across its focal length range. I'd recommend paying extra for stabilisation if you add a telephoto lens to the basic package.
It lacks in some features, especially with the 30fps recording, 9-point focus system and the lack of a headphone jack, but if you are into photography, the camera makes up for it with the still great picture quality and amazing battery life for its price. I doubt it would provide the best stepping stone for beginners who want to improve their mastery of photography.",5
7180,I loved this..!,"This is hands down, best entry level camera for regular use. Begin with auto mode (auto focus, auto flash everything auto). Explore and learn slowly on your own or by watching some videos on youtube, and become an expert in no time. Once you become professional, you can be the photographer at your own wedding. All the best",5
7181,Overall good...nice,This is my first ever DSLR and this is been a great experience pictures are so great that I gained a professional confidence that I can click good pictures thanks to cannon for introducing such a great entry level DSLR at this affordable price by Amazone.Battery is also long lasting and very easy to use.i must suggest everyone who is looking for an entry level DSLR please go for this.,4
7182,very good camera as compared to price,"Absolute value for money at 23500 (price I purchased for)

Has a 24 MP lens with the latest in-class sensors and controls and even enhanced options like dioptre corrections. For a beginner it even has a setting with creative filters applied automatically to scene which I find to be useful.",5
7183,Worth Buying. Photography Love. Best Budget DSLR.,"It’s good for a beginner I must say not for the someone who’s looking for more features in a economical price. I wanted a Camera for a purpose of shooting YouTube and small Events. We’ll never mind we all can always have the best with the option of just a click.
Five keys to take away from this experience.
• Best for beginners
• Not very economical for the price
• Amazon has the options needed
• Canon’s playing with it’s good will
• Well, never mind nobody’s going to take it seriously",5
7184,64GB memory card is missing in the contents,"If you need a DSLR and you don't take many photos go for this.

Quality is so good. Auto Focus and other things are sooo good but after 1 year you may feel to go for a higher version if you are so interested with photography.. but very good product for beginners and people who need a DSLR and for ppl who take photos occasionally",3
7185,Highly recommended for Beginners,"It's a great camera and picture quality is really nice.
I can really feel the difference of 24.1MP in photo quality in comparison of photos clicked in my older 18.1MP 1200D camera.
Received a super deal on this during Amazon Great Indian Festival. Big thank you to Amazon for that.",5
7186,Great DsLR,"After using this for 1 week got to know like its perfect for beginners who are at entry level, good autofocus, 24.1 MP CMOS sensor works well better than 3000d, the shutter speed is a bit slow, 3 snaps per second, except that everything is perfect (for beginners)

Lens provided Along with this is not soo good
Use a prime lens and you can do wonders",5
7187,Good camera but bad unfortunately bad merchant.,"Writing the review after a year of use.
I was searching for beginners camera and choose EOS 1500D and bought it at a very valued price during Great Indian sale.
The performance of the camera is stunning and the quality of the pictures is really great. You need to get the basics settings right for a good picture.
I've used it for both indoor and outdoor photoshoots and have got a great output. The battery backup is also long lasting.
If you are looking for a DSLR for beginners I will 100% recommend you this.
Thank you Canon and Amazon.",2
7188,Canon EOS 1500D,Actually I loved this product and ordered as combo offer with tripod+16gb card+ case +uv filter 58mm. Once I placed the order it's split into three separate order and uv filter will be placed an order for 62mm. Again I reach out to CX team and they processed exchange with same item.. now they are telling you are received what you oredered... Not even understand my concern. One major thing I was not received 16gb card along with the camera.. I have tried to get 16gb card with on whole day. But they keep on disconnect the chat on call and said we have to return the whole camera.. when order solit into separate orders why should I return whole things !!! Worst customer service ever and ever...they all rude.,4
7189,Very good product,"The camera is an excellent option for those who are just newly stepping into photography field as it can give them all the tools needed to develop their skills.
Performance as an entry-level camera is good. It has Wifi inbuilt in so the users can transfer their files from the camera to smart devices.. Canon1500D has a superior sensor over the older EOS 1300D Thus, overall image quality is much better. Color saturation is decent and a fair amount of sharpness , As far as noise is concerned, the camera handles shots well up to ISO 1600 with a little amount of grains Even at ISO 800, the noise levels are acceptable. Increasing ISO to 1600 increases the noise but the images were still good enough to be shared on social medias. Autofocus is fast enough when using the viewfinder but once switch to Live View mode and it really struggles to get the focus. Overall i would recommend the camera to anyone who is starting into photography .
Here are a few of my shots clicked using this camera.",5
7190,Additional third party flash can't work on it,"Please see the unboxing photos as attached along with this review. Carefully check before placing orders what you are going to get. Memory card will not be part of this. I found camera bag missing. Also SD card slot does not have the tray/container to insert a SD card, even though you buy a SD card on your own separately. Also see the picture carefully, without lens the camera will look like as shown in the picture. I wanted to capture all accessories included when I got it delivered. Conclusion: amazon FBA is not justifying with customers. Canon original product definitely has all accessories even including SD card I believe. Now I doubt about the quality of packing and condition of the camera, never know it's just an used product got delivered. Moreover, the product does not have refund policy. Be very careful before placing an order.",3
7191,Recommended for amateurs,"Ordered this product for Rs. 21,990/- using Prime on 22.10.2019 at 10:00PM & Received it on the Very Next Morning! Product was Packed Tight Perfectly in Sealed condition.

Box contains: Camera Body, 18-55 Lens, Strap, Battery, Battery Charging Adapter & Wire, Kingston 16GB Memory Card, A Carry Case, Warranty Card and Guide.

Turned it On After mounting the Lens to the body and started to Click Pictures and I must Say The Quality of the Pictures are Damn Great and Amazing. Tried Clicking some Pictures of Potraits, Close Up's and in Flash off Mode and the Results had Awestruck me!

Also Connected the Camera to My Mobile Using WiFi and Canon Camera Connect App from PlayStore as this Product supports WiFi and NFC. Using Remote Access I had Controlled Camera and clicked Few Images and it seemed perfect. WoW

I have Noticed that Autofocus is a Bit Slow. Will talk about this in the later part after proper utilisation.

I Conclude that this is a Must buy Camera for Beginners and Hobby Photographers at a very Reasonable Price.",5
7192,Good product at this price.,"I'm using this product for the past two months here i list some of the good and bad.
Good:
Battery life
Low cost
Image quality
Easy for beginners
Value for money
Wifi share

BAD:
Plastic material body
Less photoshoot options
UI is not up to the mark",4
7193,Amazing camera with breathtaking picture quality,"Bought it for my dad and would recommend it for absolute beginners who want to grow out of mobile photography and get some more out of their clicks.

If are buying this camera, stop shooting in auto mode as auto mode is same as a mobile camera so not worth buying of you'll be shooting auto. Buy a point and shoot instead if you'll just be using auto.

Also buy only for photography, Video recording is garbage and you would be better of recording from a mobile camera.

In short, great for beginner photographers as a first dslr.",5
7194,Okay! Don't expect much!!,"Honest Review: this canon camera is not good for beginners,, better to go for good point and shoot camera or good quality mobile bcoz when you shoot your video this will not give you any auto focus to moving object. So this will just give auto focus to a particular object only and when your object go front and back.. this get automatically blurred in case of video. This is my honest review so don't buy this camera for YouTube video like cooking, art and craft etc. You don't get return and refund so go to shop and try the camera range before buying for your particular purpose. For photography you can buy this. But for video this is the worst camera I ever used. I don't expect such a bad autofocus.. after doing manual focus settings then also this camera will stuck to that particular silent no motion,,, object only. We shoot video for moving things.. so worst buy. 1500d is totally worst for video.",4
7195,About camera,"super camara, picture qulity very clearly, auto focus amazing and beginners go for it blindly...5 star rating overall, very smooth and hendy camara and its lcd display cool and bright also camara easy work and fast photo capture, wife to connect mobile features i like it,. but amazon delivery so late. i order 1/10/2019 and packeg arrived 7/10/2019.. 7 days for wait...not speedy prosses",5
7196,USB cable Camera to PC not supplied with the Camera,"Hi , Just Purchased this Device in Amazon Great Indian festive sale . Camera Quality is Superb . Useful for beginners like me . camera functions are easy you will learn all function in a day or two . Also ordered 50mm lens for the same . Samples attached are taken with 50mm lens.",5
7197,Go for it,"You can take brilliant photos with this camera ( if you know how to use it properly)
Picture quality is nice
Nice auto focus ( suffers during low light)
The smartphone connect app is useful...
Better to buy extra lens.
Kit lens is not that much powerful,but you can take great photos with it,If you want.
Camera is just a tool,it's all about your talent.
Am completely satisfied with this product
Amazon packaging was great,they took serious protective measures.
Thanku Amazon, Canon , The seller and all the persons who brought this item to me.",5
7198,Its a basic camera for beginners.,I bought a canon eos less than a week ago and the shutter stopped working. There is only one official service centre in a big city like Hyderabad and now they say that some liquid has entred they don't do free service as some liquid has entered and it is customer mistake. I did not even use it much and not sure how the liquid entered.,5
7199,Totally worth the money go for it,I did not receive memory card and bag with the camera. Now I am unable to test it. I can see other people have received both items along with the camera. My camera box does not have sticker mentioning the SD card. Canon should have included it.,5
7200,best DSLR around!,"Best for beginner photography. It's been more than 6 months now. I bought this camera with the 18-55 lens for 21k and a 2k debit card discount on top (net: 19k). I have learnt a lot in terms of photography. The continuous shot speed is very less (3 fps) and the autofocus isn't that great but does the job.

For the price this is a value for money camera.

This is a very portable camera. With time you can upgrade your lenses.

If you're are really into photography or want to explore it with a minimal budget this should be your purchase

If you want to check out more photos from this camera and ask any queries personally, check it my Instagram id: @pixelbug_abhi",5
7201,Decent cam with this price range just go for it,"A pretty decent camera not only for beginners but for experienced photography enthusiasts as well. My suggestion to those who are buying their first DSLR- spend a couple of days learning / experimenting the manual mode, you'll have some awesome pictures after that. The bundled lens is good in most of the situations, low light auto-focus could be a bit better. All in all, this is a good camera at this price.",4
7202,Than,"Great DSLR for begeners......amazing quality ant trust of canon
Recomended for all photo enthusist and normal household events and functions.

Good user experience...
Camera bag it came with is not that giod.....recomended to chenage it foe added safty",5
7203,My First DSLR,Everything is okay in this product but i suggest seller to include SD Card and Carry bag because it's difficult to start camera without SD Card. Also bag is required in travelling for Camera safety. Charge extra of this 2 items but next time please give those items included.,5
7204,Great Product to begin your journey in the field of photography✨,"I love this camera...it taught me so much about lighting, shutter speed and angles...plus since it's so cheap I am able to practice more from it without fearing it would breaking it
The colors are natural yet vibrant. It's lovely",4
7205,Top in the entry level.,"Bought from Appario. Two orders and one replacement - seal broken in all three cases so returned the camera. Bought it for 33.5k first and now, with JJ Mehta - it is > 38k. All in 10-15 days time.",5
7206,Not good for regular usage,"Just getting my hands on the new purchase but its really seems to be a Deceptive Trick by CANON or their dealers to show a reduced price..There is NO USB CABLE INCLUDED & NO SD CARD NOT EVEN 16GB ONE. Now it really doesn't take Einstein to understand that anybody who is willing to purchase a cam like this wouldn't care to get a necessary cable/card with it & its just so obvious that we all expect exactly that a cable/card would be included...

So, before buying please do checkout the list of included items carefully...other stars after using the cam.",2
7207,Value for money,Been using this for about a year now and it really works great as a DSLR is supposed to. But just reflecting back on why I bought this camera at this price I think I was better off buying a smartphone with good camera. The camera is good no doubt but the smartphone cameras have also developed alot. So buying this camera for an average person may not be the ideal choice But still it is a good DSLR for it's price. 😊,4
7208,Loving it...!,"Good for Beginners. Using this product for more than year now and working perfectly fine. Purposely did'nt wrote review earlier. Now I can say this product is really good. Amazon delivered in good way.
Recommande to Beginners who are looking for good DSLR.",5
7209,Worth the money,"was very happy for the price that i got at 19,990 during the sale. Camera works well but i did not explore all the options. Hope it's good for beginners to play around.",5
7210,Useful camera,"It's a good camera for beginners.
Update: I found that the mini USB cable was not working. When I registered the camera in canon edge website, I got an option to extend the warranty but it didn't extend for 1 year, I just got 4 months extra, which means that the camera was registered long back.
I just checked the manufacturing date and was surprised to see that it was manufactured over 17 months ago!
Please check the camera thoroughly for any bad signs.
I applied for replacement and let's see.....what happens.",5
7211,Great one For Beginner Photography,"1. Purchase date:- 14-05-2020 with one year warranty
Warranty expiry date of camera I checked from canon wedsite:- 10-12-2021
The date and month should be same, That means warranty starts 6 months before the purchase date with two year warranty.
2. The camera package seal was broken. both camera and lense was simply put in the box without any cover.
3. Camera strap was missing.
I returned the item for replacement.

Here I am attaching the screenshots from the video I took while unpacking.",5
7212,Good for learning photography.,"Best for beginners.
-Image quality is really crisp.
-Can capture video 1080p @30FPs and 720p @60FPs. On NTSC video system.
-Build quality is also good.
-18-55mm lens is also fine for the beginning.
-Night quality is good but do not expect that much.",5
7213,Excellent camera for beginner,"Poor customer support
Product quality not upto the mark
My 13000rs Sony camera which is 5 years old is far better than this
Data transfer cable also missing

Bough it on Amazon sale
But am least happy with this product

My Samsung phone takes better pictures than this",5
7214,Perfect for beginners,Amazon delivered a second hand product.The Canon Digital camera package seal was broken and it was opened several times by previous users. The camera was with full of finger print marks. There was no provision for return of product. I am not satisfied with a second hand product with price for the original product.,5
7215,Good option for beginners,"Very beginner friendly. I bought it for my cousin who is a complete newbie in photography. And he took this picture (attached) in his first day. The focus speed is not as good as Nikon entry levels, and the battery backup is slightly worse as well. But the color profile is much better in Canon. The details are very close to Nikon D5600. Only major negative is fixed display. But again wifi mobile connection really helps.",3
7216,Canon 1500D best quality camera,"Battery was not gud enough even after charging for long hours
First time we didn't get fine photos, aft getting help from professional photographer we got the settings done and know that Battery is the oly problem but camera is gud",5
7217,Best DSLR for beginers...,"I can say it's a best camera for photography.
This is my first dslr I bought during Amazon sale @22k. I was confused between nikon d3500 & canon 1500d after getting the amazing feedback from my photographer friends I chose to go with canon brand.

This was my first shoot I did with the 18-55mm kit lense & got wonderful results. I'm looking forward to buy 1 50mm F1.4 lens to upgrade my potrait shoot.
Thanks alot Amazon your service & support can never be matched!",4
7218,Best dslr for begginer ever,I got defective lens and no buddy is helping me,5
7219,(Amazing) Never think for other cameras just buy it :),"I like very much this , image quality is vet nice First things first, it’s an incredibly functional DSLR that takes sharp images with a natural feel to them and also offers a good video quality. More importantly for beginners, however, it manages to do that right out of the box, which allows beginners to get taking great pictures and recording quality videos as soon as they unbox the DSLR.",5
7220,Good Product for 21K*,I am using past 6 months and till now I am very much satisfied from this product using day light photography but I do not know what settings are required to capture night light photo.. using default auto setting. So it's drawback or my lack of knowledge. If I get setting details from product seller then fine picture quality at night then I will revise my rating.,4
7221,external flash not working,It's my first time DSLR very nice product.i really like it .I also inquiry before purchasing it canonn 1500d . I found Nikon 3500 vs to canonn 1500d . really it's very nice . but Amazon company delivery person very bad.he didn't delivery my mention My attitude is dependent upon the way u treat me..i will take my product another person talk with him.amazone company should be look into this matter,2
7222,Canon aims likes Sniper,"Got it for 19k during festival sales
Incredible for that price
Easy to use and good picture quality

Easy to transfer photos via nfc
Good battery also",5
7223,Just AWESOME!!!,"It's an awesome product from the home of 'Canon'. Product is really very fine to handle. Thanks to the Amazon team.
If you're a beginner, then you can go for the basic training classes through YouTube or an instructor. Functionality of the product is far interesting & a beginner should learn step by step.
In the end, the product is worth for you in an unique budget. Go for it 👍",5
7224,Good one in the budget,"DO NOT BUY

Canon has tried to create monopoly through this model. Hot shoe has been changed so now only canon flash lights will work with this model i.e. Canon eos 1500d.
They have NOT even mentioned this anywhere on amazon or on their website, not even the dealers of canon know this new development.

The LCD screen could have been given a flap covering which was in previous models.",4
7225,Worst Autofocus System In This DSLR,"This Camera is the King of Budget segment Cameras.
This camera gives you excellent results only if you know how to use a dslr.
The 55-250 lens is more reliable than 18-55.
To reduce the focusing noise use stm or usm lens.
Build quality is mind blowing..
Used the camera for 1 year and is extremely Satisfied.
Best camera for beginners and for others you can use this as a secondary camera.
Battery life is decent.
For New users who are not excellent in manual mode can approach youtube and learn the basics.
Other modes are not useful.Use Av,Tv,M modes for photography.
Video quality is poor as this is not a video camera.
The Wifi Feature is handy and makes transfering of images quick.
50mm Lens suits excellent for the camera.
You can check my insta handle for images captured using this camera mr.panicker__

Negative:
Low light photography is not impressive
Produces grains at high iso 6400",1
7226,Good camera,"False advertisement
No touchscreen
Lens doesn't do a good job
Makes too much sound while focussing
No good focus at all.
Blurry videos
No flash in videos.

It's my First day with this camera
And I'm highly highly highly disappointed.
Please
I repeat please DO NOT PURCHASE IT
EVEN IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER.
Else you will cry like me",5
7227,Seal was already open and price drastically decreased in one day after purchase,"Some people believe that online shopping is not safe for digital items .but it's not true .I have been buying products from Amazon for 3 years. I didn't receive any of the item as damaged.It was a very big decision of mine to buy an item of heavy amount through online shopping, I was thinking that it would come damaged or broken but after receiving it I will say that it is best for normal people who use to click photos everywhere they travel as Nikon is good for the photographers .I will recommend the viewers of the product to surely buy this .👍",1
7228,Value for money,Amazing picture quality even with the kit lense..colors are very much natural...for beginner its a very nice camera.. light weight...i wish this could have rotating LCD viewer screen but thats not an big issue..,4
7229,awesome camera in this price range,"Best for beginners and if you are buying this for vlogging purposes i will not recommend it because it is very hard to handle without a gimbal or tripod.
Picture quality is superb and video quality is good.
Battery capacity is very good comparing to other models of canon.
Auto focus is fine and inbuilt flash is superb.
Wifi and nfc are Woking fast and no lag at all.
I recommend this for professional videographers and YouTubers the most.",5
7230,Good,A great product for beginners. Got it for 21k during amazon sale and using sbi card cash back. Worth every penny if u really want to click your moments and cherish later. Even my wife is also much comfortable using this camera since it has screen view mode. Also the automode sets the ISO and white balance allowing clicking shots without looking for a setting if u r in a hurry. Wifi connect is very convinient. U can just download whichever image u like.,4
7231,Nice,"I received the product on 4.10.2019. When I tried to register the product with the website of canon to get extended warranty, it is revealed that the product has already been registered on 13.06.2019. So, the warranty would expire on 12.6.2021. It is also revealed that the supplier's name is incorrect, when I entered the details of the supplier on the website of canon, which is the same as shown in the invoice. To net result is that the warranty is reduced by two and a half months. I have reason to believe that it is a used product. The vendor is expected to you answer my doubts",5
7232,Good for beginners,"Good camera
Started loving it and i could able to use the cam as a pro
Autofocus is so bad on kitlens i don't know is it same on other lens
Night snaps are average and if you gys can use on manual mode you will get awesome results if it's on auto night photography is little bit bad
Overall it's a perfect choice for beginners
Not recommended video shooting on auto focus",3
7233,Decent camera for a beginner.,"Good camera, but no external mic port.. if you want a camera with external voice recorder please select some other one. Without knowing this I had purchased this, even the same day return also not possible with Amazon. But camera is awesome, try to purchase with combo lense otherwise lense cost will be more.",4
7234,First Choice for Beginners,"For the beginner, this is a perfect choice. Also, I got a huge discount on this one on Prime day. Thanks to Amazon :)
The only problem I am facing is unable to register its 2 years warranty on the canon website. However, Amazon also solved this issue by providing the same 2 years warranty on this product.",5
7235,Lens is not good...,"For beginners in the photography world: The 1st thing you should do after buying a camera is understanding the concepts (shutter speed, aperture, ISO, metering etc). For this please go with some youtube videos to learn the basics.
do not ever keep in auto mode and shoot. learn the things and keep in manual modes (P, Tv, Av, M). Even the ISO, do not keep in Auto for ISO. It will introduce more noise in the image.",4
7236,Beginner's Best Choice,"This camera is very good for beginners. U can go with 1500 or 3000d . But the picture quality and video quality in 1500d is not that mark . Its auto fuces is too bad . If I r vlogger and have less bought pls get your self better mobile , this camera is not for videos. It record videos at 1080p 30 fps . 720p 50 fps . Video samples are quit good and above average. Go with prime lens 18 55mm lens for boke or blue background for u r photos and videos quit better then 3000d . I got this camera 20990 Rs ( sbi debit card 10% off offer )only in great Indian sale",5
7237,Excellent for budding photography enthusiasts,This bad camera also it is not supported with triggers and extra flash his given point is not compatible with other brands for beginners if he buy only cannon flash and trigger very costly and photo quality also bad my I phone quality is much more better then this dslr useless camera don’t waste your money I already wasted,5
7238,Picture quality supr ah iruku❤️,"A budget friendly Camera for beginners.📸
I bought this for 19k💰
It's doesn't disappointing me😊
A Great Camera for learning photography.👨‍🏫
You want to learn photography then go for it.
Great Picture Quality at this price range🖼",5
7239,Easy to use for beginners,"Initially I was looking for Nikon DSLR, but went with Canon 1500D. I must say that I have made the right choice as it works like a charm, looks good and built quality is very good. Best entry level DSLR.",5
7240,Delivered on time and easy to use,"I am a beginner. i loved the settings its easy to lean ISO and AF Settings. And i got 55 250 MM lens free with this and teh focus for that lens is awesome.. Also Stability is great. While clicking portrait pics its coming so good. Better then Iphone XR.

Just one thing it makes too much sound thats it otherwise its worth buying....",5
7241,Loving it!!,"As expected, the entry level DSLR is best for beginners. Its easy to operate. I got 18-55 lense which is good for all except zoom, only 3x. However, you have to buy a zoom lens for that purpose. Battery is also good. It lasts the whole day with continuous shooting.",5
7242,Great camera for beginners,"A perfect camera for beginners. If you are not a professional ,this camera will suffice all your needs.
Good Autofocus
Great picture quality.
And best thing is remote operability from canon camera connect App. This really helps for nature photography.",5
7243,Best product for beginners,"As a beginner in photography myself, i was suggested to buy this product by a photographer friend of mine. So far, good to practice your skills on, but definitely would suggest to move on to other better options quickly.

It comes with a kit lense and a kit bag to hold the camera body, lense and batterycharger, but the holding loop of the bag got torn off on the second day !!!... That was a bit dissapointing.",5
7244,Don't buy specially if seller is Appario Retail Private Ltd,"Main drawback is that, It does not have 3.5 mm jack for recording audio... A connector to connect its mini usb port to 3.5 mm jack should be in its accessories",1
7245,Used camera,"Very good camera but canon is simply loosing its credebility but making silly changes in the camera to restrict this camera for professional use .

This camera is not suitable for studio photography as canon has removed the the universal pin from the camera hotshoe ..

Shame on canon ...",1
7246,Worth for money,Amazing camera for beginners like me. Awesome picture quality and best part is it has auto mode which will do everything we just have to click the photos. Really liked this camera.,5
7247,Good product,Cannot attach flashgun,5
7248,Poor,Ok but not useful with basic lens provided with it...pictures are look like you are taken with mobile camera ...pic you are thinking of to taken with dslr are only comes with higher lenses you used ...either you go for 50-250 or 70-300 but basic lens 15-55 are useless.,2
7249,Am not happy with this product,Value for money. Good for beginers. I used for video recording. Max record upto 12 min. as per standards. No external mic support to record audio as it's entry level DSLR. I used previously canon 1300D which of 18 MP but it's of 24 MP which is better for photos and videos as well. More durable. Got in deal around 24000 rupee. More than happy.,2
7250,Begginers Camera,Probably the Camera is Good for Beginners and Budget Price. The main problem is we can't insert microphone in the camera. Otherwise the camera is really good for the price. I have used this camera past 7 months,5
7251,Go for it..if u r beginner....,"Perfect to capture every special moments of your life..

No need of expertise, camera adjust itself to capure best photos.. picture quality is awesome..battery works for 3-4hrs after fully charged. wifi function is very useful to download photos in your mobile. overall performance ia good..",4
7252,Value for money. ..,We purchased it for a gift. It really was a great deal. The best part is that it was liked by the person whom we gifted. He actually enjoys it now. The photos are sharp and usability is good. Great product and good quality by Amazon.,5
7253,One of the best at this price,"Very bad experience of service , 45 days for after service delivery, if got the camera after 45 days for I have travel for 150 km , the camera have hanging problem from the month of perchse",5
7254,Required Software Development kit for this not provided Cameras are useless for me without SDK.,Best camera for beginners and short film makers. Camera is very well packed and it looks awesome. The user manual is very useful for first time buying people. Zoom lens is awesome. And the carrying bag is also very good. I really liked the product and it give me a better experience. Thank you canon and also Amazon 🙏,1
7255,Great camera for amateurs..,"Nikon 3400 is better than 3500 so don't buy nikon 3500.
But i choose canon 1500 because wifi , camera app,
You definitely need extra lens. 50mm is good because i though kit lens is ok for me but believe me you definitely need extra lens. Zoom lens is not you need so don't buy with combo lens. Go for 50 mm lens. Now one more thing",5
7256,Bought during sale,This Camera is worth the money but the Focus is slow and one very bad about this camera is that it doesn't have 3.5mm external mic port connection other wise picture quality with prime lens and zoom lens is awesome.,2
7257,Awesome service from Amazon.,Not good for beginners as well as professional users. price is too high for the picture quality that this camera gives. Nikon 3500D gives great photos with blur in the background and is also best in this price range.,5
7258,Good Camera for beginners,"Budget DSLR. Photo qualities of flowers are awesome. But normal photography is average equivalent to good quality images of photo captured from most of the mobile phone except pixels.
Clearity is good which can't be available in most of the image captured from mobile ..
there is no in built image effect. So image u will get will be original.
So it can be tried. But if u have budget,I will guggest better to
go for higher version .",5
7259,Canon 1500d,"This is my first CAMERA and its perfect DSL for beginners. Picture quality is awesome. Auto focus is amazing. Still in learning phase but so far I like this product very much. Soon will purchase another lens beyond 50+
Lastly again before time delivery from Amazon.",4
7260,Value for money,"Hey there, I am just a beginner so not going to deep. Definetly as a beginner I feel very comfartable using this camera. Autofocus is enough if you are not shooting moving pictures.If you use in manual mode and keep the perfect settings you will get the best result. For the price this is the best you can expect. And as I said I am a beginner and learning photography. So if I pointed anything wrong please apologize.",5
7261,For photography also camera setting is very important in manual mode.,"Bought this camera for about 23000.The camera was packed pretty well.
The camera is really good for beginners.Some people say the kit lens is bad but I feel you can get some pretty decent shots once you learn how to use it.The auto focus is not that good so I recommend you use the manual focus,just to get your perfect shot.one of the reasons I bought this camera is because of the wifi function.It works really well and it is convenient .",5
7262,Superb camera,"No hot shoe
Have attached photos of the same
Huge Flash issue
Don’t buy canon 1500D if you want to use third party flash with this camera as it doesn’t have Center hot shoe.
Third party flash cost less.
As a entry level camera the cost of camera is low.
But You’ll be forced to buy canon flash only as only canon flash are supported and canon flash are expensive.
Go for other canon models which have Center hot shoe.",5
7263,Best camera at this price range,"Amazing camera. Got it in 27k with 18-55 and 55-250 lens in great india sale. Easy to handle all functions and picture quality is awsum.

7264,Data cable,"It is best for daylight shoots not perfect for night shoots........... It is used for the beginner because I am also a beginner....

7265,Great deal @18990 rupees,Good product For begginers and if you want to good quality picturs you should buy this product .

Not for record video autofocus vary bad
No 9 point autofocus only 1 autofocus point",5
7267,Best Dslr for beginners and long battery life.,"This is a very suitable, easy to handle DSLR camera for people who want to start out with digital photography. I was able to operate this camera very easily after learning different functionalities by watching several videos online. Strongly recommended for people with no or very little exposure to DSLR. One can always choose to buy a better lens later if they feel like upgrading the quality of the pictures.",5

7271,Very bad,Have received used item (item has already registered in canon website 2 months before I purchased.. have shared all proofs to amazon team) but customer care people suggesting me to contact manufacturer.. such a worest response have received.. Amazon team took time to respond mean time my return window period also completed..,1
7272,Replacement is not show,Camera image quality is good. However there's one major disadvantage about canon product is unlike Nikon it only support own brand accessories like external flash which is wayyyy tooooo costly. (~12k). For beginner use it can work good but only in daylight.,1
7273,Excellent product,"Amazing build quality. Best camera for beginners and also for mediocre users. I belive anyone who knows basic rules of photography should buy this, you will have an amazing time with this camera, the canon mobile app also helps with the remote capture. Autofocus could have been better for subject which are really close but never the less its the best entry level camera in the world",5
7274,Awsome,"Excellent product/build quality under budget price, excellent picture quality, best choice for upgrading lower priced lenses (canon 50mm).
flipscreen and headphone jack for recording audio is missing.",5
7275,Ideal for beginners,"Highly disappointed with the problems I'm facing with the camera, the flash of the camera stops working and start showing error 50. Restarted many times but the problem remained same.",5

7279,First DSLR... loved the product,Best for Beginners - Nice picture quality,4
7280,Great camera for beginners.,"The Canon 1500D is an excellent package for begineers. The controls are amazing and easy to use. The images are crisp and clear. The autofocus is also great.
The only con i noticed in this product is that when we are in screen display mode for capturing images the auto focus take a lot of time to focus on the subject.
Otherwise overallthe product is worth every penny.
Thanks to Amazon for ontime delivery and great package.",4
7281,Awsome,If you want to buy a dslr under 30k then this is probably the best choice for you.....even a good hand is enough to click pictures like professionals with this dslr....just make sure you buy a portrait lens when u buy the first extra lens with this camera....this combination of 50mm lens and canon 1500D is a beast🔥,4
7282,Doesn't have 3.5 mm Jack.,"Its not at all user friendly. For every click you need to set the lense .Pics get blurred. There is no one to help or support.
Helpline no is not responding. I tried to register the product but couldnt do till date.
Canon has third class products and services",2
7283,Canon 1500D Value for Money at Amazon,"I ordered Canon EOS 1500D from Amazon and guess what, there is a missing Camera bag and merory card in the box. And box was sealed properly when I got in my hand",4

Easy to use but bit difficult to understand settings
Overall it can be said that it's mind-blowing ♥️",2
7287,For beginners camera is very good,As b begineer i used CANON 1500D but it gave me satisfactory results. In day light shooting it's awesome . Some how while using falsh u have to steady ur hands for better result . Neither u will get some shakeey pictures. For better shots day light preferable. I am using its kit lens 18-55mm and those images are aslo taken from this lense..,5
7288,Picked it for just 19.5k ! Awesome camera for beginners.,"Bought it for 19000 rs with free earphone worth 999.....its a great camera for beginners and i liked the idea of nfc, wifi transfer.... Too good.... Its a great deal",4

7292,Amazing for beginners,"I was waiting for this one.. Since a long time.. When the 1200D model was popular.. Then 1300D.. But i waited too long to own this camera.. Finally i got 1500D by amazon with a great offer @28k..

U ll get 2 lenses and a carry case and all that u want.. U can simple start photography..",5
7293,Good for beginners but night performance very poor...,The camera is great for beginners who have just stated to learn but the features are slightly complex for understanding. If you have ever used a Nikon camera..I would suggest you buy Nikon because the transition can be little uneasy. But the camera in itself is very good. I have used this camera in limited scenarios but experienced so far is great.,4
7294,After using of 2months captured more then 5000 images,"Pros-Best for beginners. Best deal worth 19,950 with EF-S 18-55 lense+ focal earphones worth 1999 MRP with this deal.

Other wise I will think for return of the Product. Supply of Original Bag for this particular Bag should be there. Just replace the Bag with the return period.,5
7317,Must buy,"If you are a beginner go for it .The auto focus is just fine, speaking about picture quality the 24 mp works fine even in low light",5
7318,Good Product for Begineer,The package reached me safe with good packing. It is an original product. It came with bill and warranty card.. Nice product.. A very good camera in this price range for beginners. The picture quality is fine. If this is your first DSLR you can blindly choose this.,5

7327,They didi not provide me the carry case..,"Very good for beginners
Autofocus is not very good as it has only 9 af points
The screen is also not moveable
Compact and user friendly
Lightweight
The raw file is in CR2 format which is not easy to open and edit in simple software
Nikon D5600 is also in the same line you can buy but has less megapixel, but high af points and moveable screen",4
7328,Feedback,If you are going with this camera then fine but you can't use third party additional flash light you have to bought canon flash which is costing more than 20000 so I prefer if you want to use it with additional so don't buy it otherwise for normal purpose at-home it is fine,5
7329,Fraud Amazon,Picture quality is too good... Being an amateur i like how easy it is to use... Still a lot to learn... Battery life is good as well... Charge once to the fullest and came back from a three day trip to shillong... And it is still going on,5
7330,Good 👍 one. Go for it.,This is a very good product for beginners at this price. I got this for 22k in amazon when there was a one day deal. It is so far so good. Excellent product if would just like to use it for small family parties and gatherings.,4
7331,Nice background blur,Amazing product. I get appreciation for every picture I take and all of it should go to the camera. Beginners like me can use this with absolute ease. Photo transfer to photo or laptop is made so simple that it can happen in few minutes... Excellent product.,5
7332,Nikon is better than canon,Just don't expect very fast af from this one (which I did). The camera is a good one but the lenses make some noise while autofocusing and sometimes you'd prefer to use the manual focus. This 1500d is absolutely not for shooting videos. Picture quality is average. I bought it with the 50mm and it's okay. Anyways it's gud for beginners. Attached some pics I clicked of and a portrait of my friend.,3
7333,Good,It's easy to know about all setting... I also don't know about photography and how to use camera but still in 4 to 5 days i learn mainly every thing from this camera... It's very helpful for beginners and their autofocus or picture quality was so nice.... But some time in manual mode it create more time to click a picture.,5
7334,camera seems to be ok. However SD card is not working and needs replacement.,Attached snapshots taken from Canon 1500D,4
7335,Awesome 😎 product in Cheapest price 😳😳😳,"Being a beginner myself, the camera is an excellent option for those who are just stepping into the creative art of photography as it can give them all the tools needed to harness their skills.",5
7336,Got it at price 29k☺️,This camera named canon 1500D I bought from amazon is completely a basic level camera. It has overall every features a beginner needs and 2ndly it has guide with it which is very much helpful for beginners in every steps .,5
7337,"Nice camera ,but camera bag is not good",Awsome product i get it for 22000 in great Indian festival sale with one year extra waranty.the photos are awesome for a beginner its the best in the market go for it,5

7342,Loved,This camera is great for beginners. The default lens is good for initial practice but this camera will work best with lens having focalength greater than 50 mm. Overall nice product to begin with in the field of photography.,5
7343,Nice camera but video shooting is not up to mark,"Perfect beginner level dslr, met its pixel quality. I have used it for an year now and its the best if you are new to dslr's. Good battery, best lens and top camera. The body's is a bit heavy,but best at this price.",4
7344,Beginner's photography,"Auto focus of camera is pathetic, image quality is quite good but object finder doesn't work well,better to buy canon 200d, no external audio recording option.",5
7345,Nice DSLR Camera for Beginners,"Really good DSLR for beginners
Only downside is the Canon app which doesn't help in transferring videos wirelessly",4
7346,Best for beginners,First dslr.. Extremely happy with the purchase...! Cheap and best...! Got it at 19k in an offer..!,4
7347,Canon 1500d value of money ✌🏻,"The camera is perfect for an amateur photographer. The auto focusing is smooth and of quality. The body is lite as well which helps in taking quality pictures. The controls are a bit confusing, especially the menu. However, an enthusiastic person will be able to figure the controls out pretty easily. All in all, it's a fabulous product",5
7348,"Worth of Money, Great product","Good camera for beginners, picture and video quality is good , I am using it for making youtube videos. Very good product at this low cost.",5
7349,Best SLR for beginners,"Everything is Good But You should buy without any lens and get the new model STM Lens which has Digital Focus..Avoid IS ii Lens which comes with these model..

Autofocus missed in Videomode..so it's not suitable for Gimbels",5
7350,It's over all ok not so bad not so good,Good for learning photography. Go through the online video tutorials for photography.

7356,Dslr lover,"this is my first dslr and im very happy for having it.
it comes with enough features which every beginner needs.

7357,great,It looks like higher end dslr feels good in hands and i love canon. Picture quality is very good more then my expectation. In low light also it performs well i like canon 1500d 😍.,5
7358,Lack accessories support,"Amazing Photos for beginners photography.

8130,Best product under 10k,"The problem is in the picture clarity. The left half is absolutely excellent but not on the other side, some yellowish color which dulls the monitor. Have called LG Customer care for service and awaiting his presence to sort out this issue. If not I will soon return the product.

Update: The service person convincing that it is nature quality of the light reflected which appears in white background. Yes, couldn't able to find any yellowish while playing videos. But, still it looks awkward. I usually work with white background software where I do not prefer this rile thing. I'm returning this LG monitor. Thanks to LG and Amazon for this awful experience.

Replaced Product Update: Now Amazon making me not to buy their products.
1. Seal is broken and revamped.
2. There is a bulge/ bump in the frame of the screen.
Returning this frustrating product. And I want my money back.
I think this is my last purchase from Amazon.
@Amazon, Don't play with LG brand, LG has lost one loyal customer because of you.",5
8131,"Brightness not equal in entire the display, IPS Technology not Working grate on this product","This is a good 1080p monitor at this price:
i have purchased it @8199 during sale, and i feel it just worth it considering the price the product is well build comes with max 2 years of Warranty do read all the warranty related information on LG website or on the warranty card>
the Monitor comes with a HDMI port, by default i remain on 60Hz but if u want u cant take it upto 75Hz (u need a AMD card running on HDMI with AMD free sync On)
colors are pre-calibrated but the coverage is only 75% of the color gamut
contrast ratio is also good
Dont Get Confused about this Monitor This is a IPS LED montior Not LCD as its written on product name(for a moment i got confused with that)
It is not entirely bezel less there is a small bezel but its doesn't looks bad!

if you are planning to buy this monitor go with!
Hope these informations would be helpful to you all.. !",1
8132,Very Satisfied!,"Excellent monitor at this price range .display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. You get an HDMI cable too, even though I didn't see it being mentioned in the product page. I am fully satisfied after buying such affordable and budget range Full HD LED Monitor.

Cons:
1. Glossy plastic back and stand finish attract lot of fingerprints
2. Stand can only tilt, there is no height adjustment or rotation feature
3. Only one HDMI Port
4: No Speakers and USB port",4
8133,Great value for money!,"This is a splendid product. Very to-the-point approach from the manufacturing perspective. One of the best price-to-performance ratio.

Pros:
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate automatically shoots beyond the 60Hz limit.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. Prolonged exposure to vibrant and bright colors are not always the best fit for programming. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Beautiful and faithful color representations.

Cons:
1. No horizontal swivel. This is a minor nice-to-have feature. However, the monitor does have adjustable vertical swiveling, which makes up for the missing feature.
2. The main monitor control button (at the bottom base) is a little cumbersome to handle. This could have been better designed.

Two things to take note of:
A. If Freesync is turned on, you might have difficulties getting into BIOS as many motherboards do not support displays beyond 60Hz. It's kinda stupid but worth knowing
B. For the programmers: This is a normal DPI monitor (meaning the Dots-Per-Inch is 96 and so, it does not fall into the high-DPI category). This is just an information. This does not mean that the monitor is good or bad. Just that it is a normal DPI monitor.

All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.",5
8134,Good product but needs more improvement with this price.,"The whole box comes with plastic visible wrapper. So the shipping was awesome in 1 days delivery. However inside the box 1 monitor, 1 stand neck , 1 base stand, 1 cable management clip, 1 HDMI cable, 1 driver cd, and some documents comes. No vga cable . Hence can use your old one. The base stand's design is awesome with half circle shape. Made inside with aluminium finished with hard glossy black plastic. The stand neck and the back side of the monitor also has glossy plastic finish. Back side there 5 ports including vga port named as D-SUB and HDMI port. So I connected my monitor via vga cable cause I have no HDMI port. however ther are wall hanging option too at back. Front side the whole 16:9 ration screen has very narrow literally invisible bezel but when you will switch on the display you can notice very thin bezel at 3 side while the bottom has normal brezel with LG logo and only one joystick switch (Lg likes joystick ) . The resolution of the monitor is pure Full Hd with IPS cinema panel . The panel quality is A++ with very accurate real color production and this is the feature of the IPS panel. IPS panel is very helpful to the editors or graphics designers or gamers. Also this monitor has black stabilizer by which you can easily enjoy the dark scenes on screen. LG is a leading led tv maker company with OLED screen, so it is as expected that it have to be a great panel. The control of the monitor's can be changed either from the utility on screen display software provided in the cd or by the joystick monitor button moving and clicking right left up and down. However the other company's monitor is not so good or balanced cause either they have panel with corner light bleed or faded color grade or less port while this monitor has balanced features with perfect black which makes this monitor great and popular. I damn gurantee that you will not regreat after buying. Also this monitor is protected by Lg's manufacturing warranty. I got this monitor at Rs 6800 with card instant discount. So thanks amazon and thanks seller and thanks LG . Hit Like if you have liked this preview",3
8135,Best Gaming Monitor under 10k,"Product is good. But after 2months of purchase my monitor is showing vertical green line at right side. And I have to go to service center too soon. And they told they replace panel, whether I don't know they replaced panel or not. Then they called me after 3 days to take my monitor. And the problem was solved. And again after 3 months I faced same problem and took to service center they are simply saying water damage. And this won't come under warranty. And they showing only photo of monitor panel which is good. And they are telling they'll charge for that. And I never wiped my monitor with dry or wet cloth then how could this happen. And I even know that's not water damage. They simply want to charge money from me. And I'm never gonna buy any lg products anymore.one of the worst customer center is lg. Its better to go with dell monitors",5

8137,Best Quality - 100% Trusted,"First of all thanks to Amazon for delivering this product within 24 hours from chakan.
1)Display of this led monitor is quite fabulous 👌I'm fully satisfied with it.
2) It gives upto 75hz refresh rate but by default it gives 60hz you need to change it by going to display settings.
3)Gaming performance quite looks like a charm that's what I can say right now after 9 days of usage. I will highly recommend to buy this product from amazon and I'm sure it will win your heart too ♥️
**Updated 11/04/2021**
This is the second monitor I bought for dual monitor setup and its simple awesome... Thanks Amazon once again",5
8138,"Display is really really good, but ...","So Sad to recieve a defective product when u r as excited as i was 😭 . The right side of my monitor had a large shadow, dull area . I’ve returned it,will order again from diff seller after gettin my money back 🙏🏻",4
8139,Crispy display with a sleek look!,"the color quality is not up to the mark especially blak color is very poor in screen -screen shows grey color which is bit disappointing after spending double money on IPS technology.
Pros-1.average power consumption is about 14 W which is good
2.stand and look is good
3. reading profile settings is available with pc software which is easily manageable.

cons- 1.in built picture control is very bright and flickering you need to set colors and display settings from PC
2.IPS panel quality is not up to the mark the contrast ratio is poor and black color is dull in screen, which is most important factor of Panel in order to enjoy perfect viewing experience.
3 default brightness level of monitor is very high recommended to adjust it with in built graphic software of PC.",4
8140,Value for money,The very first thing I loved about this monitor is that its color calibrated. Not many monitors are. The first monitor I received took a beating during shipping and had a horrible backlight bleed. The second one was good and has no backlight bleed issues. The display quality is fantastic. The color is uniform and there is no flicker. There is a bit of IPS glow just like any other IPS panel. Navigation using the joystick is a breeze. I paired it up with my PS4 and everything has been smooth sailing. Just remember that if you notice backlight bleed after buying this monitor get a replacement asap. No one is mentioning about backlight bleed here and just accepting it as if it's a common defect.,5
8141,Best FHD monitor in the price range.,"So the monitor stop working after 2 days of use , it was good until 2days but after that it become a trash

So I got a replacement for the monitor later
Guess what
It's was not working either

And now I got a another replacement
It was working but the quality was so much disappointing after 3 days the colour of screen become more pink , so I adjusted it by reducing the red colour in rgb but still it was not a good experience

The Amazon services suck
I really wanted a refund I don't got it

Tip: for buying monitor
Don't get lured to free sync monitor if it's only 60hz monitor

For gaming look for High hz rate monitor instead of type of panel
Usually go for the tn panel it's cheaper and have high frame rate and more fps
For gaming fps is more important than viewing angle, color and contrast
60hz monitor are not suitable for high end games go for a 120 or 144hz but don't buy that if you don't have a proper graphic card

Buy a ips panel only if you are going to watch too many videos but not for gaming unless you have a really enormous budget

Va panel is a compromising option between ips and TN panel",5
8142,Worst product and worst service,"<<dishonest Seller/LG>> THEY ARE SENDING RENEWED PRODUCT AT NEW BUYING.
I'm saying this because the display panel (i.e. LCD panel) changed to lower quality panel. At the display resolution 1920 X 1080 @ 75 Hz the blue color (color code #0078d7) looks pixelated and if the refresh rate is reduce to 60 Hz this problem almost gone. This thing happen when the panel mismatched with the controlled board.
I asked to monitor technicians and other who also repair monitors, they have same opinion.

I saw this monitor at our local computer shop and my friends also buy this same model from local shop. But the monitors from local shop has a grate picture quality and less back-light bleeding (barely noticeable ). And no pixelated blue color.

There is no option for No Star rating, so I've to given one Star.

I DON'T RECOMMENDED THIS MONITOR FOR GAMING. Because the response time is about 10ms on normal settings.
About 5ms is possible by turning on the faster mode but there is too much inverse ghosting. And that will be a bad experience of gaming.
Also beware of LG service at Westbengal region. According to their warranty policy the product can't be replaced only repaired. And the service person can't do anything except changing the service date.

(In my case I called for the upper bar glowing problem but the service person, instead of coming to my house he solved the problem by himself. Yes , the person send a problem solved massage to LG against my complained without coming to my house, without seeing the problem with monitor. That was his supper power)",1
8143,Good monitor for office and home use,"I expected it to be good.. But when it came, I opened it and plugged it in.. then I was just delighted with happiness..

Believe me it's the best panel under 10k budget.. Many of friends have different types of monitors .. but when it comes to picture quality.. This one is at the top of the list ..

The color reproductions are outstanding..
75hz , free sync , alsmost borderless display and most importantly IPS panel and yes the best IPS panel in the segment..

No bleeding issue..
I didn't notice IPS glow..

Blacks are pure blacks..

But only minimal problem is that it can not be tilted backward..

Don't be panic going through negative reviews.. I will give it 10/10 on the price",5
8144,So far it's great Comes with HDMI cable no need to buy one,"Video watching is very impressive and it wont disappoint movie lovers. It can be also useful to beginner level editors. Setting up the black stabilizer well can help the editors. It has very good view angle at the same time. It provides flawless gaming experience as a monitor made for gamers.
Screen split feature is included in the on screen control. You can split the screen and assign different tasks on those. You can choose between many layouts, it can be life saver for web developers and few other professionals. While multitasking you can open PIP and play your favorite media in any part of the screen. Overall the on screen software is very simple to use while very useful. t performed exceptionally well compared to its budget. i will recommend LG22MP68VQ-P monitor for gamers, photo and video editors, web developers and professionals specially for those who are looking for a good monitor and tight on budget.",5
8145,Economic gaming monitor,"Very good for the price range I got this one for 6400RS in great Indian festival sale. Very good for development purpose. Matt finish is good, not recommended for photo editing",5
8146,Pleased with the quality. Beats all competitors in same price range IMO,"Monitor is good but it's software doesn't work in windows environment when connected with VGA cable, need to check with HDMI cable
Software works perfectly in Macbook when connected with HDMI cable
Appears like technically VGA cable doesn't support/provide two way communication

Sometimes when I remove macbook from HDMI and connect windows laptop with VGA cable then it does not recognize input signal and need to manually select input device.",4
8147,A nice IPS panel for PC and Consoles but with an issue of screen(light) bleeding,"It's great for gaming as well as watching media.. It's a great entertainment device..All u need is speakers when watching movies and u are all set..great response time, colour production and picture quality.. The bezeless design makes it stand out from it's competitors..",5
8148,Best IPS monitor at this price range,"The monitor is very nice overall with a matte finish and 3 side narrow bezel. Excellent product if you want to mount 2 next to each other.

I upgraded from an old LG monitor which was VESA mounted to the wall and was hoping put this in instead, first it did not come with the screws and the ones from the old monitor would not work (too long) and second you need to leave about 3 inches between the back of the monitor and the wall (so only a swivel type VESA stand will work).

Second problem is the handling of low resolution video (480p) and below. My earlier 19 inch monitor would handle 480p video quite well and the same looks extremely grainy on this 22 inch monitor. Don't know what is causing this but since I only changed the monitors and nothing else, I assume it is the monitor.",4
8149,"Best Budget Monitor, Go for it.","Bought it for 7,999/- including cashback and all

Bringhtness control & contrast control is just perfect.
Colors look quiet well.

Blacks are very clear in movies and games.
No need to change settings for CSGO.

Reader mode is also good but i just change contrast and brightness to suit me.
Viewing angles are good
That cable holder is very useful.
And color calibration is seems good to me.

Edit: cable holder is not that sturdy,
Have some driver issues, screen tearing while playing videos and games at 60fps of higher",5
8150,Great value for money @6752 in sale,"One of the best monitor you can get under 10k
I got it under Rs 8999 so it was a great deal
Pros :
Matt finish no reflection
Very slim bezels
Easy assembly
You can adjust it vertical
Cons :
It requires drivers to be installed no plug and play.
There was no amazon cardboard box the bill was pastes on the box of lg in which the monitor came and the serial number is not readable.

But you can easily find them on lg product website under support section
I'm currently using it with my laptop and it is a big upgrade from it's small 15.6 inch screen and 720p resolution",5
8151,LG Monitor FHD,"I bought this monitor for my PS4 console. The picture quality produced by the monitor is amazing as it has IPS panel. The display is also anti-glare with mate finish.
It has only 1 HDMI port,1 VGA port and 1 DVI port.And also 1 aux port for audio.",4
8152,Works like charm on my LinuxMint Ubuntu OS,"Monitor stand poorly designed with forward tilt, little jerk and monitor fell flat on the front panel, screen damaged is damaged and gone forever..thin bezel is not good for strength of the panel..I only buy Dell monitors which are robust, went for this seeing the review.
Even display quality is not that great, too bright. May be good for games but not for regular viewing.",5
8153,Love the monitor,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I just got this monitor 3 to 4 days ago... And today i just set up my new system, and npw all of a sudden a red horizontal start to blink on the bottom area of the screen.. Near the windows search bar which is very annoying.. Totally going for a replacement.. Didn't expect fomrom LG. Dissapointed..",5
8154,Awesome,"I gave 2 star Just because of Vertical Red line on the screen, otherwise, its worth to buy under 10K.

I received my order on 2.9.2019, unfortunately there's some problem in the screen.

I think it need to install Monitor driver. after installing monitor driver still having the same problem.. i change the cables, still its not working.. So, i ask for replacement.",5
8155,Excellent monitor at an affordable price!,"Been using this monitor for over 6 months and I think it was the best in it’s category.

For Gaming: Great @ 60 Hz, Bad because I was getting another monitor by LG which was supporting 75 Hz. But again the Gaming Monitor by LG had so many issues like dead pixels, glare and etc.

In short this monitor is okay if you own a GTX 1050 Ti or lower since most of the games run @ 60FPS with that card. Get a 144 Hz monitor with a GTX 1060 or higher.

For working: Perfect, no issues at all. No flickering, no dead pixels, work non stop without any annoyance.

I’d give it a 8.5/10

I just removed a few points because the swivel is not actually a swivel, integrated speakers would’ve been amazing.

Please click helpful if you liked my review :)",5
8156,Great product for price,"This monitor is one of the most recommended for those who want a good quality gaming/multimedia monitor at a budget price. It has Freesync so when paired with an AMD GPU you get stutter free gaming. IPS panels are gorgeous and visuals look stunning. Bezels are very thin and the anti glare coating is a nice addition

Cons:
1. No Display Port (So no Freesync via Nvidia cards)
2. No height adjustable but supports VEGA mounts",4
8157,Very good product,"Hi,

They say multi-screen display but this is not active with this product. My need was that but after observing its not supported its dis-appointing and but adv says it on amazon page....
Like this many other features are missing. Please be careful on your needs on this costly monitor of 8,899.00Rs.

Also, as per description they say ""1 Headphone Port"" which is not true. Please correct it amazon.

no usb port very big disappointment at this price.

Thanks",4
8158,Perfect buy,"Received a old manufactured product,the monitor was manufactured and imported in the year 2013..
initiated return let see what happens next..",5
8159,Good for coding - LG software - good colours - gaming - vesa mount,"Great monitor for the PC. Full HD, multiple inputs.
It has a 3.5 mm jack audio output which will work only in case HDMI input is connected.
Was able to connect to a set up box via HDMI cable and it converted as a TV and used headphones for audio.
After a long research was confused between Dell S2240L which is best in 21.5 inch segment and LG22MP58 , chose lg because of 3.5 mm jack and its 2k cheaper.",5
8160,Customize it as Tv or with CPU as per the Needs.,"INTRODUCTION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are looking for a great monitor, your search has ended. Without a doubt, it is the best budget gaming monitor . It is also the best monitor for video editing, movie watching and Internet browsing under 10,000 Rupees. And I will also try to explain, why it is better than its competitors, the Dell S2216H and HP 22ES, which are also awesome monitors under 10,000.

WHY THIS MONITOR IS INTERESTING :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Under the budget of 10,000,

a) It is among the very few monitors which are :

* 1) 21.5 inch (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, Benq RL2240HE, Samsung LS22E310HY/XL, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 2) Full HD(Dell S2216H, HP 22ES, Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM,LG 22MP58VQ, LG 22M38D, BenQ GW2270HM, HP 22KD),
* 3) IPS (Dell S2216H, HP 22ES,LG 22MP58VQ),
* 4) Matte screen with IPS panel (LG 22MP58VQ and Samsung LS19F350HNWXXL(Glossy with PLS panel) ) (others have either glossy screen with IPS panel or matte screen with VA or TN panel)

b) And is the only one which has :

* 1) Free-sync technology,
* 2) 75 Hz refresh rate(All other have 60 HZ)

Please write in comments, if I am missing any monitor in the above list, so that others can read it.

ABOUT BRAND :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::
LG makes some awesome products and they keeps providing cutting edge technology in its monitors. No wonder, we see them so much on youtube and other websites.

BASIC INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I will try to explain what these terms mean in brackets after the specifications.

* Size 55.88cm (22)
* Panel Type IPS (Best panel type for color reproduction)
* Color Gamut (CIE1976) 72% (Color gamut refers to the various levels of colors that can potentially be displayed by a device.)
* sRGB Coverage 86.1% (This is most common color gamut. Other are Adobe RGB and Photoshop RGB)
* Color Depth (Num of Colors) 16.7M colors (Most common color depth. 10 and 12 bit color depth is for serious graphic designers)
* Pixel Pitch (mm) 0.2915*0.2915 (Distance between centre of pixels to other centre of pixel. Lower the distance, sharper the image )
* Resolution 1920 x 1080
* Brightness(Typ.) 250cd/m2 (It's ok. Many other monitors offer the same brightness)
* Contrast Ratio(Original) 1000:1 (Here VA panels are better, which offer better contrast ratios of 3000:1 like Benq GW2255, Benq GW2255HM. Better contrast ratio means deeper blacks. But for IPS 1000:1 contrast ratio is common.)
* (DFC) Mega (LG's DFC is a meaningless number. Dynamic contrast means nothing, it's marketing jargon.)
* (GTG) 5ms (Its not great, but its good for gaming. For awesome 1 ms response time look at TN panels like Benq RL2240HE)
* Viewing Angle(CR≥10) 178/178 (One of the strong points of IPS panels is great viewing angles. No color distortion even if you look from very side)
* Surface Treatment Anti-Glare,3H (Matte screen is a must have, if you have lot of light in your room)
* Display interfaces D-Sub(VGA), DVI-D, HDMI (Many others have only two of these three display interfaces)
* Audio output Headphone Out (Audio quality was not good, and why would anyone connect headphones to monitors instead of their PCs)
* Maximum Power Consumption 17.6W
* Sleep Mode Power consumption Under 0.3W

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

* Also comes with cable holder, which is a detachable plastic part, that comes separately with the monitor and attaches itself to back of stand, and manages cables, so that you cannot see cables from front. It keeps things neat and managed.
* It is VESA mount compatible. Many budget monitors are not VESA mount compatible.
* Comes pre caliberated. Not many do. You get a printed 'color calibration factory report' with monitor inside box. You don't need to adjust anything by going into menu, if you don't want.
* Not all IPS are good but this really is and shows a lot better image than TN panels.
* You see sharper image on 22 inch 1080p screen, than 24 or 27 inch 1080p screen. As all three screens have same number of pixels, smaller size will have more pixel per inch than bigger screens.

BONUS INFORMATION :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::
I am really enjoying this monitor. If you like to have lots of features at low price and still want good quality product, this monitor is for you. Honestly I am waiting to see which monitor will come to dethrone this one, as the best budget monitor. I mean which monitor will be able to add more features than this one without increasing the price and still maintaining the quality.

I have many stories to tell, about my experience with this monitor. How I connected this with different PCs and laptops and how it interacted differently on them. Not going to bore you guys with details but a word of advice try to use this monitor over HDMI, as it works better and adds feature instead of VGA.

You also get OnScreen Control Software with this monitor, which I liked. Its simple to use. You don't have to control monitor settings from menu by using the joystick but you can do it from this monitor using your mouse easily. It lets you add display presets to different applications. And the presets will change automatically, when you switch to different applications. For example; if I add Reader preset to Microsoft Word and Cinema preset to VLC player, the brightness and contrast will go down whenever I switch to Word and will go up, whenever I switch to VLC.
You can also use screen split feature with one click from it. Screen splitting is that you can split your screen and look at two, three or four windows at a time on your screen. For example; I can look at chrome and word, side by side and I will not have to switch between them again and again, if I am doing work which needs both of these applications. Although, Windows 10 and some other free softwares like WinSplit and GridVista,offer split screen feature, but I liked this software. It's easy.

Also the main thing. It really shows sharp image quality. Color and contrast are fantastic.

THE STAND OUT FEATURES OF THIS MONITOR:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As mentioned above, it is the only Free-sync monitor available under Rs 10,000.
In short, Free-sync technology allows the monitor's refresh rate to continuously adapt with respect to graphic card's frame rate. So, in a instance if your graphic card was generating 48 frames per second, your monitor will adapt to show 48 frames per second. All other monitors are fixed at 60 Hz or you can say that they are fixed to show 60 frames per second.

Now the question is why your monitor needs to adapt according to graphic card. Because it solves two problems which are,

1) tearing, when frames per second generated by your graphic card are more than 60Hz(or what monitor can output)

2) stuttering, which is generated to solve the problem of tearing by using Vertial sync technology (V-sync)

Watch some youtube videos to understand better about Free-sync. Without watching these videos, you will not understand tearing and stuttering. And without understand them, you will not understand the need of Free-sync.

Some basic things about Free-sync :

1) You will need a AMD graphic card for taking benefits of Free-sync. Because Free-sync is a AMD technology. NVidea has similar technology with name G-sync. But G-sync monitors are very costly in comparison to Free-sync monitors. And I am assured that they will not be available under Rs 10,000 for a long long time.

2) You unlock 75Hz refresh rate when you unable Free-sync.

THE PEOPLE IT WILL BENEFIT MOST :
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Gamers (even with Nvidea graphic card, as they also get 75Hz), Video editors and designers (as colors are important for them, which they cannot get on TN and VA panels) and any casual user(who simply uses computer for using mails and watch youtube videos) will benefit from this monitor.
Laptop owners who want a bigger 22 inch and higher 1080 resolution matte screen in comparison to their mostly smaller 14 inch and lower 768 resolution glossy screen.

BEST PLACE TO BUY FROM:
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Buy it from amazon, because many old units come with VGA cable. And here you get new manufactured units with HDMI cable. I received such a new unit that it was manufactured on 25th April in China and I was using it on 4 th June. Approximately 1 month after it was made. Quality of HDMI cable is good.

PROS :
::::::::::

* 1) Free-sync
* 2) Anti glare IPS screen
* 3) 75 Hz refresh rate
* 4) Crisp image quality
* 4) Black stabilizers, for adjusting screen's gamma curve, which helps in seeing dark areas of games easily.
* 5) Awesome Onscreen Control Software
* 6) Best budget gaming monitor

CONS :
:::::::::::

* 1) Bezels are not as thin as many say.
* 2) Stand can only tilt, has no height adjustment or rotation. And also wobbles.
* 3) Only one HDMI.
* 4) Shows some IPS glow.
* 5) Glossy plastic back and stand.
* 6) Because of its popularity, it might not be available or sellers might increase their prices in future.
* 7) No speakers

ALTERNATIVES :
::::::::::::::::::::::::
If you are not interested in many of the features present in this monitor you can also opt for Dell S2216H, LG 22MP58VQ and HP 22ES. Which sometimes go down in price. But HP22ES has slow response time of 14ms (GTG).

CONCLUSION :
::::::::::::::::::::::
I didn't expected something like this will ever come under the price of 10,000. But it did. It's undoubtedly the best budget gaming monitor around the world.",5
8161,Good monitor with great clarity (resolution),"This an excellent monitor, recommended buy.
I am using it with my laptop and not tried for gaming.
So far it gives very good picture quality, brightness, contrast and all.
Anti glare is great, works well on most of the conditions
Cute look with 3 side thin bezels.
Good for watching movies.
Haven't tried gaming, so I cant say about it.
Thanks to the great and efficient delivery from Amazon",5
8162,CLOUDING ISSUE and Pixel can be seen by eyes which is disgusting,"It is magical. It is a very bright and extra smooth display. I am using it without Freesync enabled, and the 1080p is absolutely the best. It took me a while transitioning from a 4:3 monitor to a 16:9 aspect ratio, but this is the perfect workable resolution. 4k monitors are stupid for a small screen. You will need at the very VERY least 32 inches to make sense of 4k resolution, otherwise the icons, the display is cringe.

Everyone knows about the LED quality of LG, it is mesmerizing. The IPS panel is absolutely bright and it is perfect for watching movies, browsing social media, checking email and the common day-to-day tasks. The blacks aren't as inky, but it is as good as an IPS panel can get at this price point, but the WHITES are absolutely LIT AF. You can't expect great gaming performance with mediocre frame rate, as it is not made for the AAA titles; but if you're a fan of the classics like I am, you would absolutely love gaming with this monitor.

It doesn't cover much of the Colour Gamut, but it will be fine for an entry-level or first time creative professionals. If you're someone who work with the visuals ie if you are a Graphic Designer, Video Editor or an entry-level intern on a very VERY tight budget, you can't get wrong with this.

If you're a casual PC user or a school/college student, you don't need to look anywhere else Simply CLICK THE BUY BUTTON. Anything else will be just overkill.",3
8163,Screen has a yellow tinge in some parts,"At this price, I dont expect anything more and overall the quality isn't bad. The contract and white balance could be better, but I have connected my MacBook and its stupid to compare a screen on a 1 lakh rs device to a 10k monitor. But, its quite light, which may seem cool, but honestly its not like we need to move it around much. The problem with it being so lightweight is that if you use this on a glass table then the vibrations are going to make the monitor wobble. I have to stabilize it by putting a phone box under the screen so it reduces the wobbling, but it still happens.",2
8164,Best in class,"Great budget monitor with above average color reproduction and a 75Hz refresh rate. For those wondering, the 15 Hz does make a visible difference. Moreover if you intend to also use the monitor for video and photo editing the ips panel thats been factory calibrated works really well unlike other “gaming” monitors that sacrifice picture quality for higher refresh rates and slower response times",4
8165,Honest Review!! @6200,"Monitor is very good and sharp picture quality. IPS Panel. Crisp image. Multiple onscreen features available (if you install OnScreen Control software). Multiple modes are available (reading mode, cinema mode, image mode, custom mode etc.). Picture in picture option is excellent. Free sync available if you use with AMD gpu. I faced a problem to find out the power on/off button. It took around 15 minutes to find it out. Then reading the user manual (available in the CD) I finally found out the power on/off button. Very easy to install, just like plug and play. This is not a bezel less monitor. I am satisfied with this product and service also. If you are looking for a pc monitor and your budget is Rs.10,000/-, then this would be a good choice. So I will give it 5-stars.",5
8166,Don't compare it with anyother IPS moniter❤️,"Awesome Product! Got it for 6400 INR. Best Deal ever and this is The best Budget Gaming Monitor You Will Ever Get.
Paired it with RX570 8GB DDR5 With FREESYNC, If you never experience this Adaptive Sync before, Try it, Pair it with AMD card and boom, Best Gaming Experience Ever. And yes its anti glare, Modern looking, Fast in response, And Mainly Color Production is Awesome. Go For it & look For Offers.",5
8167,No height adjustment,"There are many reviews already written about this monitor. I won't repeat the same things.

I would like to highlight the below points.

1.It supports AMD FreeSync but it also works with NVIDIA Gsync. Just make sure you have the latest graphic driver installed from NVIDIA. Then in NVIDIA Global settings you need to select the VSYNC option as fast.

2. Combined with AMD Ryzen 5 3600, GTX 1660 6GB DDR6 Graphics and Corsiar 3000mhz 16GB DDR4 RAM with GSync I get more than 80 FPS on Ultra settings at 1080p in Games like The WItcher 3, Hitman 2, Batman Arkham Knight.......planning to test it with more latest games like Red Dead Redemption 2.

Cons: I found only one. You will need to calibrate the screen color. It had a little greenish tone with default settings (Your experience might be different depending on your configuration).
But not a big thing, understanding the monitor controls and adjusting the screen setting took me around 5 minutes.

Overall Great Performance Monitor for gaming. If you are on tight budget go with it !!

BTW I bought it for 8499, the price is now increase to 10k. Don't know why.",3
8168,Not appropriate for office work...Good for Entertainment.,"This is the best monitor under 9k..just close your eyes and buy
Dont go for for 24 inch..many users notice led bleeding issue .
Freesync enabled..so you dont have to worry about tearing issue for gaming..for nvidia users they will get native 75hz
Matte finished which i personally prefer
Display quality is awesome 😍😍",3
8169,Good product but the item I received had an issue,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 I am not giving a review about pictures quality, features..... I will tell you about build quality.......... I used this monitor as my car window it really act as a bullet proof window ..... through this I can watch movies while driving. I have connected this monitor with my alto car super-charger, and a mobile-dish antenna.

It also has Durga IPS Pannel with anti-flicker.

And also supports AMD Free Sync which is not free it cost you about 8800rs

One day I have tested its build quality it was really an awesome experience. I throw it from my 3rd floor and after that...... It was working fine without a single scratch.
But it starts making sounds like vrrroommm vrrroommm.

You can also use this monitor as Dosa Cooking Vessel because it is really large in size. Before using it as a Dosa Vessel make sure that your heater or gas or something else have to reach atlest 69k degree celsius that's it. Now you can cook your Dosa

Best monitor is this budget.
Must buy",5
8170,Amazing dispaly,"It is an excellent price to performance ratio monitor. I would even go around saying this the best monitor under 10k even though it's 2 year old model.
Pros:

Cons

8171,Nice product for WFH setup,"I'm a big fan of LG products due to their quality. However found this monitor quite average in terms of display quality especially while watching 360p/480p videos on youtube. My old LG LCD monitor was delivering even better display for all types of videos. Not sure if this is how all IPS monitor renders the output or I need to change any settings. This review is based on 1 week of use. Will explore more & update .

One can even consider buying 24 inch version of LG IPS which comes Rs. 8700 in local store. Only con is , it will not be bazel less, stand & overall look is ordinary but if you want to watch movies from little far distance like from bed/coach , I would suggest to go for 24 inch ignoring looks.",5
8172,Great product. Must buy,"My rating is only to ascertain the fact that its a monitor that works . But, major dissapointed when I am spending above 8k on a product recommended on Amazon is that the monitor,its stand & the charger arrived in the package . NO VGA/HDMI cable . Amazon should out right ban these dealers who thrive on Consumer's money. Since I had to make it work, I bought the VGA& HDMI cable separately . I have complained about the Dealer and Amazon has not taken any action. Lastly , the monitor just powers on and off, you cannot change the Picture Mode,Input or go to Menu as displays on the monitor screen when you press the power button. But its India , who listens to Consumers ?
Sub standard product. If you are a buyer lookimg for a good monitor, no matter what rating this product has, go for a cheaper option as you may need to purchase the cables separately .",5
8173,Best picture quality And good for Gaming💻,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Price Paid: Rs. 7000
Seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc

Pros
- FULL HD IPS LED Monitor with anti-glare finish.
- Good picture quality with accurate colors. Has very high brightness, range from 0 to 100. Presently I have set both brightness and contrast at level 0, and its still bright.
- The 22-inch size doesn't feel very big, feels slightly bigger than 18.5 inch monitor.
- Very sleek and stylish looking with minimal bezels.
- Wall mounting option is provided.
- The monitor weighs just 4 Kgs.
- The monitor is powered by 19V adapter, not direct AC supply, which is better.
- It has many ports, 1 HDMI port, 1 DVI port, and 1 VGA port. For audio out, it has headphone jack. You can also connect a 2nd HDMI cable to the DVI port using an HDMI to DVI adapter.
- The monitor has only 1 switch (joystick), which is under the LG logo.
- Power consumption around 15 Watts.

Cons:
- Increases the CPU running temperature considerably unless you have the latest PC. I had a 720p monitor earlier and CPU temperature was much lower.
- Glossy finish, though not a bad thing, it can easily get scratches and fingerprints.
- Stand is not very stable, can topple forward easily.

Make sure you buy from an amazon approved seller: https://amzn.to/2Is7kBc",5
8174,Nvidia GeForce GTX,"IPS works great according to the price! Value for money IPS upgrade for graphic designers and photographers if you are using TN panel. You can't work on the TN panels after using IPS :)
The biggest advantage is the levels of whites and darks. For example you can distinguish between 100% white and 99% white on IPS, which is impossible on TN. IPS is a must have for UI Designers.",2
8175,Cheap Chinese product under LG brandname,Definitely on of the best budget monitor out there with 75hz refresh rate and full hd display. It has awesome ips panel that reproduce colors just about natural. viewing angles are very good. But when you view from angle color tends to fade a little. Though every display panel has this problem but its noticeable. Black is not fully black. You will find the led tint quite annoying in videos or gaming when scene is dark. But considering the price point its okay. I had to tinker around with the settings a bit to get the right color and brightness of my liking. The factory setup is very bright and vibrant that is not really suited for close viewing. Your eyes will feel the stress in less than an hour. but overall after a little bit of changing in settings this monitor will not disappoint you...So go for it..,2
8176,The accessories are not useful.,Third class service & very arrogant customer service. I got defective monitor & it's shows 7 days replacement but when I try to do it no option showing & customer representative says it's can't be returned or replaced. Better to buy from flipkart,4
8177,Don't think go for it❤️,"Product ia good but it has all ports vertical so cables touch to wall. Stand is fashionable but not strong enough.

Saller is not providing bill and warranty card with stamp here. I want to return this product but believe in LG company and hoping that nothing will not be wrong with this product in 3years so that i am keeping this.
Amazon should take action against saller for this major mistake.",5
8178,Perfect balance between light gaming and coding,"I primarily bough this monitor for daily office work and light gaming( primarily CS ). It has now been a month since use and this fits perfectly well or the use. However, long continous usage causes eye strain

Pros:
- Wide monitor for daily use
- Preset picture setting for comfortable vision
- power saver mode to which puts screen to sleep if no signal is detected.

Cons:
- long continous usage causes eye strain even in reader mode but this may vary from person to person. One should take appropriate breaks between screen sessions",4
8179,Good monitor under budget with 75Hz refresh rate,"While this might be the amazons choice based on purchase, do not buy this monitor - colours are not accurate and text is not sharp - if you compare the text displayed on your laptop with this monitor, you can see the difference. In spite of doing calibration using windows, things did not change.

As for colours, they are completely off and there are no options like TV to adjust anything much from the device. As for LG provided software, that is not of any good",5
8180,Excellent product,"I have been a proud owner of the Dell S2240L monitor https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B009MXKJ2A for over 5 years. I had bought that Dell monitor way back during January 2015. But this L∙G∙ monitor (22MP68VQ) which I recently purchased during March 2020 {and it was delivered at my residence today itself} appears to be a lot worse than that Dell S2240L monitor. I can observe a yellowish tinge on the Right Half of this L∙G∙ 22MP68VQ monitor especially whilst surfing the internet on white-coloured backgrounds\interfaces. And while playing videos, the black colour [as and when applicable; whenever or whereever it is present] towards the Left Half of the screen seems to be of dull/diluted black colour whereas the black colour [as and when present; whereever present] towards the Right Half seems to be of rich/proper black colour. The brightness is also automatically changing without any doing of mine. The stand is also far worse than what the stand\support of my previous Dell monitor used to be.",5
8181,Review after 3 years. Red horizontal line on display which was replaced by LG.,"For the price, this is an amazing deal. Got it on sale for ₹7k and I'm very happy with it. It is quite bright, so much so that i barely use it over 80% brightness. The thin bezels give it a very modern look which is awesome. It is good for content consumption, but don't expect to be doing colour accurate editing on this. This monitor is a great all rounder Full HD package.

I gave it a 4 star for the gaming criteria since this monitor isn't built for gaming exactly and it is not going to push anything above 1080p 60FPS because well, those are the specs lol.

The only thing I didn't particularly like about it is the included stand, but this monitor is also VESA compatible so atleast you're not limited to that particular stand, and you can use this monitor in a dual (or more) screen setup however you want. All in all, this is a great purchase and I would definitely recommend it.",3
8182,Wrost Durability - Screen broke just by touch,"Lightweight monitor. Good connectivity options of HDMI, VGA and 3.5mm output audio jack. It's a calibrated monitor so the picture quality is very good out of the box. I did not have to fiddle with any settings except for changing the various modes. Haven't had any issues like dead pixels or lines etc. It comes with a HDMI cable. My usage is restricted to surfing sites, watching YouTube and a little bit of streaming so I am happy with its performance. Haven't played any games so can't comment on gaming performance.",1
8183,Great as a Second Monitor but not the best one out there,"I am now using this monitor for the last 4 days and most of the time playing games and watching movies.The picture quality is superb and colour balance is awesome.This monitor is perfect for gaming.One thing I also want to inform that those who are trying to use this monitor with win 7 or win 8 64bit,just connect the monitor but 'Dont install 'the driver bcoz the driver is designed for win10.So there will be serious conflict between graphics driver and monitor driver which might cause any game to stop working properly.But with the inbuilt motherboard driver and operating os(win 7 or win 8 64 bit) the monitor is very very very good and will work perfectly.The audio port is not working with D-sub connection,it might work with HDMI but as I already use 5.1 sound system separately so this is not a big deal for me.",4
8184,Worst. In 6 months the led picture panel gone.,"Excellent picture quality with easy settings. If you are a big fan of movies, than your search ends here. Better than Dell & hp. International looks & features makes it more attractive. Games image resolution wise, its best from others.

Your HDMI cable is in inside the box with manual book. Price has gone up little because of GST issues but still its a best choice.",1
8185,Guys Truly it's the Best Monitor in the Market,"This is my second purchase (14th Jun 2021) i.e. in 10 months. I had bought it earlier in Aug 2020 after reading the reviews and compared it with Benq GW2283 , & LG 22MK600M (latest i.e. 2018 model).

In terms of usability features are more in this e.g. display bit depth of 8 bits, multi connectivity options (VGA, HDMI, DVI, Audio Out Ports), 4 split screen functionality, 178 degree viewing angle etc.

Do note that the split screen functionality being LG software driven the multi sub screens cannot be detected in the VDI/Horizon clients (corporate software for remote access). But for home use it's a good feature as you can open reference sites, documents in the split windows within the screen to refer to while working on your primary laptop screen.

Multi ports make sense e.g. as in my T430 laptop I have a display port, and DVI port, there is no HDMI. So with display port adaptor I am able to connect to this monitor using HDMI cable and while other with DVI and end result I have two screens connected to the laptop

Quite happy with the purchase.",5
8186,Excellent Monitor,"This LG monitor is wonderful.
I'm using it for office work.

Likes:
- Image quality (disable the superfine resolution to get smooth fonts)
- Borderless compact design
- value for money

Dis-likes:
- no HDMI CEC, so I have to turn on/off the monitor separately from the PC.
- no built in speakers",5
8187,Dont BUY,"movies look amazing!
i re-watching all my fav movies again because they look so good on this. ( i had an old tn panel screen)
no issues with installing, very simple, plug and play!

if you have an amd card, freesync is great!
if you have an nvdia card, you wont get freesync, but turn on freesync, it'll give 75hz refresh rate! ( gsync works on nvidia through display port, this has only hdmi/vga)",1
8188,A budget beast!,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Jus amazing, perfect colors and details the blacks r so good. Ips panel does the job well. Came with sealed box perfectly delivered with care no damage anything from appario seller. Display is perfect for gaming it has 75hz refresh Rate also with screen tearing it play the games butter smooth. Colors r so perfect not over saturated.

Worth for the game, video editing also. Bang for buck close ur eyes and go for it. Best led monitor under 10k. With amd sync, 75hz refresh rate full HD screen anti glare. So just buy it without any second thought",5
8189,Dark shadoow spot in right side of the screen,"Superb for rss around 6500-7000
Very good color reproduction
Suitable for bright rooms , really nice during day times
Expected more control buttons instead of one on the body of monitor
Feels Heavy strain 4 eyes during n8s
Some yollowish color on corners
Wait for offers then go for it.......",3
8190,Very good IPS panel,Initially I had given 5 stars. At first sight it was okey. But brightness was very high. I reduced the brightness. Still it is very much unpleasant to eyes. My eyes got irritated and burnt due to this monitor. After some months I got realized that it badly effected my eyes. This is my second LG IPS monitor. The first one also had the same problem. Now I realized that IPS panel is a big problem for eyes. I found myself comfortable when using TN Panel and VA panel monitors. Now I changed this monitor. It was really a night mare. Dont buy this.,5
8191,Very good product,"Hey guys if you are looking for a best monitor in the world for accurate colors for gaming , pro editing this is the perfect monitor for you under 10k rs personally i purchased this monitor in 7k in Diwali sale it will provide you pre calibrated ips panel which is extremely important for accuracy of colors and also you can enable 75hz refresh rate by enabling freesync by the way this monitor supporting fresssync as well as gsync so no issues which card you are using and also you can reduce the response time from 5ms to 2ms with the help of drivers in cd will be provided with box so also it has hdmi port as well as vga so you can easily display so at last this is the best ipl panel monitor with 75hz under 10k so go for it if you are under 10k okey 😊 ☺ 🤗 😊 🤗 😊 🤗 😊 🤗 😊 🤗 😊 🤗 😊",5
8192,superb product,"As described - very crisp display, doesnt glare. If there is direct light falling on it then yes you will need to readjust but otherwise fantastic.

Did not use for games so not sure about that.

The on/off button is in a little secretive place which helps maintain its asthetics but not too convenient to reach. I do not turn it on/off often since the computer shuts down and takes it to standby, so works for me.

Overall, great buy - nothing to regret.",5
8193,Monitor stand very shakey.,"This is a very nice monitor for its price point. at just over 8K (10+k now), this is an excellent buy. The pictures are not very sharp but are crisp enough for everyday use. The colours are not vibrant or true colours but they are not bad at all. I'd say good to very good, if not excellent. Text and font are crisp and not very sharp. The panel and switches feel cheap and flimsy but it works without problems.

The one issue with this monitor is the stand. As you type, with the slightest shake of table, the monitor keeps shaking up. The stand isn't study or rigid to hold the monitor firmly when the table moves (I have a height adjustable table)

The monitor is wall mountable, has only one HDMI port and also supports VGA. It even has audio output (not USB). Overall a good buy for this price point (8K) and not 10.5K at what it is now at the time of writing this review. In two days they hiked the price by 2000 rupees!",3
8194,Pretty decent Monitor,"It's picture quality was very awesome. The main thing I liked most is anti glare option which makes this monitor as perfect. Mostly I enjoying viewing cinemas in monitor. So I choose this which completely satisfy my requirements. It's easy to assemble and ready to use. It's 22"" display play most significant role with this budget. I really satisfying enjoying viewing cinemas in this monitor. And also I am a fan LG which has a famous and quality brand in all products.. A great expections is I had it in during delivery time that is package type and package quality because we are eagerly waiting to receive a product if any damages happens, then it. Will be a most sad situation. In this I m really thanks to Amazon to deliver a wonderful product with quality package and safe package.",5
8195,No Built in audio,"Clear and comfortable screen display. There is a button below the monitor screen which not only power on the display, but all display adjustments are done from this single button. Hope this button will not go faulty with frequent use. Multiple screen modes like reader modes and cinema etc.which adjusts screen color and brightness for the required mode accordingly.Power button light can be enabled or disabled.
Got for an total deal of abot 6300.

Overall good. Will update with more details later after few months usage.
Note:HDMI cable included in the package.",4
8196,It's for what it is,"Amazon India DID NOT allow to post my following authentic feedback and rejected on 26.08.2020, trying to post again now.

Dear All, I bought this product on 06.08.2020 (prime day sale) and same was delivered on 10.08.2020.

Am Not a pure techie btw, hence skipping technical aspects of review.. many others have detailed; let's take a cue from them.

BELIEVE ME NOT GIVING IMMEDIATE REVIEWS.

Writing only after 2 months of usage.. that too after expiry of Amazon returns date... so this is genuine.

I experienced following problems.. feel many others reading this would have experienced too.. till this moment of writing this review i find there are 3.8k buyers incl. me... so !.

1. Amazon IN says Included Components for this PC Monitor has "" Monitor, Stand, Power Cord, Connectivity Cables "" - however just received HDMI.. enquired with various stakeholders of team LG India for other cables - sorry only eerie silence received as revert despite escalation; felt no point coordinating with team LG.

If you enquire with Amazon IN, they too do not have this info, just would redirect us to LG. Even if you mention this to LG corporate marketing team, eerie silence would be received as revert.

2. My system configuration is Pentium dual core 2.6Ghz - 64 bit Win 7 Ultimate OS; using D-Sub port for CPU and monitor connectivity. Despite having this config; also compatible with LG Onscreen control dedicated software for its PC video monitors (as per LG India portal), still Onscreen did not work.

3. Spoke umpteen times to various stakeholders of team LG India (incl. Technical trainer and technical team troubleshooter) - sorry i was told this Video PC monitor can be used only for extended viewing say with Laptop - when probed why it was mentioned NO where in LG india (or) Amazon India portal in their product pages - the end result was i was asked to return the monitor for refunds... and a callback supposedly to be received did not happen in last 1.5 months.

4. I challenge most would disbelieve me with this kind of brand LG service; fine with it, as I have documentary proofs. I already wrote to regulatory bodies like NCH and noted it's not worth complaining as you donot receive support despite if you share umpteen proofs and updates... Only time waste !!!.

5. With Onscreen control absence.. am unable to use display Presets and VERY IMPORTANTLY Screen Split has not even worked in last 2 months as it is not available in physical menu. I could not even see now how screen split would be like in my present 22MP68VQ monitor despite 2 months passed.

6. I repeatedly get a command in PC during system boot that my video monitor is not set to 1920*1028.. this is despite we set the resolution rate to 1920*1028 in system.. pc monitor never adjusts to our resolution set on systems.. sadly this 1920*1028 is not available to be set in physical menu and onscreen software is the only go !.

7. I found a twitter user complaining about a LG TV/Monitor (made in China) product becoming defective in 2 years and was asking for replacement... As Country of Origin for this product is China - not sure how long will it sustain; though this product has 3 Year Warranty...

8. Am from Chennai and have in the last 2 months spoken over 2 hours with various stakeholders of LG India team and have sent umpteen mails still as of date even after 2 months only miscommunications, misguidance, contradictory assistance, NO timelines and eerie silence were received as revert from LG India team.

9. Even if you escalate to National consumer helpline, no use as LG does nothing in terms of service as one of its manager went to the extent of even suggested for returning to take refund instead of trouble shooting.

10. LG service engineer spent 1.5 hours trouble shooting the problem on 02.09.2020 and was NOT successful despite he said OSC is an open source application which would run on all OS.

11. The same service engineer called a week later and suggested to check with their inhouse CPU in my place, when we asked for resolution he proved a turncoat saying if it works with their cpu then my OS is an issue, reviewers could note the versions received from team LG India.

12. We wrote to their Senior management and corporate teams with all proofs still nothing happened in past 2 months.

13. Our complaint to NCH & MCA with umpteen proofs went in favour of LG as NCH asked us to approach NCDRC.

End result: if anyone believes brand LG being global their products and service levels would be appreciable, then think twice..

I own almost almost 60k worth of various consumer appliances of LG still I had to face this obnoxious music from LG team india and its local staffs.",5
8197,Good monitor bt yellowish on right side for split screen reading mode have to improve,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Well i bought this monitor for my playstation 4 (ps4) and i wasnt expecting so much ..but boy oh boy what a monitor it is ...worth every penny that i spend

Color - 5/5
Antiglare 4/5

8198,Best Bang for Buck Dual Monitor Setup Folks!,"Hello,
It's been about a year I bought this monitor. Overall it's okay product. All of sudden it has started showing a vertical line on the monitor. As the warranty is for 3 years, an the seller please let me know if this is covered under warranty?
Thanks & Regards,
--Vijay",5
8199,Amazing LED monitor at fair price,The monitor stand is not firm one and very light weight. After receiving the product contacted Amazon to return it and to get another monitor with a good quality monitor stand. Amazon refused to EXchange it. As per theIR rule if you buy it then that all. Very disappointed. how one can see the quality of the product though a online image. Next time I should be very careful before buying any electronic product from Amazon.,5
8200,Very good,"I was previously using LG LCD monitor 19.5 inch since last 7-8 yrs and it was still working except some issues on display which were not that quite visible while using bt still went ahead to upgrade myself with a new one. LG has seriously being the best in the market with this budget LED 22 inch display.

I got this in PRIME day sale for 6.5k with cashback, so it was a great deal for me, as its usually priced around 8500 in normal days.

PROS:-
1) Best Clarity with different modes
2) Perfect to watch movies on.
3) Bezeless display gives you more space.
4) Has HDMI and audio in connection too

CONS:-
1) The stand is bit wobbly if shaken the LED can fell flat on the screen so be careful about it.

This was my analysis after using it for a month and I am really happy with this :)",5
8201,Great product,"I was in the market to get a monitor for my WFH purpose, to use as a primary monitor and close the laptop monitor.
I was surprised by the built quality, display quality and design. The design is what makes it stand out.The best part of the monitor was the toggle button/selector for the settings of the monitor...Its like the cursor we had in old blackberry phones(Don't exactly know what they are called :p)..
Now coming to display...I have placed it opposite to the window and with sun rays it's pretty much bright enough to work...
The height can not be adjusted but there is little scope of inclination adjustment that can be done.
I would buy the same monitor again when I go for a dual monitor setup.
P.S. -> I have been using this monitor for the past 6 months",4
8202,"Low price, full quality.",Ordered on 28th april 2019 recieved today 1 april 2019 and have to say this is a very good looking and high performance machine...and have very less price than other monitor in the market...overall its very good product ...packaging was perfect ....no damage or scratch,5
8203,Below average monitor,"I'm reviewing after using the monitor for 2 months...it's really a good product....it has nice viewing angles.. IPS Display is added to its advantage But two things which I noticed is that the monitor stand is not sturdy...So the monitor shakes a little bit ....you have to be careful while placing the monitor and the second one is there is a 3mm gap between the screen and side panels on all the 4sides but this has got nothing to do with the performance of the monitor. If you are not worried about these two issues then you can go for this one...It will satisfy you in every way for like gaming, movies etc etc",1
8204,Disappointed,"I use it for daily work, check emails, watch prime video or netflix video etc. the anti-glare panel is really nice and I enjoy it over my old dell monitor. color production is good with good picture quality. Just one thing I did n't like is the driver comes with a cd and I do not have a cd player. I used it for both my monitor and laptop as a secondary display and it looks better than my dell laptop screen.",3
8205,Good but shaky,"Good for work from home-office work

I got this to work with a Mac book and it works well. I didn't try out the multi screen feature (4 screens in 1).

The package also includes a HDMI cable and I bought another cable ( the product description didn't specify the type of cable provided ).

The monitor has an audio slot that you can connect to speakers if needed.

The only thing I would have liked in addition is a height adjustment , but that's not a big problem in my case. It might help to place this at a slightly higher plane than the height of the laptop / keyboard",4
8206,Best IPS panel monitor available right now.,"This is a great FHD monitor from LG at this price. I have purchased it at 9100₹. It has HDMI input with 75 Hz refresh rate. But for that it needs AMD Graphics card connected to it’s HDMI port.
Overall an amazing IPS LED monitor at an amazing price.",5
8207,Overall good display - but downscaling sucks,"The monitor is awesome. I use to do lot of Lightroom stuff, so perfect for my use. I do not do much gaming so cannot comment on that, but overall is good for viewing videos as well as photos. There are different modes and I am overall very satisfied with the product. I use it as my primary monitor. The viewing angles are also quite good, since this is an IPS display. I got it for RS 7369 in Diwali offer and also got another RS 740 discount for using Amazon Pay ICICI bank card, so overall an awesome deal for me.",4
8208,Okay Product !,"This is probably the best under 10000 monitor out there. 75hz refresh rate is quite good since this is not aimed for super high end gaming sets. Also the pictures are quite good and the IPS display is top notch. Even anti glare works fine. It's got a vesa wall mount but the stand it comes with feels weak as it wobbles if my desk is hit. Audio output isn't extraordinary but no one will wire up headphones to it anyways. A very good 1080p monitor with a pleasing look. Also , it has a number of modes and even 2 reader modes which is a lifesaver. The LG provided software can divide the screen upto 4 screens. It's got support for HDMI, VGA and display port.",1
8209,Best budget gaming monitor,"Ordered during the COVID19 period, product box barcode was tampered and seller has pasted its own information on the same.Monitor display worked good for 7-8 days and suddenly display went wrong, it started flickering and was not able to view anything as it became too dark and thin lines started showing up.

Returned Monitor though waiting for the refund.
Monitor display when working was good, purpose was to have a extra screen which worked for a short tenure.
UI menu is not too friendly and had to search in google for optimal setup for viewing, reader modes are not good.",5
8210,Not original Quality,"At first I didn't like the monitor coz it had backlight bleeding issues and also it had an dead pixel on right top corner, i was worried. After that I spoke with the customer care and they easily replaced the product, the second one came and I was fascinated that it didn't have any faults, the picture quality was great and it serves my purpose well. I do gaming casually not high but like moderately and watch movies and I also do designing using cad softwares so for all this the color reproduction is quite good and for @7k what can I expect more, completely satisfied with the product.

cons: texts are sometimes harder to read and for high end gaming go for better monitors.",2
8211,Amazing budget monitor,I am writing this product on the day I received the product. I am using it with mac mini (2018) no issues. I have tested it for browsing and movies. I have not tested it for games as I am not into it. I really liked the reader mode and very wide range of adjustment features provided with the monitor. The button given for the feature adjustment however does not look long lasting. I have given four star because they could have given a button of better quality for adjustment. The clarity with mac mini is fantastic for 1080p and 720p. They additionally have 1920 x 1600 (very good for reading). The hdmi cable along with it is okay but I prefer my belkin cable which is more smooth in terms of plugging in or out with mac and monitor. Overall seems a nice monitor for the price let us now see how long it can perform at this rate.,5
8212,Great monitor at good price.,"Likes:
The picture quality is very good. Would recommend for single player games. (Not for competitive games)
Dislikes:
Only 1 hdmi port.
Adapter's wire quality is so cheap.
Stand is not stable when trying to tilt monitor.
If u have budget of around 10000 go for lg24mk600m but if ur budget is max of 8000 go for this monitor.",5
8213,Faulty product and Worst Service,"This product is amazing. I am using this product from last 3 months and this product didn't disappointed me till now.
But I recommend you to invest little bit more in monitor and prefer to buy Full hd or 4k quality monitor.
You might not be happy with graphics quality with this monitor.
Packing of product was also good.
Worth buying this prouduct.",1
8214,Loved this monitor but for the second time in a row the panel is bad,"Nice monitor but lost a star because the ports at the back point outwards instead of downwards, so it really needs around 5 inches of space between the screen and the wall, especially if you plug a fire stick in there like I did. Also, does not support HDMI-CEC for automatic input selection, but the switch between inputs is fairly fast and easy.",1

8216,5 star for Video but 2 star for Text,"I have been using this monitor since 3 months. The monitor serves its purpose very well. It has adequate brightness and is color calibrated. The viewing angles are good almost 180 degrees as it is IPS display. Comes with 3 years of warranty. The only Con is the button and lack of USB input. If there was, i could have used it as wireless display. There is only one joystick like button which serves all purposes. The button could go bad very quickly on usage. LG provides an application to configure the settings which doesn't work at all. So you have to use the button for configuring monitor.",2
8217,Good to use,"This monitor supports only VGA cable. If I connect HDMI - Flickering starts and it will kill your patience. Even Lord Buddha will get angry, when this Monitor Flickers.

Initially I was using NVIDIA Geforce GT 710 2GB - Flickered
Then upgraded to NVIDIA Geforce GT 730 GDDR5 4GB - Flickered
Again I upgraded to NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1660 OC Super 6GB - Still Flickering

Please tell me, what will stop this stupid monitor from flickering?

8218,Quality is v gud,"Suitable for AMD graphics Card user who wants to use free sync. Picture Quality is alright, Sometimes when on High brighness and high refresh rate panel gets heat up a little you can feel heat on the outside case, No protect whatsoever for eyes except MATTE FINISH which helps by not reflecting or refracting image or light falling on it. But in terms of eye protect It provided none. Causes Eye Strain in long Use. Affected my eye sight Have to use minimum powered glasses with Anti-Glare coating. Better Buy no power Anti-Glare glasses before start using it.
It was cheapest in the quality thats why I bought it because at first I needed it for occassion use. Better invest more money If you are gonna use it for long time or gaming, get some high range Product.",5
8219,"Great monitor, very very satisfied.","I like everything about it. At this price point, the features offered make it excellent when it comes to value for money. But, what I did not like is the pathetic product design.
First of all the stand base is a light weight plastic, which is very fragile and barely manages the weight of monitor. It puts the monitor under unstable equilibrium. Meaning, a slight push and your monitor falls bam on the table!!

So, I had to buy a heavy stand separately. But what happened next left me wondering about how a company of stature like LG could approve such a product design. The base stand when pulled out leaves a stand neck attached to the bottom of the monitor. Now, this stand neck has been fastened on screws from inside of the back panel. That means, for me to be able to use my new stand, I need to disassemble the monitor first, unscrew the stand neck, assemble it back again and then mount it on my new stand or even on the wall for that matter.
I had to take my monitor to LG service center to get that neck removed.",5
8220,"You can buy for the brand. ""OK"" at this price point.",In image product look like gud but aftr gt it that size and product are totaly different.. Am cancel the product but they are not take the product...customare care tolf electronic itms return option is nt there ..so totally 8000 waste...fraud,3
8221,Bad product and very bad LG Service of LG 22 inch IPS Monitor-22MP68VQ,"This review is not even required understanding the fact that it's an LG panel for such a low price, the gaming on this is seriously an experience altogether. The picture clarity is top notch and staring at it for hours don't even hurt your eyes. It's only drawback is that it has only one HDMI output but that as well you can buy any cheap HDMI extension from the market and there you have it.
People planning to buy this do not hesitate, it's one hell of a monitor, you will not be able to do anything else once you buy this, you will be hooked up to it forever. I hardly write reviews but I was so impressed with this that I could not stop. Cheers!!",1
8222,Superb Choice,"Very Fantastic Monitor Cum TV. HD. Quality is so better then others, If any go for purchase can go no doughy. but thing is minus is no inbuilt speakers but any way best. Another thing is seller not supplied VGA cable in the box. Please i am requesting to seller if possible send me VGA cable to my delivery address . dew to monitor is good i dont like to return or replace the product now.",5
8223,Good for the price,It's a good monitor for watching movies and playing some casual gaming. It's got some modes for reading and I find it very useful when reading some articles or programming. It's got AMD freesync so games look smooth. The refresh rate is decent at 75 Hz. It's a good mtilurpose monitor.,4
8224,Stunning quality after hours of calibration.,"The picture quality is sharp with thin bezels. This monitor is good for all purposes normal and gaming alike.
There is no problem with the display and the contrast, colours , modes etc can be customised.

The product comes only with an HDMI cable and VGA cable is not included. The odd thing is the design of the stand. It could have been better placed. Also this product can be wall mounted, but it does not come with a mount.",5
8225,Screen backlight bleeding....,"Solved my purpose 99.9 %..

If anyone looking a monitor for Playing consoles please go for this product.
I was very confused that which monitor i should buy for playing ps4, after a 5 days of searching finally i desided to buy this one.. trust me guys a saw more then 20 monitors online and finally I selected this one..
I saw lots of negative and positive reviews but my opinion is 99.9 % ok..

Guys, dont look for inbuilt speakers in monitor as none of any monitor can give you a better sound like TV gives go for a good external speaker.. as i already have a ‘BOSE SOUND LINK SPEAKER’ so it gives me a awesome sound quality.. thanks for the aux jack in monitor.
I have played games in this monitor for 6 hours continue and no eyes problem infact in my sony hd tv I face a problem sometimes in my eyes..

Thats all guys..

Go for it without any confusion.

Go for it...",2
8226,Best monitor under 8k budget,"Though advertised as sRGB over 99% here, this monitor pales in comparison to my LG 25inch ultrawide which is also sRGB over 99%. Looking at the specs page on LG's site for this monitor, the color gamut is 72% of CIE1976 and not CIE1931 which is comparable to sRGB over 99%. Interestingly, the 23inch model does have the latter and will have better colors.

The monitor also has issue with 75Hz where you can see faint lines running through the image.",5
8227,Not wall-mountable,"Monitor is great for usual Office tasks. Color accuracy is questionable so not ideal for video or photo editing type of jobs or gaming. For standard office jobs this is a great monitor for the price. Came in original packaging with CD to load the software.

My concern is on build quality, after 3 months a crack has appeared at the rear. Monitor is still working great.",1
8228,There are better alternatives out in the market,"Perfect budget monitor. You get more for what you pay. Gaming is buttery smooth and AMD sync work perfectly. Nvidea card work on 60fps and does not feel any difference between the two (75fps & 60fps). I have my CPU with AMD card and my Laptop with Nvidia card and the monitor works on both with no notable differences or Lag during gameplay.
Good picture quality and matt screen makes this monitor a beast for budget guys and school gammers... There is a separate mode for movie/photo/reading/gaming which is absolutely insane. Just a few clicks and monitor adjusts its brightness and contrast according to the mode. It also adjust its brightness according to the content of display, the more white content will lower the brightness and darker content are displayed with higher brightness and it does this automatically all the time. You can blindly trust this beast for the price you pay!",2
8229,Monitor is not showing display on right side/Amazon service is not good.,"Not very impressed. I have connected it to my laptop and can find visible difference in its picture quality compared to laptop screen. Monitor has a little glowing edges (especially top bar), I had to replace the first delivery due to this but second one was also similar (though slightly less glow). It is made in china which is also causing some guilt in my heart (which is almost every monitor).",1
8230,The best monitor under 8500,Good monitor. Support G-Sync over hdmi i played GTA V and there was no screen tearing. 75Hz refresh rate. Text is crisp and clear from 2ft distance. Colors are vibrant. Just consumes 10.5W in energy saving mode. HDMI cable is provided. No color bleeding. I’m happy with my purchase.,5
8231,prime customer review,Please don't buy lg 22mp68vq because 1st time i got defective product which have dead pixel 1 coming on 3rd day and also so much bleeding on top and bottom. 2nd product comes with top left hand side bleeding only. But i accepted then after 15 days i realized that half side left is white but half right side is yellowish it's affect only on white background. Picture quality is average. Don't go with reviews also on youtube like IG that's why am regretting my purchase.,5
8232,Excellent product for WFH requirements,"Image quality is very good. However, for Retina Display Macbooks, the images on monitor are not Sharp if native resolution is kept for both displays. (Retina Displays are of higher resolution vis a vis HD resolutions of these Monitors).
With Windows laptops, the image quality is quite good and works very well.
Overall, Positive experience.",5
8233,Overall good may be watching videos from distance and not good for computer professionals who work longs hours,"This is one of the best budget monitors, trust me or not, it's really good. As a UI/UX Designer and a Programmer, I feel very good about this monitor. I also game on this mostly csgo and GTA 5 and this can run at 75hz. The first time I launched csgo on this monitor it felt more smoother I was confused I went to check Nvidia settings and surprisingly it said ""75hz"" OMG I could feel the difference way more, now I've decided to get a 144 hz monitor too.

Will write a update feedback after a month or more if I have time.",3
8234,A great product at this price range!,"One of the best Monitor price-to-performance +This Review according to My Monitor+
75 hz refresh rate
1 ms response time (it's really grateful for Gaming)
1. Freesync is supported. This means if you are using an AMD graphics card, your refresh rate increase 75Hz.
2. Reader/Custom modes are available. As a user who uses the PC for gaming along with web browsing, movie watching, programming, a reader mode is very much required. This monitor takes care of that.
3. Comes with a decent HDMI male-to-male connector. The cable quality might not be world-class but does a decent job of responsive video data transfer, when it comes to quick display changes (like gaming).
4. Minimal bezel at the edges.
5. Very Beautiful and faithful color representations.
6. All in all, a great monitor. I could not find anything to reduce even a half star from the product rating. 5 stars from me. Been using this for more than two weeks now.

I m not found any cons in my monitor
It's really very great monitor.
Value for money...",4
8235,perfect for home office set up,"Packaging was good. I was worried about damage during the transit. Monitor is working great and its the best in this price range. More importantly this monitor have vesa mount. You can mount it on the w
all or buy dual monitor arm and mount it using the vesa mount. This is something that other monitors in this price range lacks. On screen control software is also helpful you can keep upto 8 windows easily using that on screen control software. Purchased for 7.2k (7999 listed price+10% sbi cashback) overall satisfied with the product.

Update: monitor stand is poor. Monitor shakes(wobble) every time i type. First i thought it was the desk. After changing the desk the problem is still there.",4
8236,LG IPS Monitor,"Saw lot of negative reviews for many monitors on Amazon , was not really sure which one to buy..
22 or 24 inch that was the question, settled for 22 as it was within budget and not too expensive.
Decision turned out to be right, the screen size is perfect , primarily wanted it as a secondary screen for my laptop to do work from home, so this does the job quite well.
The product was packed well from LG and was not damaged or opened when it arrived.
HDMI cable was included in the box.
Easy to setup.
Everything else is fine , meets my primary purpose of a secondary screen.

8237,Garbage product,"if ur looking for a monitor this monitor is best under 10k for both gaming and color grading. i have been using this monitor for 10 days now, and here is my review with some tips for better experience.
1. the panel quality is really great for the price (Factory Calibrated colors) colors are spot on with great viewing angles
2. bezel less design looks really good
3. build quality is good, but the stand quality is just decent it wobbles
4. It comes with HDMI cable so this monitor has a headphone jack too for ur speakers or headphones
5. Some people complaint about white glow visible when viewing something black on screen, it is not a product issue at all it happens with all ips displays on higher end monitors it is less visible, and u will only notice this when the display is showing only black color

TIPS AND TRICKS
1. Better Colors - This display comes with black stabilizer (Gaming Feature) turn that to 0/off cause it makes blacks a bit greyish so for better colors turn that off
2. Avoid Screen Flashing - Sometimes the monitor automatically Lowers the brightness which causes screen flash to avoid this go to monitor settings and turn off smart energy saving
3. Unlock 75hz - To unlock 75hz, turn on free sync from monitor menu or via the the lg desktop app and set the response time to faster, then (if u have win 10) right click on desktop and go to display settings>Advanced display settings>Display adapter properties> go to monitor tab and select 75hz and press ok. after that go to nvidia or amd graphic control pannel and see if 75hz is selected if not, then select 75hz and enjoy",1
8238,OP,"It has been two months since I purchased the monitor. For the last two days, I am noticing red/purple and blue and horizontal lines in my monitor. I looked at overall positive * star rating, didnt focus on the -ve ratings for the monitor. I think I may have done a mistake. The exact same issue I am seeing is reported by few uses as I browse through the review section.

I will have to work customer service now. Let me see what they have to tell.",4
8239,Value for money and decent monitor,"Before placing the order the following doubt came to mind like the poor packing, handling & shipping damages, IPS glow & backlight bleeding , poor black etc as shared by the negative reviews . But when received the product I didn't found any. The monitor box came with extra packing box no damage to the product , picture & video quality is awesome no bleeding or ips glow. So many settings. 0-15 brightness is enough for normal work & no stress on eyes. The import date is latest. Extremely value for money , glad that I had placed the order . Let's see how it will perform in long run, will try to update later.",4
8240,"Totally bad product, I still have no idea how this product got 4.5-star ratings.","The product reached on time as expected. It was worth waiting too ! Basically got the screen for my work as extension for my laptop .. it definitely helps in working more efficiently & bezelless monitor is a breeze to work with.
The base is quite sturdy & Monitor is almost weightless .
Didn't wait for the sale to begin as I felt the need for it & quite satisfied with it.",1
8241,Best budget monitor ever,"This is my first monitor. I used a TN panel on an old laptop until now and this feels like a huge upgrade. The display is evenly lit and I do not observe any backlight bleed.

Pros:
1. Easy to set up and use
2. Good picture quality and contrast
3. Joystick navigation - More useful than you may think
4. Modern looking with thin bezels
5. Vesa mountable
6. Good antiglare while still keeping colours at a good saturation level

Cons:
1. Not enough range of brightness. I would prefer a much dimly lit display in the night.
2. Ports facing backwards - I would rather have the ports facing downwards so that I can keep the monitor closer to the wall

This display will be enough for anyone who is just looking for an add-on display or a good single display.",5
8242,Good product.,Awesome for 1080p gaming.. Though I was hesitant to buy this as it has amd free sync.. Which works with only amd graphics cards.. And I have an Nvidia 1060.. But ordered it due to its looks and amazing bezel less style.. And of course it's from LG so I bought it and ya I must say it looks amazing.. And build quality is great.. Just go for it and you won't regret.. Best one below 10k out there,5
8243,Nice LG IPS panel but top backlit bleed is annoying.,"LG warranty is not real warranty, the support will be worst. This monitor got on curve black line and total screen got blue blurry lines. LG support simply saying this is physical damage and not covered under warranty. But they can't show the brocken part physically, simply saying physical damage basis on black line. I believe that black line and screen faulty due to heating in summer. But, they simply saying physical damage. Monitor work till night, i slept without power off, when i wake up next day, its not working.
Worst Warranty support by LG.",4
8244,No problem so far.,"Am not going to repeat the tech-specs here but I must say that this monitor has everything that most of us don't even know of or never bother to use those features.
Where it shines is picture quality and that's what matters in the end. I loved the brightness and crispness of the screen. The blacks are really black and there is no screen bleeding.",5
8245,One of the best monitor for all the purposes.,"This monitor just made my day and I hope this will never disappoint me. I was planning to buy this monitor since a year. I could have bought but didn't because of its price. I heard that people have bought this for 6500 INR so I waited for a long to buy this dude and believe me got it at a decent price of 7000 INR. Order got delivered within 3days but I was shocked to see the packaging it was terrific I was only hoping the product well inside the box and yes it was. Superb picture quality , perfect saturation level, gaming with this monitor is like 🔥. No cons ( I will not forcefully bring out one). Go for it blindly if you are getting it in a good deal otherwise wait..",5
8246,"Amazing, very good if you are a programmer. or a gamer.","Go for it if you're getting it under 8K There is No competition of this model. Bought in August and got product manufactured in July only, which is great. If you are confused between BenQ and this one go for this one. 22 inch is more than enough for programming and home use.",5
8247,Good picture quality but stand can be more strong,"One of the good options when it comes to buying monitors. The price might seem a bit high but the product is of top quality. Monitor can be customized to one's preferences using the menu options present. It's a proper FHD 1080p. The bezel less borders make it better. All features described are present.

Only bad thing for me is that there is only 1 HDMI port. Would've preferred another one instead of the DVI. Also the screen can't be adjusted too much vertically but that's not really an issue for me.",3
8248,Budget friendly and colour output.,"It is working fine . It's aspect ratio is not good for reading. It is bit wide and images, texts may appear bit stretched. In Linux it is not suitable to read anything . In windows it is okay once you got aquainted with it. So buy if your intention is gaming otherwise think again",4
8249,Budget buy,Ahh...it's really sexy. I use it to watch films at night like a bed tv. Ofcourse the prime purpose is to design UI and write codes with better view. I am happy with the purchase.,5
8250,Value for money!,"Value for money, Good display. I really like the minimum bezels.
A single joystick button in bottom to control the power and all the functions.
Good options for Connectivity ports.
Came with HDMI cable.
Display quality is good, I’m using the display for programming.
Option for volume control but no speakers in the monitor. I think it’s for external speakers.",5
8251,Received defective product,"I am not happy with the quality of the panel. Colours are not accurate. Maybe this is the max quality I can get for 10k. Maybe I have been spoilt by the excellent screens my phones have.

The monitor looks awesome. But colour accuracy is average. I tried calibrating it, but not as expected. Shadow areas are too dark. If you try to brighten it up, other areas become too bright. There is no balance.",1
8252,Happy with this purchase,"After many research i purchased LG screen and i thought it'll be good vcoz i have 1 already.
Bt in this 22MP68VQ (Right side in photos) 1. has awkward things not adjusted screen auto pr manually so edges of the screen are cut.
2. Awkward yellow colortone which i never have in same LG brand other monitor and it's not even adjust after many setting.
3. It has ips display same has i have other bt this has screen bleeding issues.
4. Not good for video editing or animation work bcoz extra yellow color can change ur whole videos color.
Other thn that it's good for regular usage if edges are not cut.",4
8253,Overall good,had a horrible experience buying from amazon. the Screen had vertical lines within 10 days of use. However due to the excellent service of the LG customer I got my screen replaced. I will recommend to buy from trusted sources offline. wont buy any electronics from amazon in the foreseeable future I guess.,4
8254,Problem in power adaptor,"Product is very nice and it is as per the expectation.
I am not happy with the Delivery of the product from the Amazon. The product is Fragile product and delivery is suppose to be door step.
The Delivery guy drooped the product at Amazon collection point which is 12 Km away from the delivery address. Which was really never expected for such product.",3
8255,Very disappointed,"Would recommend it for console gaming(PS4), can not comment about the PC gaming experience as I don't use it for PC but the clarity and picture quality is unmatched to any screen in this particular segment of monitors(under 10,000) can also use it as a screen for Amazon prime or Netflix it is a 1080p screen with an IPS panel which shows more accurate colours and overall I would recommend it also the design is flawless and even Marilyn Monroe would be drab to this monitors beauty and elegance XD. On a serious note though it is a very good product and you can trust the brand too.",1
8256,It's nice cheif,"The monitor is good but the one I received might be having a defect. Because tiny insects are going inside of display and one of them literally died in the middle of the screen. You can watch it in the picture. When I approached the service center for getting it cleaned, they said we cannot clean it and the only thing that can be done is changing the entire display panel but they will not do that because it's a small issue for them. So you have to wait for few more insects to get inside and die and then they might consider to change the panel. This clearly shows that the product is a defective one. Better buy other ones like Dell or Samsung.",5
8257,BEST LG LED PC MONITOR,"I bought this monitor for my work during the nationwide lockdown as I was frustrated working with small screen of my laptop. This monitor is pure treat to the eyes. Very clear & cripsp images, makes working for long hours easy. Can sit back & relax in chair while working as the large monitor makes things easy to read from a distance as well.

I also use to watch Netflix & other platforms too. Works quite well for me & my wife as a TV in a decent sized bedroom. We connect bluetooth speakers for audio as this monitor lacks only audio to use as a TV. Although it has a 3.5mm audio output which you can connect to an external speaker. I even tried my Fire TV stock on it, which works very well.

For someone planning to work from for next few month, someone who works on UI development or runs a stratup, this is a good investment.",5
8258,Best Monitor in this price range,"Positives are: Great image quality, great sharp bezels, and quick response time and as the box says Cinema screen, yes indeed it is.
Negatives: Ports at the right at the back (not even down or up in back its straight perpendicular back) you would end up using ""L"" shaped plugs for convenience, not so bright day light inside a room makes you feel the need of more brightness, inbuilt speakers would have been added advantage, additional HDMI port is very much needed.",5
8259,Value for Money Product....,"I purchased this monitor in June'20. From December'20 I started noticing LCD displaying stuck images of screen I was using alternatively. Now in past few weeks this has turned really bad that all screens are overlapping bad and stuck causing discomfort. I'm unable see anything clearly as images of windows I was using is getting stuck without refreshing.

Also, I switched of the monitor for almost 2 hours including Power. But when I switched still the screen came with these overlapping stuck images it.

I looking support this.!",5
8260,Best Gaming Monitor & for other work,"This IPS monitor has superior display and color reproduction is brilliant. Also it looks stylish, thanks to its thin bezel and curved monitor stand. Doesn't have backlight bleeding issue. At this budget its the best monitor out there.
Just one issue is the LG onscreen control software is not working in windows 10_1903. Hope it will be fixed soon.",5
8261,Almost perfect! Go for it,"The packaging was worse. However, the product was delivered without any damage. Bought at ₹8000/- on Amazon Prime. The settings button is placed in the bottom of the monitor. The button is a single button which works like a joystick similar to the joystick of Nokia 6600. Used for seven days in a row and till now I have no complaints. Does the job decently. DPI could have been better but at this price range, it is a good deal. You can pay upto ₹10000 for this monitor. Hope this review is helpful. Warm wishes!",5
8262,Smart customer choice,"The monitor is good and sturdy considering the price range. It also has a wall mount arrangement.

However, I find the screen-height adjustment bit clumsy, while in case of other montiors of HP or Dell they provide sophisticated height adjustment solutions.

Overall the product is very good.",4
8263,Picture perfect,"This monitor displays faint vertical white lines at 75hz which are clearly visible on blue and yellow/orange colors. The reason seems to be the cheap IPS panel. Google for ""vertical lines 75hz"" and you will get many results on this topic. The right side of the monitor is bit yellowish as well. Thankfully backlight bleed isnt that visible.

Edit : After 2 years, monitor is now showing a horizontal line in the middle of the screen. My previous LCD monitor lasted for 8 years. Product is of cheap quality.",5
8264,Best for Watching Movie or Gaming or Doing Graphics Work,"An awesome product. Amazon was really superb to to meet with my expectations of adequate packaging and on-time deliverable.
The monitor is worth considering and showcases one of the best products with a price to performance ratio which will not let you down in any aspect. Excellent and stunning display with vibrant colors will satisfy everyone.
The joystick controls seems good and new , although I felt a bit low on its sturdy and fast movement. This monitor is not completely bezel-less but the overall looks are quite pretty and the thin bezels are not that bad at all.
Enjoying using the monitor last 5 months. Hope this helps!!!",5
8265,Affordable gaming monitor.,This monitor is good enough for general use but for gaming and media consumption it's terrible. There are two major issues with this monitor. First is that vertical lines appear on blue colour. I have seen this on multiple monitors of this make. Second is colour banding issue. This one appeared over time. It wasn't present earlier. Colour banding issue prevents display from giving smooth gradient. You can easily distinguish between different shades of colour.,4
8266,Go for it,With minimal usage in the last 6 months the monitor shows cracked screen display (monitor not physically cracked). Based on earlier reviews I had hoped it would last longer but that was not the case.,4
8267,Awesome full HD display,"I am using it as an extended monitor to my laptop.
1. It has got a great picture quality.
2. Colours are very precise.
3. Flicker free.

8272,Good at 7200,"Good product, but i thought that the picture comes with full view as a bezel less experience. But the reservations gets some blank space around the monitor that's why I can't enjoy as a basal this experience and some of the icons and their names is not totally visible because of the resolutions management is not so good but over I can say it's a good product.

Glossy black finish
Monitor stand is slightly old fashioned",5

So as the warranty is of 3 years i was lucky i saw and only 3 months was remaining i registered complain to lg toll free number they said within 72 hours a engineer will visit my home but no one came for 17-18 days i called them every alternate day and they always say we will do it in priority but didn't they gave me lg service centre number which is near to my home but no one used to pick up the call then I send a tweet to Lg on twitter and scolded lg service centre on call too one day so on that same day only a engineer came and checked my monitor and took pic and in the next 2 days he came with a new panel and replaced it and now my montitor looks new and working fine . The service was delayed i asked the engineer he said due to covid many complaind are there so it may be dealyed.,5
8275,LG..Life's Gooooooood :),"I just purchased by New Monitor before few days from Amazon. And now I'm using it as my primary display! But seriously the quality of this LG IPS Monitor is awesome. I'm using it for Graphic Design, Gaming, as well as movie watching but the experience, was very nice with this one!

You can go with this monitor if you need an average size & borderless computer monitor. This LG Computer Monitor comes with a few handy features like

- AMD Free sync
- Black Stabilizer
- 4 Screen Split

The monitor comes with FULL HD IPS Display which gives you crystal clear image & video quality.",5
8276,Decent product,"The overall quality and price to performance ratio of this monitor is really really impressive, although when it comes to looks this display can beat any panel out right now but, there are few things which should be mentioned that are, this is glossy finished display that's why whenever it comes in contact with dust it catches it and due to hollow neak of the stand the shoks or we often say it as some minor push results in shaking of whole display. Guys if you have good graphics card and decent speed of the internet you can play even 4k videos smoothly. Overall the display is really really good as compared to amount of money we are going to pay.",4
8277,Value for money,"I had recieved a faulty(the right half of the screen was dull and yellowish) piece previously,then I returned it and the new one is working fine.

This LG monitor looks good and does the job pretty well.No glare at all and the display is crisp enough for gaming and watching movies or editing videos.",4
8278,Good quality output but at times video is choppy while playing games,"I bought this monitor on the festival sale in 7200 rs including bank offer,the monitor i received had a screen issues.at first i didn't notice because it was not noticeable from more than 2 ft.after noticing the issue i ordered a replaced with in a week i got the replacement.now i didn't find any issue with the monitor its working perfectly as it should.if i find any issue in near future i will update my review.also one thing headphone port was not working with the vga connection, i had to use mini hdmi to hdmi cable to connect the monitor because my graphics card has mini hdmi port, now headphone port is working perfectly.",4
8279,Value for money 😍😍,"The monitor is good and has wide angle view. Well, you can read the specification very well and I will not hesitate to get it. Overall the monitor is sharp and have thin bezel which makes it more sleek and also if you have intention of setting up multiple screen this is perfect. The only complain that I have is the stand, which is a little wobbly.",5
8280,- Best 1080p monitor at this price range,"It worked well for a month and after it the display panel was showing cracks on the screen no outer damage
Asked for replacement or repair they ask for a cost more than the price
It is in warranty period",5
8281,Best gaming monitor under 10k.,"This monitor is Full HD 1080P resolution, comes with HDMI, VGA and DVI Ports. Picture clarity is good, thin bezel and well suitable for regular office applications. I am using for CCTV Monitoring as well as for my laptop as dual monitor. With menu button on two click i can switch between VGA and HDMI, no need to go with a long list of menu options and then select. This monitor also comes with Wall mounting option which is suitable for CCTV installers.",5
8282,Good resolution and sleek.,"So far it's great
Comes with HDMI cable no need to buy one !
Build is solid
Color reproduction is factory calibrated , better than other same price ranged products
And yes amd freesync works great ""make sure you turn
it on from settings"" 🙌 paired with Readon RX 570 no screen tearing!",5
8283,It's a good monitor,"- Good colors
- Easy installation
- Software provided gives additional features like split screen
- economic gaming monitor
- Free sync works ok
- Good design
- Only 5ms response time, seems to be a negative point, w.resp.to gaming.",4
8284,Don't think twice to buy it!!,"I've been using it for around 3 weeks and here's what I liked about it:
Picture quality: 9/10. I have to sit before my monitor for 8-9 hours a day because of my profession. I'm genuinely pleased with the clarity. Color accuracy is also quite good. LG IPS panels don't let down usually.
Anti-glare: Does a decent job. At least in indoor lighting conditions. I've tried keep the window opposite to my workstation open. It glares, as you'd expect. However, I can't ask for more from a monitor this cheap.
Not a gamer, can't say much about gaming.

Small features that I needed but you may not care about: thin bezels, presence of both HDMI and
VGA ports.

Overall, not the best monitor I've used. However, I received it for 7.8k INR. Which, given how good it is, is a steal. Can't ask more from a monitor this cheap.",5
8285,Bleeding at the Top and Right Edge.,"Its a nice nice panel at this cost. But the issue I saw was of light bleeding from corners but in well lit room its not that visible. Anyhow, the monitor is good and gives what it promises. The CD in the box was already cracked. Don't know how that can happen when there was not even a single dent on the packing box. Well, software are downloadable from internet an hence it was of no concern. I use the screen with ps4 and laptop and it looks awesome.",1
8286,Go for it. Budget Friendly.,"Picture quality with various modes are great for setting individual preferences. The custom mode this monitor comes with is too bright and is not recommended for long viewing hours.

Installation is a breeze , comes with HDMI cable. Register online @LG site for warranty.
Pre-calibrated , install the software that comes with the monitor for additional functions
Cons:
Lack of height adjustment",5
8287,Top Notch Display,"I am reviewing it after 1 month and so far I am blown away by the colors of this ips monitor...
And it did not have any light bleeding so thats a plus point.. it has 75hz but be aware that its only available when freesync is on and only in hdmi not in dvi or vga... And the freesync will not work on nvidia but 75hz works.. and This is also brightest monitor i have used so far.. thats also a good thing..",5
8288,itz really good. at first i connect it with my set ...,"Got it for 6752/- during the recent sale, very good monitor at this price. Vibrant colors, less bezel, Light weight compared to my previous DELL monitor which I used for 12 years. Only problem I had was the HDMI connector should have been angled so it doesn't touch the wall behind monitor.",5
8289,Good display with accurate color reproduction,"About picture quality is awesome ,it's is the FHD 1920*1080 pixels.
Screen
Colour reproduction is good pre calibrated and it's come with nice features like HDMI DVI Port and free since technology overall
Value for money in this pricing segment.",4
8290,The packaging was done carefully and the product came in good hands. Been almost 4 months since purchase and ...,"Writing this after just 4 hours of usage.
I was sick of VGA LED monitor. So I gave it a try after reading overwhelming rating of 4+ on amazon.
I use Linux mint OS and I was particularly hesitant whether this will be supported. Usually the FHD VGA monitors have issue with Linux Mint or Ubuntu OS.
But I was STUNNED by the CLARITY of this monitor and the FONTS ARE HAIR THIN clear and the COLORS are stunning. If you want a FHD IPS upgrade for your LINUX OS go ahead and give it a try.

Also, I bought it at price of 7.7K and it got delivered less than 24 Hours during Diwali so I am very satisfied.",5
8291,Worth the price,"Its a great monitor.

Pros:
- HD quality output. Sharp and crisp text and pictures on the screen
- Easy installation
- Screen's bezel is almost none which makes the monitor look cute

Cons:
- Can't adjust the height perhaps, but it can be tilted.",4
8292,100% Value for your hard earned money.,"I ordered it for development but now I am using it for multiple reasons.
1. It's full HD si it is good for development.
2. High resolution games graphics looks great.
3. Picture quality is awesome.
4. Using it as a TV too.
5. Supports HDMI so I can connect to my HD dish TV or to my Laptop/Computer.
6. It has built-in Audio out which helps a lot when I connect it as a tv.",5
8293,Monitor blacks out.,Worth the money! A very good Product! I bought this for Rs. 6299/- during the Amazon sale and it every bit worth it. Amazing picture clarity and good frame rate. I even connected my PS4 and Amazon FireStick qnd was amazed with the picture quality. Its built for gaming. Worth buying this Monitor! Also the packaging was good. Delivery was also on time.,1
8294,Just go for this i already watched so video and this is best,Great monitor speacially as i got it for 6k on the amazon sale. Worth the money. I usually use this as a seco d mo itor when working (typically has outlook open) or mostly use this for my ps4. Only con i see it it doest aito detect the input source between dvi and hdmi and i have to manually switch.,5
8295,Product is worth as per it's price. But some additional thing is missing from the box.,"Very good product. Didn buy it for gaming purpose, I predominately use it for just streaming movies and browsing, for which this product is absolutely worth it.
Have to say the freesync feature can't be switched on, I think it can be enabled only if you have a graphic card. Also I noticed there are some light bleeding issues along all the edges when I turn on the screen. But it is only visible when the screen is black, so it won't be affecting that much for a normal user. But in case if you work on black background a lot, then it might be disturbing. None of the above issues bothered me since I use it for only streaming movies, so I would say overall it's a very good product.",4
8296,screen flickers,"My only dislike about this monitor is the brightness. It is too bright, even when the brightness is set to 0. Apart from that, I had issues with this monitor when I was using linux. On windows, it worked perfectly.

I brought this for the 16:9 ratio. A part of my three monitor setup, I am very satisfied with this purchase.",3
8297,Quality product though a bit expensive,"My purpose - mainly coding, very little premier pro and moderate gaming - Dota 2, RON.
Requirements - Sharp text, accurate/true to life colours. Refresh rate not an issue to me.
It has a good LG software to use multi screen like features.
Easy settings joystick.
Colours are good.
NOTE - It's not edge to edge display as shown in the images. There is a SLIGHT border that gets hidden by the top anti glare layer. But it's not a deal breaker with very thin bezel.

No cons as such, it's just a 9k display. Did not experience bleeding issues or even if it's there, not that prominent to affect my work.
Picture quality is really good.
Anti glare layer helps a lot and possibly for gaming but I don't use much for gaming.",4
8298,Dont buy this model,"Colours are awesome, having HDMI port and Audio out port makes it a complete Tv type fills just add chromecast or HDMI set top Box and speakers to screen and you have Tv ready. Obviously add it with VGA port to CPU and your Computer is ready. Multiple use and very sleek and trendy.",1
8299,Awesome must go ..,It's such a big difference moving from 1440 x 900 to a 1920 x 1080 resolution monitor. Great clarity and worth the cost. I bought it for Rs7399 during festival season,5
8300,Do not but this for laptop users,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 1..Pixels dont perfectly display colors during DARK/GREY/SHADOW areas WHILE watching MOVIES and during playing GAMES
I.e. u are able to see Small Small pixel dots in those dark/grey/shadow areas which LOOKS VERY TERRIBLE..I regret buying this budget monitor .🤕

2..If u guys are buying this for PHOTO EDITING and normal OFFICE WORK then Its Good

3..But DON'T BUY it for watching MOVIES and playing GAMES bcz it Shows CLOUDING effect (YouTube it) as discuss in point 1 above..

4. IPS panel used here is cheapest one that's why it's for 8k to 9k ..I recommend Go for higher range of IPS panel for perfect picture quality..

5...If u can compromise picture quality for budget then buy it ..otherwise don't buy it .bcz it's not perfect budget monitor as u will expect..

6...I also replaced monitor but then to this issue (point 1 ) persist ....and this ISSUE PERSIST IN EVERY LG22MP68VQ monitor bcz the IPS PANEL is same in every unit of this model ...

7...FINAL VERDICT DON'T BUY ANY MONITOR FROM ONLINE AS U CAN'T GET TO KNOW ABOUT such CLOUDING issues ...BUY FORM LOCAL STORE AND DIFFERENT MODEL BUT NOT THIS ONE ..",1
8301,5 star for the picture quality..but 1 star of the body material,I bought this screen for office work. Easy to set up. But noticed a yellow tinge in parts of the the screen when background in white. Would not recommend to others,5
8302,Great peripheral for my 14' laptop,"Im already using this Monitor in my office so I don't want to check any review, this have very good picture quality and colour are pretty much accurate. No issues on viewing angles. This is actually not a LED monitor guys its LED backlight monitor so don't misunderstand you can check the difference in google . Best product under this price segment. It is 60hz so no for gamers . Im a photoshop user its very good for that kind of uses..",4
8303,The best in the range,"Best buy 22 inch screen.
got stucked b/w BenQ and LG. LG wins.
I bought this at 6200+799(SBI cashback)=6999-/ (amazon sale on Sept 28-31Oct)
best Quality under value of 6200. I wish i had bought bigger screen than this. though this one is amazing but always better to go for big. Buy if you are extending your screen over PC / Laptop
can also use for gaming. wait for few more months if you can. new models are coming with more new features.",5
8304,Excellent product for work and watching movies/videos.,"I have bought this 22MP68VQ IPS Monitor just only 6000 rupees on Amazon Great Indian Festival sale. Picture quality is Awesome^2 and overall performance is 👌👌If you want to buy a new monitor, I suggest you buy it blindly.",5

Unless you are sure of your table, chair and your height match with this monitor height, I am sure you will also break your neck.",5
8306,LG monitor is very good,"1. Not good for office work but okok.text matter is not sharp. As mentioned on the outer box, this is ideal for movies and entertainment and not for work.
2. Poor plastic quality and delicate stand. So, handle with care.
3. I got for Rs.7100 after Sri credit card and freedom sale.",5
8307,Poor quality lcd panel received,This monitor has excellent clarity and resolution. I would have not returned if the display had consistent colour spread. the unit I got has yelloish shade at 60% of the screen at right side,1
8308,Good Product but need improvement in the external parts,"A terrific purchase at the price point. The screen is good, robust and has great color accuracy. AMD freesync is useful for system having AMD video cards.
You can't go wrong woth the purchase. It's been 6 months the screen is as good as new. The thins bezels do look good and the display attracts everyone who sees it. Happy with the product.",4
8309,Fantastic panel with colours,"I used this monitor to extend my laptop display. It is perfect for extended display. Resolution is good. You can use hdmi cable to connect to the laptop. It still has vgi port along with 3.5mm output port for audio.
The box contained an hdmi cable. So no need to buy new. The box had one hdmi cable, stand for monitor and power plug.",4
8310,Good dispaly.,Great product. I neede a hdmi monitor for my new pi 4b. I loved the product . It has small joystick 🕹️ like switches for navigation. The only bad thing is it's packaging. Another thing is that there is no height adjustment with the stock stand. It is also slim,5
8311,Do not use the hdmi cable that comes free with the monitor,"Best in class monitor .Best for budget segment pc best picture quality gives a very very good refreh rate with my AMD processor and precision while gaming. only
con it does not come with inbulit speaker but thats a very little problem . rest every thing is best in this monitor. Go For It.",4
8312,Screen unexpectedly getting heated,"AMD graphics card is supported 1080p

Only turn on freesync is supported 1080p in Nvidia graphics,
Response time 5ms, total suck so anyone want to buy contact me 50% offer for you",4
8313,Very good purchase,"Picture is not crisp when I am connecting to Laptop.
Average product. Was expecting much better quality from LG.
Made in china monitor but from LG company. Wondering why cant they make it India.",4
8314,Don't think twice Go for it.,"The cable sent is HDMI. My PC has only D-Sub and DVI-D. The Owner's Manual CD would not open in PDF Reader.
There is no printed manual. Most of the other information is in Chinese (?). Therefore, I can't adjust resolution or glare. I need Amazon's help",5
8315,"Awesome for Gaming, Productivity","I was confused just like you whether to buy this or not but since I bought this and after 4 to 5 months of use I wanna say it that it's great. It's amazing. I couldnt have got any better monitor in this price. I uploaded a video but then it had some policy issues. But anyways, go for it. It's awesome. I am using it with my lenovo x230 laptop and it's working just butter❤️",5
8316,Received a broken monitor,"I bought this mainly for codingand light gaming purpose and for a budget gamer it is nice far from perfect but yes the picture quality is good and the size of the monitor is decent enough that small objects can be seen from a decent distance from the computer.
The are two things that take away one star is
1. While playing fast pace games like cod or cs go it stutters a bit
2. The audio output port is a bit loose it might be only in my monitor
All in all its the best monitor u can have under 10k. For its price it gives you the best features . Go for it .",1
8317,Worest service,"Good monitor under budget, I replaced the first monitor because the panel has warm tint on half right side it's kind of yellowish shade and then I received a replacement it's lot better then previous one,But I think this monitor panels have this tint issue🤔 as you can see in the pictures
For gaming:-
I'm using this monitor with Nvidia 1050ti at 75hz refresh rate it good👍
For general use:-
Excellent 👌",1
8318,Worst pdoduct and very bad service from LG,"Product was delivered 4 days before ETA by Amazon, thumbs up to Amazon for the delivery in a healthy condition. The package had the monitor, a stand, a hdmi cable, a power cable, cd, warranty and guidlines documents along with it. Installation was super easy. Recomended resolution for Windows 10 is 1980*1080 which makes the picture look real. The design is borderless and literally feels like looking through a window. It is the best monitor I have ever used and its no doubt a value for money product. I would recommend this product for those who are interested.",1
8319,Awesome product. Value for money,"UPDATED REVIEW:
I have been using this monitor for almost 3 years and now it has a red horizontal line on the display. Although the line is very thin and unobtrusive, it is easy to see to the naked eye on a grey background. The red line indicates that the panel / display is about to die.

Fortunately, LG offers 3 year warranty for this product and this issue popped up 10 days before the end of the warranty period (Thank God!). After a quick chat with the LG customer care, they had sent a technician to my house and within 3-4 days, they replaced the display of this monitor. Don't know if the display will die soon but I did get a full replacement like they promised and I am happy about it.

Nevertheless, I expected a LG monitor to work flawlessly for at least 5 years. Hope the new display does not die soon as I really love this monitor. For now, it is as good as new.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OLD REVIEW: Absolutely Gorgeous! One of the best deals out there. Paid Rs 80 extra for 2 day delivery, but the Packaging was mind blowing. The brightness sometimes feels high, but easily adjustable. Picture quality is amazing. Could've added more Tilt, I guess. It's a perfect monitor for gaming and content creation.",5
8320,"Defected HDMI cable, please don't buy this product accessories are not genuine",This is the worst monitor to go for. The screen cracked from inside just by a touch. I handle my stuff very carefully and still this monitor cracked i cant even understand how. The LG repair person says the cost of repair is 8000 + where as i bought this product for 7000. This is useless monitor. Go for some other monitor which has good durability and also a good advise would be go for something where the edge of the screen is a little covered with protection. This monitor edge is actually the screen edge and this will crack by simple touch. This is made of cheap material.,3
8321,nice product,"If you already have a great Primary monitor and you want to supplement it with another one go with this as this is great for the price you pay. Usually you don't need more than 60Hz Second monitor while the primary one being a min of 120Hz.
Picture Quality - 4
Anti Glare - 5
Video Editing Experience - 5",5
8322,The Best Budget Monitor,"After 6 months of usage i can say worst product i ever purchased.
In 6 months the picture panel is gone. I had dell before lasted for 8 years. How i am keeping this one from cleaning to cover up , using good wire. I didn't even do 10% with Dell. But in 6 months??",5
8323,75hz also works with Nvidia Gpu (Im having 750ti),I would just say one thing that this monitor can beat every monitors out there in the market. Even it's better than Benq. After switch on my computer I just speechless by seeing the screen quality and color reproduction. This monitor definitely change your computing system. If you afford some penny please go with monitor without any hesitation.,5
8324,Just awesome .,Superb display.You can notice the difference between a laptop screen and this LG monitor.Such a good clarity and detail is found only on Led Tv .,5
8325,Value for money.,If you are going to watch movies on it ..dont buy as picture quality is not that good as screen lags while watching fast moving action scenes on it...and the lg service guys said it is not made for that..,5
8326,All well with this monitor. But no DVI/DP cable,"The monitor is just awesome in this price range. Something which is eye catching is the picture quality, though the screen is 1080p but the picture quality is not much clear. There is no speaker provided with the monitor and the build quality is average but that thing doesn't matters because this is the best monitor one can get in this budget. Beside these cons the monitor is fabulous with bright ips led panel, light weight and have easy installation procedures.",4
8327,Awesome,"after many evaluation i bought this monitor but received defective product with a large shadow on screen right side of the display

Update : Product Replaced with Newone and the Problem is heavy backlite even I kept brightness to 0",5
8328,Good one but returned due to backlight bleed issue. May buy in next sale,"Perfect product
Contrast is proper
Blacks looks fantastic
Color reproduction is awesome

75Hz works even on Nvidia cards:
Switch on freesync
Open Nvidia control panel >Custom resolutions > create 1920*1080 @75Hz. Set Refresh rate to 74Hz in Nvidia custom resolution if anyone is facing microstutters.",3
8329,Bang Monitor!,"Very good monitor, parking was ok. The only confusing part is that, in description it is mentioned as LED and on box LCD. I was confused with that. When chacked with customer care they said it is LCD monitor with LED backlight. Good part is, the monitor coming with HDMI cable and no need to buy seperate one",4
8330,Contrast is excellent.,"this is a super product. i am using for few days and could not ask for more, it makes work from home to easy. you will get a HDMI cable and power cable with it. picture quality is super and viewing angles are good, go for it without any second thought",5
8331,Value for money,"So I'm using theis monitor for 2 days.. the good thing is that it's very slim and it has wall mount. I would prefer you guys to go for wall mount as the monitor stan is not very good it shakes too much even the slightest vibration in the desk makes it shake so if you don't like shakey monitor while gaming i would suggest use a wall mount. Overall it's best in this price range comes with AMD FREESYNC, if you have AMD gpu go for it. Nvidia users sadly this is not for you guys.. :)",4
8332,Utterly disappointed,watch out the difference !! nice computing and movie viewing experience. I m not an expert but this is pretty decent monitor in this price range. I thoroughly did research for 5-6 days before buying this one and satisfied with it. For long term review will uodate my review after 3 months.,1
8333,Defective product received. Avoid the seller if you need this product urgently.,Fantastic TV. But remember that there is NO BUILT IN AUDIO. Luckily I have a wireless headset and I mainly use it as a dual monitor setup or play console games on it.,1
8334,Crisp image,"I'm writing this after 1 year of usage. Bought this monitor for 6999 in lightning deal.
1. Display quality is good compared to other
2. It's good for gaming with 75Hz refresh rate
3. It's got very minimal bezels
4. I didn't like the stand much

At this price point it can't get any better.",5
8335,Best Monitor at this Price Range,When comes to picture quality it provide accurate colours in movie and videos and also games and with the bazel less display that makes it best looking monitor in 10k..it comes with hdmi cable that is another advantage because you dont have to purchase separately and that will help lot for tose who have graphics cards...bt i give it 4 star becoz the left side of the display give whitten bt right side is little bit yellowish bocz it have reading mode with split screen bt if you not notice it detailed then it cant be a problem otherwise it is ok for me,5
8336,3rd class product and customer service approach,"This is the bottom line. If you want a monitor that is best bang for the buck, this is the product to buy. I bought two and have them set up on a dual arm VESA mount.

Best features:

IPS Panel 60Hz with LED back light
6 different color modes (some better for darker environment, for reading, for movies, for coding)
VESA mount (a must have for dual monitor setup)
A fairly thin bezel on three sides",1
8337,Satisfactory,"Useful for coding, enough large second screen.
Good quality as for movie/TV Series watching experience.
HDMI cable came with the box.
-----
No in-built speakers. AUX port for external speaker connect.
Fixed height stand.
Made in China.",4
8338,Received defective item again,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Easy to install.. 75hz 1920x1080 resolution.. looks good , very light weight.. has a app called On Screen Control which we can use to adjust settings without button so that's great .. DOESN'T HAVE NVIDIA SYNC!!",1
8339,Good Monitor in midsegement,"I liked this product and enjoy doing primary work on it. Only thing got it at 9k, but wish I had save a 1k during sale during prime days. Also I thought the screen can't be adjusted or tilted, but u can do it just by holding the screen top and bottom and incline the angels accordingly.",5
8340,Worth buying,I've been using it for the last 8 months Comparing monitor sold at a higher price is not in any way a match with it. It is very good in quality and its performance during use. Those who buy at Budget price can buy freely without any doubt. It's really LIFE'S GOOD,5
8341,Worst Stand to Assemble and Disassemble,Below average monitor. Disappointed to see the performance of this monitor.within few days after purchase started to see shadows of text so ordered replacement but the new one also showing same issue after a week of use.,1
8342,Screen size small overall good product,"The overall outer looks and packaging was impressive. I ordered it seeing so many good reviews about it. But in practical, I was disappointed with it's flickering and too much backlight bleeding and washed out colors. I tried a lot with the calibration but not got good results. So returned it.",4
8343,Great device,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
 Pros
1) Thin bezels.
2) No backlight issues.
3) Good packaging and timely delivery.

Cons
1) Shaky stand. The screen vibrates even on the slightest of movement on the desk.
2) Screen is a little forward tilted and hence does not provide a good viewing angle. This won't be an issue for wall mounting.",5
8344,"Good Product... Don't think, Go fo this only","You will not regret buying this monitor, It has a 75Hz refresh rate and 5ms response time which provides an immersive experience. If you are thinking that 22 ich is not big, trust me it is very big cinema screen which provides you ultimate experience. If you are a very hardcore gamer, who does very competitive gaming then go for Samsung 144 Hz VA panel monitor which has 1ms response time. If you are a beginner in PC building or wants monitor for dual screen setup or some other reason, this is for you. It's worth your money.",5
8345,Over all looks good I can recommend it work good,"The display quality is good, even though i hate matte screens, i could get used to this one.

only cons:
1. It would be good if it had two hdmi ports.
2.I had some minor artifacts show up in 900p resolution, you can turn on gpu scaling in your computer to resolve it but at the cost of added input lag and some performance drop which isnt favourable for esports title like csgo and valorant which many of us play at lower resolutions for extra frames.",5
8346,Good one,"The antiglare is perfect. One problem with the overall design is the base. It could have been a little heavier. As a result of the light weight the monitor wobbles a lot. Picture quality is super awesome.

Worst customer service by LG. Downgrading the rating. They do not even acknowledge the design issue with the stand.",5
8347,Screen Issue within 3 month,"Just amazing, perfect colors and details the blacks r so good. Ips panel does the job well. Came with sealed box perfectly delivered with care no damage anything from appario seller. Display is perfect for gaming it has 75hz refresh Rate also with screen tearing it play the games butter smooth. Colors r so perfect not over saturated.

Worth for the game, video editing also. Bang for buck close ur eyes and go for it. Best led monitor under 10k. With amd sync, 75hz refresh rate full HD screen anti glare. So just buy it without any second thought",1
8348,Purchased at sell at 6000 rs,"I previously had same model monitor purchased in 2018. Back then the picture quality was much better, the previous monitor got some serious green lines at so had to purchase new one. But this new make does not even make up for clarity of previous make. It has some serious ghosting issue and even screen is bit on dull side and yellowish. Check the photo... the one on right is 2018 monitor vs 2020 new monitor on left",5
8349,Dark Dead pixels😑👎,"Amazing monitor. I am using it for my PS4. Had to replace once due to green lines appearing in the 1st piece but 2nd is totally good. It's a budget monitor, I bought it for 8k in sale. It has an AUX cable which is helpful for ps4. And picture quality is good and crystal clear.",2
8350,Excellent product ever seen!!,Picture quality is better but there is slight sharpening effect comes in when anything moving on the screen you will notice if u see carefully overall is good product at this price it might hurt your eyes if you are not used to bright screens. if u seat closer to monitor its better to keep brightness low. I prefer slightly bigger screen display than just 22 inch may be 24 inch will be really good. If anyone is on budget then this is the better monitor that's why i chose this one.,5
8351,Perfect product. Completely satisfied.,"Monitor audio is not working. I checked it late, first i thought it was some settings issue but later found out that this is a hardware issue. LG service took one month to process all this and said they won't replace it, only repair it. Sending a faulty product and not replacing it, is the worst service.

I would never recommend buying such company products who has this kind of service.

Please throughly check all the features on the first day it self.",5
8352,Great display quality,"It's a great monitor but the build quality doesn't seem to be up to the expectations. I sparingly used this monitor. Maybe 1-2 hours on weekends and in a year the panel had lines all over and started leaking fluid. LG service was very good to fix it in just a few days. But 6 months later I have the exact same issue again. It's still in warranty so I will change my review again if LG fixes it and it lasts me at least a ""few"" years",5
8353,For me its worth it Satisfied!!! 2020 customer,"I brought this as an extended monitor for my WFH. I ended up using this as my primary monitor than the existing DELL. This is incredibly slim and very good picture quality. No eyestrain. Easy to install and very good selection of ports. So far no ""Cons"" in my view.",4
8354,GO FOR IT,"Pro: video quality, style and anti glare.
Cons: Text looks jagged/pixelated. So not good for coding or text only work. I've connected it macbook pro using HDMI cable but was not able to use it.",4
8355,Not a quality product,"Pros :
Nice display
Hdmi support
good size to put it in table
natural colurs
Good refresh rate

Cons :
No Wall mount support
Only one HDMI
No external speakers",3
8356,One of the best monitor under 10000,"Just 1week over using this monitor screen adjustment automatically according to light available in the room which is nice feature.
Didn't find any problem so far will see for another 2-3months for deep review.",5
8357,Best screen in this price range.,"A beautiful monitor with really good color reproduction. Enable freesync and the picture colors become even more vibrant, you unlock 75hz as well. I used a gtx 1660 super with this monitor and it works flawlessly. Even with the hdmi cable, freesync is achievable (at least in my case). Go for this if you want a budget monitor with really good value for money. 75hz i know is not a great improvement over 60, but even a slight increase above 60 is noticeable.",5
8358,Good product,"EVERYTHING IS ALRIGHT FOR THIS PRICE (LG)
but this is not all borderless as they mentioned there is an extra black out around the bordeR.(This is not gooD)
the display quality is good with IPS but there is an grey out on the screen, not pure black.",5
8359,Good picture quality,"HDMI or VGA Cable not found with a monitor box. The second is that the monitor automatically changes the resolution. Sometimes it takes 800-600, sometimes it takes 1024-768. After one hour or two, the monitor switch is off automatically. Most of the time, even after contacting the service centers, one person (Mr.Jadhav-Virar) came and saw the monitor, only after four days. And I told me “I will talk to my seniors”. After that, they do not reply even after calling.",5
8360,Worth Buying,"Excellent purchase on this segment.

Pros:
22"" screen more than sufficient.
Split screen working flawless with ""LG Onscreen Control"" software.
Tilt, yes possible to the extent, that benefits your need.
No lag.

Cons:
No Height adjustment
No Inbuilt speaker (Not needed though)

Good choice if you are looking for a moderate office usage.",5
8361,Great picture quality and the crispness of the image,"This is an entry level economical monitor. Picture quality is good, colour is also good. However on some application dialog box I get slightly blurry text. That's strange, probably an OS problem, I am not sure.",5
8362,"22"" Budget Pick for WFH","It took me 3-4 days of continous calibration using Nvidia , the montior settings and some 3rd party software to achieve the display as my S10+ amoled display ( though not the blacks). The display is not very sharp. I am lucky that I didnt bought a bigger one. 75hz works fine and i have calibrated the display on it. I am attaching pics. NEVER GO TN FOR HIGHER REFRESH RATE.

Display is crisp and colors are punchy, blacks are great and there are multiple modes for us to customize depending on our work. I loved it and delivers a overall good performance. Those thin bezels makes our movie time even crisp greater. I got it for 7899 during big billion days. Definitely a worth buying and I'm experiencing it. Go for it blindly.",5
8365,Quality product at affordable price,"Beware !!!! This product is not wall-mountable. The product description clearly says the product is wall-mountable, but it is not. So if you are looking for a wall-mountable monitor... do not buy this product",5
8366,Very bad Product,"I bought this as a home monitor to connect to my laptop. Was quite disappointed with the build . Very flimsy. More importantly this is not height adjustable( very low on the stand length) and this adds lot of strain to your shoulders, basically defecating the purpose of a monitor. and this does not have a back lit option to work in the night.",1
8367,Steal deal @6300 rupees.,"I got this LG product 2 days back monitor on the right side is not working replacement was ordered i thought issue will be solved, surprisingly today the amazon delivery guy came to take defect product cancelled my replacement order as monitor not showing right side.

8372,Overall good for my daily work and games. But box damaged.,"The picture quality is excellent with crisp colours. I had bought this monitor because of the headphone jack present in it.

8378,Nice buy for WFH,"Totally bad product, I still have no idea how this product got 4.5-star ratings. The display is too bright.

8379,Best for price,"Best monitor under 10k. Got it for 6999 on great Indian festival. 22inch is a huge one considering Iam ugegared from 15 inch to 22.colour quality and brightness are great. For gaming it's the best ips panel under 10 k. Don't go for 24 inch gaming monitors for extra 3k just to get 2 inch extra. There is some minor bleeding is here, but as for the price it's a great value monitor. Even some high end monitors suffers bleeding issues.",5
8380,"Very fragile, the build quality is very poor.","Value for money. Very good product. It's been more than a month now, serving it's purpose well.

I used this for coding and programming purpose where before in laptop screen I used to feel stress on my eyes so I extended my screen and it is really good if you want to use long hour ( reader mode).

But once set no worries. The power button should have been a stand alone button and not interconnrcted with the menu settings joystick. The arc stand is quite sturdy, monitor stays steady.

8443,Best Budget Gaming Monitor !!,"This is the best quality monitor available in the market under Rs. 10,000 till date. I've been using it for 1 month and the performance is very satisfactory till date.",5
8444,Worth the price and time,First thanks to Amazon for fast delivery of the product and the LG monitor is very good at this price point because it has 75hz refresh rate that is good for gaming and it also has LG on screen software which is to control the brightness for individual applications and the last thing that it is a IPS display which provides 179. 0 degree wide angle.,4
8445,worth the price,Pathetic panel viewing angle are too bad when dark scene display totally reflect picture quality is too bad believe me or not why to this is happen to my moniter.... The only reason for buying this monitor seen on YouTube lot of people recamened.... Poor decisions.... Bad too bad,4
8446,honest review,Picture quality is good. Also on screen control is really amazing. At the same time height is not adjustable and also base stand is not properly balancing sometimes Monitor is not grip with this stand,3
8447,Overall Good Quality but Blacks are not that good,"It is a great panel with fantastic colour reproduction, good stand and look with thin bezels, but price should be around 8k, it is worth paying 1k more than cheaper moniyors.",4
8448,Best budget monitor for 1080p gaming.,"Good display, probably best under 10k in IPS category.

Pros
-----
Lots of settings in the menu.
Goes up to 75Hz, which is a noticeable improvement over the usual 60Hz.
Bezels are very thin.

Cons
-------
Viewing angles are not that great.
Blacks are not that deep (True for any IPS panel)",5
8449,"Fabulous , Overpowered",The reason i am giving it 4 stars is that the hdmi cable the comes free with the monitor does not support HDCP whereas the monitor itself supports it. That means Amazon Prime/Netflix wont play videos in HD format. After replacing the hdmi cable with one from Amazon Basics i was able to get HD video.,5
8450,Excellent colour reproduction,"Was not expecting HDMi cable but good that I recieved it.
Picture quality seems to be good so far.
Cons I noticed till now,
-you might feel screen is tilting to front side slightly.
-Also screen is getting heated and that is something you won't want when monitor is too close to you.",5
8451,Vertical lines..annoying.,Overall a very good purchase in ips led monitor picture quality is very sharp and clear refre5 rate is good but a little cons is that there is a light bulry glowing in the top of the led i don't find the reason of this i have use vga cable but this is hdmi best support so don't know but good quality in this price...,2
8452,Best Full HD borderless IPS panel in this price range.,There is nothing to dislike about. It was an amazing product. Guys one more thing I bought this product for 8500Rs so please wait for till the sale time.

Good IPS display and also good viewing angles. It also has Amd free sync.,5
8453,Go for it,"If you want a budget gaming monitor, it's for you. It has 75hz display which is great at this price point. The picture quality is awesome. You can do both Gaming and Productivity tasks like Photoshop or watch movies with this monitor. I got it for around Rs.7200 from sale. If you're buying this monitor, wait for Amazon sale. You'll get a great deal.",5
8454,Best for Gaming amd watching videos,"I didn't get the chance to rate the product feature because I received a broken monitor, raised a complaint to replace it, but still no one came to pick the broken monitor, waiting for more than 10 days, very disappointed with no action taking place :(",5
8455,Good with HDMI cable only,Everything thing was good but after some days while running it started burning and with in 2dys display was gone black and stopped working. Lg has best customer care service with fraud technications they didnt even care or didnt even respond.,5
8456,Just perfect for Regular use,Worst product i have ever used. My monitor damaged within 10 months and there is no proper service or response from LG even after 10 days I have complained. So many lines are appearing on the screen with many colors and display will be blinging always. I am a designer and getting too much difficulties with my work. Don't by this product.,5
8457,Budget Beast!!!,Very good quality monitor.. value for money. Go for it.,4

8461,Awesome And worth the price,There's some bleeding on top bezel sides but thats only 5 percent. You cant even notice that without noticing closely best monitor for watching movies 75hz also works with nvidia gpu cards.

8462,Best in this price range,"Very sharp display.
Earlier i used to esit on my laptop's TN panel and after i used this monitor there is just no going back.

Build material is not good since for the price you have to settle at a margin :P
Needs better cable management",5

Nice bass

9154,Super,Super product.sound quality is soo good. I never expected this in this price. Worth for money I was using this since 2 months.after that I was writing this review.,5
9155,Super Quality,Its output power (65watt)was very powerful. Its sound quality was so standard. Its woofer sound will make you to feel the music in better way. ☺ Nice quality i had bought this item 2 years ago since no complaints happened in this product. Thank you amazon&zeebronics. ☺,5
9156,That's Royals,Gifted to my Sis. I’m glad that she liked it & impressed with the Sound & Bass. At this price this is one of the great sound system. For those who are commenting that Sound & Bass is not good well you won’t be getting a Bose 5.1 at ₹3-4K. You’ll need to spend 3-4Lakhs for that. So don’t expect Dolby Atmos sound at this range. And for the people looking for an sound system at budget then definitely this is for you.,5
9157,It is just mind blowing sound system,"Purchased in Aug, 2016, writing this review in Nov, 2020.
I've been using this for more than 4 years and you can not get better speakers at this price.",5
9158,Nice products,"This is a beautiful looking speaker set with great bass. But sadly the remote is faulty. Its continuously activated without any buttons being pressed as you can see in foto but worse my return or replace time has expired so not sure what I can do about that The surround speakers are not that great. My f&d speakers are better. But over all its v nice. I ordered on 17/10, got it on 24.",5
9159,Good product for value,I am writing the review after 3years of use . Its value for money and bluetooth connectivity is really really good n it's still working fine like it worked on the day one.,5

I got it for the price of INR 2799 and for this price it is really a value for money product.

9199,Hiii,"Alright. So, I ordered this speaker mainly because of its Bluetooth connectivity as my old Sony 4.1 lacks that particular feature and if I want to listen to some music from my phone in that speaker, I would have to physically connect it and then changing the songs when needed is a hassle. So, I was looking for a speaker at comparatively lower price that wouldn't compromise the sound quality. I usually buy speakers after at least listening to its sound in a shop, but this time I gave it a chance and trusted those many reviewers who said this is the best budget speaker with good enough sound quality and good enough bass. Well, I was kind of taken aback after seeing the actual woofer size. It was smaller than I expected and physical size does matter when it comes to bass and hence the bass is not solid enough. Now, don't misinterpret. It's a pretty thumpy bass and it doesn't cracks, but still it somehow lacks the solidity that I have heard in some other speakers. Clarity is really good, both over Aux and bluetooth. When it comes to the total loudness, it's not very loud really. Good enough for a medium sized room, but even with full volume at the speaker level and on the device, it won't blow your roof away...far from it. On the positive side, even at maximum volume the sound doesn't degrade and retains its quality. With bluetooth the sound loudness is at 90% that of what you get with Aux. The bass also goes down a bit with bluetooth. The bluetooth connectivity is awesome, instant, quality is good and doesn't have any noticeable delay(which I was worried about). As a result, I decided to use this speaker with my TV(over bluetooth) and I would keep my Sony for listening to music. By the way, the best part is the remote, it has many functions and the most usable are your ability to control sound level at each and every speaker and the woofer.

Edit : I want to add few points regarding the remote control. I found it bit hard to set up the FM channels. At first I didn't find the auto scan channel option. There is a scan button, but on pressing it, nothing happened(Later I found out from the manual you have to press it for 2-3 seconds to get it working). So, I had to manually tune and find each channel by using tune+ - buttons. And then it was really tricky to save those channels once you find it. On pressing the Save button, it always tries to save them under Channel 01, and changing the name is a bit tricky, I am sure you will figure it out. The good thing is, you can directly type in any channel frequency number from the numeric keypad on the remote. So, in FM mode if you type 938, it will take you to 93.8 FM channel. That's good. The only downside to this remote control is, it has no mute option. In the manual it says, the REPEAT button will function as Mute, but it doesn't work.",5
9200,Nice,Such a nice product. Using it for more than 2 years. Bluetooth connectivity looks fine as well as the sound quality.,5
9201,Good,Nice home theter product,5
9202,Good,Working as expected,5
9203,R,"The sound is very clear. The bass control is not available in your remote, you have to adjust it from your playback device. This home theater will be perfect for a 15'x18' room. If you are hosting a house party this gadget will defenitely increase your reputation. Better than expensive portable sound speakers. If portability is not a primary requirement, go for it.",5

9407,"Sound like irritation, with NO EQ in BT mode FAKE BLUETOOTH VERSION","I used the product to support the audio for my second home TV and the sound quality is average. It is not bad for the price but if I have to be nit picky, then the bass is way too heavy when compared to the treble on the system. Sometimes, the bass is so heavy that it overtones the dialogues when you are watching a movie or a show and if you try to balance it out, then the audio quality deceases drastically.",4
9408,Bahut accha product.kharid ne ke baad pata chalega,Sound quality is good and the bass is perfect for small room,5

1.Surround Sound
2. Competitive Price
3. Bluetooth Connectivity
4. Can connect with Dish/Tv easily (cable available)
5. Can increase volume of EACH speaker separately.
6. Quality Sound.

Cons:
1.Only good for a small room. I put it in hall and can't even hear sound in the next room. But nice surround experience though.
2. I bought it in an offer. If I would have paid a greater money, I would have found it just average.
3. Every speaker doesn't emit the same amount of sound, don't know why though.",5

Loud enough, speaker and central system design and quality is good. Only drawback is its poor sub woofer performance. Rest every feature is good enough to compete with any other leading brands. I am using it with philips DVD player for the last 1.5 years. For home, small room it can provide decent sound but never expect a deep bass from this model.",5

9528,Super,"Sound quality:
I replaced the product two times for same reason, the sub woofer was makin a low frequency noise or cracking kind of jarring sound. After replacing for the 2nd time, the problem was same.
Infact the person who came to replace, he also mentioned that due to the same problem the other customers are also replacing the item.

Remote control:
As far as good for home purpose usage.

Bluetooth connectivity:
Another blunder here. Within 1.5 mtrs range the Bluetooth starts breaking the sound.
The Bluetooth gets disconnected and The sound starts breaking unless you're sitting very very close to the speaker, which is not possible all the time to keep your mobile phone near speaker. Then why Bluetooth!

Zebronic, please Make quality product. Being a musician it's very bad experience for me with Zebronic sound system. Though the price is lesser than other speakers, but the quality is also cheaper. Didn't expect this much dissatisfaction I'll experience with the quality.
Thank you for keeping a replacement option along with refund option.",5
