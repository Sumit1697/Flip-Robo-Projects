0,Slightly disappointed,Not good.... Just average,3
1,Not Good in Connectivity,"Poor Bluetooth Connectivity. (may be bcz V 4.2)
Need Firmware Update immediately.",3
2,Not good,Call alert is very slow and bluetooth connectivity is very poor,3
3,Bad quality,Heart beat sensor are not working,3
4,Slightly disappointed,Not that much effective,3
5,Expected a better product,"Failed to give call alert frequently, the boat pro app needs to be visited again and again then it gives call alert otherwise the call alerts are not coming to the watch not as expected in quality",3
6,Moderate,"A basic watch to count your steps. The other measurements are not so accurate. Built quality is ok you have to get a screen guard and still be careful. Battery backup is good have spent 9 days already with morning walks, sleep monitoring, automatic heart rate, 5-6 SpO2 3-4 BP checks with minimal screen time and I still have 22 % battery left. Only 4 watch faces that too are not that attractive. More watch faces were promised via OTA update but not received yet. The price is very attractive and features are on par with price. There is no silent call only reject call. Because of BT 4.2 range is limited if you compare to BT 5. Font used is very basic so notifications are just functional. More work needs to be done on Boat Pro gear app which has a couple of years to catch-up with other watch apps. Boat is new into software so far they have only worked on hardware products. So in all if you are price sensitive and want a smart watch that works this could be your choice.",3
7,Bad quality,Don't expect more: Display was not good... connectivity time is more...Mi band 5 is far better.,3
8,Moderate,Bluetooth connectivity problem,3
9,Moderate,Call alert and call receiving miss,3
10,Moderate,Nice product,3
11,Expected a better product,Screen on time is slow and notifications are not coming on boAt watch while i sended to my other phone and calls are not showing in boAt watch. I cheaked all settings properly but not working. 😠,3
12,Expected a better product,"It's ok, dial is average....",3
13,Does the job,"Been using this Watch since it's launch. 30th Oct 2020. The product seems good initially, but fails to impress after long time use.

Pros:
1. The watch is lightweight & has slightly premium look.
2. The battery life is good, It lasts more than a week if you don't record any activity & a week if any activities are recorded. (Auto heart rate monitor on & with wake up gesture on)
3. The apps gives good amount of the info about the daily exercise, sleep, and heart rate.
4. The OS is simple.

Cons:
1. Tracking activities is slightly inaccurate. Sometimes the inaccuracy is exponentially way off.
2. The screen flashes before lighting up. And there is solid 1 & half second delay.
3. boAt claimed that they will add watch faces, 3+ months has passed and they haven't added any single watch face, instead they removed 1 watch face. In their Pre-launch advertise, they claimed 100+ watch faces will be added, but now they advertise upto 20.
4. I have had issues upgrading my watch and contacted their support. Even after 2 weeks they haven't updated me yet.
5. The UI isn't fluid.
6.Connecting to phone can be hesitating sometimes.
7. The only accurate sensor is heart rate monitor. Blood Oxygen Monitor, Blood pressure monitor doesn't give accurate readings and they are way off the limits.
8. Notifications are good feature but it doesn't show full notification if the text is too long.

Final thoughts: Given the price, and all the cons, it's an ""okay"" device for the people whom are new to smart watches. If you exercise daily, it can be use to get overview of your activity, with slight inaccuracy.",3
14,Good,"Don't expect surprises, it's best for the price only. Screen size is too small, strap quality is average, UI is not so smooth, battery capacity need to check on the go. What I didn't like most will be the screen - both quality as well as size. I bought this cos ot has BP, spo2 and heart rate monitors.",3
15,Nice,"Hi all...this is my first review in flipkart and basically I don't what to do the same..but now I am disclosing my views is that how really the watch works.

Cons:

The below views are after the updation of the app to the latest version.
1. Poor response for the notifications even we set 1 sec delay for notifications in the app
2. The heart rate monitor and blood pressure monitor is not that much accurate we can't do anything from the values displayed. So this features are almost unnecessary since it's purpose is not meet out.
3. Whatsapp notifications are not coming even we select the whatsapp tab in the app
4. Watch face from mobile album is not at all working even for cloud based watch face.
5. You advertised full screen touch but almost 20 percent of screen is not usable.

Pros:

1. Aesthetically very good and looks like a smart watch
2. Touch is smooth
3. Wrap material also seems good for this price range
4. No heating issues
5. Delivered 3 days before the committed date",3
16,Decent product,"Pros - very gud looking, stylish, screen touch also fine & smooth working, battery backup also very well going, strap quality best , sensors works good.

Cons - vibration quality not upto the mark as i felt as compared to mi band (i used). , heart rate measurement fluctuating always & the fluctuation digits reading for 2-3 times is not nearby accurate reading. And the main issue i checked, it looses the connection from the app boat progear automatically anytime , you have to checkin into the watch always that - is it connected or not

Development team has to take a look into app, why this connection issue happens",3
17,Does the job,"In terms of looks it is pretty neat in this price range and features as well for different modes like walk, Run, Yoga etc.
The app interface is straight to point.
I primarily use it for calories counter and sleep tracker.
It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Overall its a good device in this price. At least better than Noise.",3
18,Does the job,"Some of functions needs to be upgraded, hoat pro gear app is the only way to operate the functions. It does not support google Wear OS app. Most important, the available dail looks are just ordinary not so cool. Watching time function is not user friendly. Touch is good but dial looks small. Bluetooth range is also a constraint. Can be much better",3
19,Just okay,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
20,Decent product,Worth the price and blue color looks way better than black... Its an affordable good quality smartwatch.,3
21,Nice,The features are not that much godd if you compare with amaze fit or noise pro 3 but at this price segment it is perfect i bought it at 1999 rs in sale and i personally think it is the cheapest smart watch with the features like spo2. So it is value for money.,3
22,Fair,All is very good but Bluetooth is not perfect work on within 5 meter Renge ...is not good company given 10 meter... So not happy but ok,3
23,Just okay,"As design wise gd not so much ..battery backup also ok but the accuracy of spo2 and bp its not gd ..some times spo2 91 and after refreshing its 99 so I dont like this watch ,its just like a digital watch ..and some entertaining things in in it ..thats it ..I think u understand what I am saying",3
24,Just okay,"Not Satisfied as much as expected..
screen was too small in real
Incoming Call notification viewed so late by the time.. was not described at any video or details page..
Otherwise a good product in other things like sports activities..
Not worth to buying this..",3
25,Good,the product is good in term of features and look but the quality of the product not much good also the screen is not good,3
26,Good,"Display size is good. But except walking steps all other readings like BP, Heart beat etc are not at all accurate. All the time, it shows the same values...Just 2 unit differences only it shows...I have Honor 5 smart watch, it's almost accurate and touch panel also was good. Not very happy with the purchase....Hope, Boat would correct by updating its app and make me happy",3
27,Decent product,"Display is Ok (not so good or not so bad)
Build quality good.. it looks premium specially the side button.
The UI is so bad and laggy.
The sensors are somewhat correct but not exact.
The main problem of this watch is connection to phone.. it disconnect in every morning i don't know why and then it's a tough task to connect again to phone..",3
28,Fair,good but only 20 watchfaces,3
29,Just okay,"Really very Nice product...

30,Just okay,"Pro's

The design and the overall look is good.",3
42,Fair,Superb watch looking wise ...but activity tracker is very bad ...not accuracy.... Nothing very disappointed😔,3
43,Does the job,One thing I realised...Smart watch is just a marketing sell... actually we no need that...if u don't want to charge it every week then go for normal good looking analogue watches for this price.. otherwise This product look like premium.,3

56,Does the job,Call and other options not working. It's a normal watch,3
57,Decent product,Sensors are not functioning properly. It gives inactivity alert while I'm walking. Mi Band will be a better choice.,3
58,Does the job,"Actually when I read the reviews I was very impressed by frankly not as xpected yea the price s low bt still with less Features it could have been better spo2 tracker s not at all accurate the biggest problem s gets disconnected often and cannot receive even message alerts,also the display s very small not many watch faces although u can change the wall paper but frankly I m disappointed giving 3 stars only coz of low price",3
59,Does the job,"Pros:
1) SP02 monitor
2) Blood pressure monitor
3) heart rate monitor
4) Sleep tracker

Cons
Heart rate, blood pressure monitor not synchronised with app .

Social media notification like whatsapp is useless you cant read even single line of message not even nma of sender


Overall price is little high, android app user interface is very very poor,no heart rate blood oxygen and blood pressure synchronised to app time by time only walking steps and sleep tracker is synchronised

Watch skins are very poor and useless i cant imagine watch skin from boat .",3
60,Nice,Good products,3
61,Nice,Was ok for the the price... Gives you a cool look but don't expect with the health sensor motion and all ...,3

66,Fair,Call alert function not working,3
67,Decent product,"Stylish and gud looking but feature wise not good.
Oxymeter- Bakwas
Bp- ekdum fake
Heart rate- okay
Activity sensors are of no use I'm posting it after a month of purchase. If you want to show off then only go for it.",3
68,Nice,Nice,3
69,Fair,Good value for money. Has no issues except the blood pressure sensor. It's highly inaccurate. So if u want to test ur blood pressure then don't buy it. Otherwise no issue. Also to UI is quiet laggy but it is acceptable for the price. Also several improvement is required in the app,3
70,Decent product,Good product.Battery back up is awesome and thanx for fast delivery,3

75,Fair,"Average product
Tracking is not accurate.
Battery backup is good.
Looking good.
Screen glass is very poor.",3
76,Just okay,Watch is good. But boat gear app is lagging. Synchronizing time watch gets restart and all activity gets erased. So nothing on record. It's better to use only watch without using app. Hope software updates solves this bug,3
77,Nice,Not bad okay but please add to new futures,3

86,Decent product,watch is awesome but did not fulfilled its promise of 100 faces. Still waiting for the update,3
87,Good,"Very poor packing. Flipkart should improve such type of unprofessionalism. I got the order today with very poor packing condition.

Look is good, and for this price range you can’t expect more. Graphics and notifications are seems below average. App is working smoothly . Size and weight is perfect. Touch quality is okay for this price. Anyone who is looking for a budget smart watch; go for it.",3
88,Nice,Didn't except so low grade belt very harsh on skin. Don't have any call alert feature and very delayed notifications alert. Screen isn't so premium on touch feels cheap. Music control doesn't looks premium and sometime doesn't work. Doesn't worth for money.,3
89,Just okay,"Its just 2 weeks I have purchased this item & facing problem. While synchronizing by Boat pro gear app,after 87% synchronizing, the watch restarts automatically. Can anyone help me with this issue?
Rest of the things are ok.",3
90,Does the job,Just for show nothing other than SpO2 is accurate..Can't pick the call.only call Disconnect option.It was more of a show watch or call it a healthband no real smartwatch,3

Screen resistance is so bad. It scratch whenever touched some where",3
98,Does the job,"If you want to use it for activity tracking then please don't buy, it always gives wrong data and you can't use it for swimming. The pathetic one is the notification it always gives notification after I read out from my mobile and that too with the irritating vibration.",3

125,Does the job,"After using for 1 week, i give 3.5 stars to it. Here are my reviews:
1. As mentioned in other reviews regarding sync issue, i never found this issue. I even synced 10 times in a single day.
2. Call disconnecting/pick up option is not available through app. But in this cheap price range of 2000/- this feature might not be expected.
3. Individual Notification can not be handled. You can only remove all notifications that too in one go.
4. Battery back up is fine.. I usually charge after 4-5
Days. Full charging takes 2 hours.
5. Activity tracking is good (Do not know how to check accuracy)
6. Lift wrist Screen sense feature (light turns on featurewhen you lift the wrist to check time) does not work properly sometimes.",3

If the display was in off it's looks bad, the screen position can be easily identified
Also provide update with both wrist rise and tap to wake ,
More good watch faces
Watch wakes up after a second of wrist rise also for notifications
Every time we should download cloud watch faces this is a good disadvantage
The brightness levels are too poor ,provided with only 3 levels
If there was a mute option during receiving calls it would be better
The battery backup is good as expected it will lasts upto 6-10 days based on usage
Activity tracking is also nice and tracks the result approximately accurate

Overall the watch is good at this price range",3

1. Watch has a basic design with sturdy looking material. Glass provided on watch is easily scratched so be careful while using. Strap is good but not best also alternative strap is not provided in package.
2. Now the OS .... It's a simple looking and operated within 4 swaps up down right left OS nothing complicated in it. You can easily find all the utilities. There is 4 faces given in watch you can add from cloud or from your phone photos.
3. Sensor provided are good but not 1st class... Your o2 reading is always fluctuate and all the time it's either 95 or 99. Heart beat sensor is more accurate tallied with BP monitor. BP measurement is also near the accurate. Step tracker is good
4. App provided by boat in phone is not that great there is some issues like you have to sync it every time. Also heart rate display in app is not seen unless you take a live reading in watch. There is login issue also you have to login every single day in that app.

Over all its worth the money you spend but not that great",3

1. Display 2. Touch 3. Battery 4. Spo2/BP/Heart rate sensors

Can Improve:
1. The settings are lost every now and then, sync with device is problematic. Restarts watch several times.
2. Cycling activity counts calories, even if i m sitting in a chair.
3. Should have added at least Badminton activity apart from the 8 modes.

The display size is very small. Thats disheartening.
And BP meter and oxymeter show wrong values almost everytime . If the apps don't work properly,, the company should look into it and upgrade it or sthng .. but the company did nothing..
Otherwise the watch is just fine. But then it doesn't make up the amount paid for this watch if the sensors are not proper.",3

Unsatisfactory service response ,
no genuine accessories available in online/ offline market , online market as well as boat website . Now what should I do with discharged watch. Pathetic . No one is there to resolve issue at service call centre .

Before purchasing be assured whether cable is available after market or not , because once mistaken your money goes.",3
731,Nice,Good watch to purchase.,3
732,Just okay,"Good one
Only cons are:
Battery
Activity tracking some some times issue
Pairing issue also",3
733,Fair,"A budget smart watch in all sense. Limited features and some of the features are not very accurate, instead those features like SpO2/BP monitor could have been avoided. Even though there are watch faces available on cloud, watch can hold only 6 watch faces at a time, 4 which comes by default, 1 customized (like a custom picture) and one cloud face, to change the cloud face it needs to be downloaded and synchronized from the app and the new face will replace the old one on the watch. Many functions has to be done on the app and not on watch, for instance if a new alarm has to be set it needs to be added from the app. So most of the features are app driven and cannot be done from the watch.",3

i am facing some problems in this watch. if you want notification of call and app then pro gear app should be always open in your smartphone. and the second problem is when i am going to sync my watch with pro gear app it's say sync failed and my watch restart .
sensor also not working aqurate. if you check your blood pressure continue 5 times, it's result different.

The functionality is amazing and display quality is also good, the battery life is not so good compare to other smart watches this is the main drawback, the battery life comes for 5-6 days for 1 full charge. Belt quality good and smooth. ❤️ Rate sensor gives nearly accurate BPM and other good thing is oxygen sensor is good but I don't know how much accurate this, BP monitoring also there quite a good feature, music control is good.

I don't believe in any reviews untill I use it any gadgets.
You can consider accuracy level in btw 85 to 95 perc.

My positive Result of Day 1 uses.

BLOOD PRESSURE. NORMAL

DIAL INTERFACE. EVERY TIME YOU NEED TO EITHER DOWNLOAD A PHOTO OR SELECT FROM YOUR OWN PHONE GALLARY .

MUSIC CONTROL CONTROL YOUR DEFAULT MUSIC PLAYER, VOL UP AND DOWN . AND PAUSE AND PLAY.

Incorrect accuracy in waking activitie - automatically update walking.

Other Sports activities , I have not gone through. And different modes as per you task every day , select and do it.

You can set Your alarm, call reminder in your watch.",4

Oxygen level and heart rate is almost accurate.

Step count, calorie count etc also accurate.

Only concern is Boat Pro Gear app, it doesn't work well as of now. Problems in changing watch faces. So it need to be updated asap.

Overall of you are looking for a budget smart watch you can go for it.",4

Heart beat measurements are accurate or not I'm not sure about is steps and other calorie function are normal like other smart watch and battery capacity is depends on usage specified by the product 🙂",4
1233,Value-for-money,"Watch Is Very Good And The Best In This Price Range - 2500 Rs .. But The App is Very Bad And Updates Are Worst ..

If You Are Looking For The Best Watch Under 3500 Rs Or 3000rs Definitely Buy This Watch .. And Another Alternate is Zebronics Smart Watch Which Costs Around 2300 Rs",4
1234,Wonderful,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.

1236,Value-for-money,"Good one with best price, but the BP monitor is not that much accurate, SPO2 nd HRt is accurate compared with medical divice.",4
1237,Value-for-money,"I received watch on 28 April.
Watch came with charger, warranty card,boat sticker.
It was well packed,in good condition.
Look wise it's looks good.
Display is good n clear even under sunlight.
Belt won't very very best quality but it's very decent n acceptable one light weight we can change if needed.
Watch tracks steps with difference of +- 10 steps when crosschecked manually counting n with my old lenovo hw01 band.
Spo2 it reads with very well being a surgeon I checked with our standard O2 monitor which showed almost correct value with sometime difference of +-2 percent which is definitely acceptable.
Heart rate checks correctly again cross checked with our heart rate monitor .
Blood pressure can't comment how it checks
It gives value around my actual blood pressure but
I will go for actual spygmomanometer.
It displays incoming call n notification if bluetooth is on n location is on all time when used with app.
All 4 stars for watch
Now
App
Which is where problem starts
Sync it with watch all time
App will consider your
previous or 1st activity of a day as base activity n every time watch get sync with app it will adjust your steps to previous activity n decreases the number of steps.
If your goal is 15000
Watch n app will set goal to 8000steps . n steps decreased accordingly then same thing repeats when next sync happens

After using for 8 days got a solution for it
Sync the watch only once in night before sleep n app retains that activity properly
But side effects of which is you have to avoid syncing watch whole day so can't check app for activity but can see watch for activity .
You won't get notifications because watch is not connected whole time with mobile app
Watch is fantastic but app is a crapp.
Hope boat gets it app updated well to avoid PPL not buying watch bec of app
I gave 4* coz watch is awesome n I don't need full time notification .

We can change face of watch from face downloaded in app
Or our gallery pic.

Battery on 8th day of continious use still 36% remaining so for me good battery .
May be less if app is sync all time.
Cost is cheap compared to other watches with similar features.
With good accuracy in steps spo2 heart rate
Display. Multiple sports mode it's good buy with a hope boat
Improves there app too",4
1238,Nice product,The product is very good. Value for money. Only issue is there is no feature of sleep monitor.The product description says we can monitor the sleep and the corresponding app also has the seperate column to sleep monitor reading but the the watch doesn't track the sleep activities and no data is shown for sleep. Other than that all features are very good and percentage of error is negligible. So for 2.5K you can buy. Compared to boat smart watch and noise pro 2 smart watch(3K) both are same size but noise smart watch doesn't have spo2 feature and blood pressure feature. These 2 features are extra add ons in boat with cheaper price.,4

1262,Pretty good,"After using 3 months i m writing this review
Cons:

It is a good product by Boat. Some big issues are also there. My watch going restart again and again when i open their App. Because when it start to synchronize the watch is switching off and then on automatically. I think it is the main issue that must be solve. Another issue is i noticed that whenever this watch arriving in sale after that boat is giving you new clock styles which is still low in amount so why boat not giving or updating new style after certain time. SpO2 sensor is not giving proper reading though, so please keep in mind that don't think this results are actual or don't take results in real time. If you have doubt about oxygen level please go to nearby clinic and go through treatment. Stay safe.",4

- if we disconnect Bluetooth it will not connect automatically. It should be though. (u have to go manually)

- music control is ultra slow it react 2 sec later after touch. (irritating)
These r the only issue I faced personally till 3 days of use and still I have 55 percent of battery... So Battery backup is about 6 days in medium use. May be it go 7 to 8 if we do not connect it with phone. Still batteries r good. Cause it takes only 2 hrs to charge so no issue.",4

Battery backup is more than decent, since the unboxing it went good for 5 straight days with 88% charge. BP and SPo2 tracking is good and trust worthy. The watch looks really great when screen is off, however variety of watch faces is limited. Boat should upgrade the cloud watch face options. Overall, at this price point, a definite winner.",4

Pros

- Good battery back up. With full charge it can last upto 6-7 days, even with continuous heartbeat check.

- Good activity tracking, most cases it's accurate and have mostly used options.

- Have option of SPO2 and BP monitoring. Though the BP monitoring is something can't be considered accurate most of the time

Cons

- Below average app for tacking
- Lack of good watchface, there is no update in watchface section.
- Sync issue sometimes

2428,Value-for-money,"I got this for 2000. It's better than xlporer because the only new thing given there is GPS anf extra 1000 or 500(usual price) for it and there is no notification of social media on it. The watch is the most popular and best one in this price range. The body is classy and the belt is very nice and non sticky. You get different colour too. The display is okay in this range. The sensor are correct to large extent. I checked the BP and SpO2 in the machines and there is only slight difference in it, so it's very helpful in quick times. In this price the sensors and their functions are to the mark. The strap is very good material and looks shiny. The dial is variable and you can change to your own wallpaper. The functions are very nice in this. Tracking is somewhat correct almost. The vibration is nice. The features are very advanced in this price. You get music control too so that's great really. The screen touch is good and not very sensitive. The relax mode is a good feature here. The app pro gear needs to fix some bugs, and the connectivity issues should be fixed by the app or else everything is good. I have used it for more than 10 days now and the batter is still there. So it depends on your usage. Battery is okay as you can easily use. The brightness level decrease will save much of your battery. It looks good and is handy too.
