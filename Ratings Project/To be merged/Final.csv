0,Absolute rubbish!,"Really very bad. I went for cheapest mobile with 4k RAM and now experiencing issues with cheap products. Neither it has C type USB, nor performance. Quality of front camera is really bad. I hangs and I doubt if it really has 4GB RAM. It doesn't have much volume. Overall, I'm very much dissatisfied if I compare it with my last purchase of Redmi 8A. I have to bear this phone for at least 1 year.
It is like Cheating by Flipkart in the name of cheapest phone with 4GB RAM in addition to cheating by Xiaomi.",1

1911,Absolute rubbish!,"This is an average earphone that does the job it is meant to do. However I'm an audiophile (I work in AIR). So I am used to listening to Seinnehier, jbl or Sony audio. The brand is boult which sounds eerily like boat of USA. There the similarity ends. Boat earphones are far superior, the bass is perfect even for very low frequency sounds and treble balance is calibrated in a way that does not pain your ears even at full volume.
Please note: If the audio quality is stereo or multi track recording, then this earphone will work fine. The problem arises if the audio quality is not up to the mark. Then this boult headphone is found wanting.
Edited after 15 days of mild use:
The earphone's one ear went dead and the volume on the other ear reduced drastically rendering it useless. I cannot return/replace it or repair it. So Rs. 350 plus gone down the drain. Reducing the star rating.",1

Design is good and but didn't impressed by Sound Quality. Sound quality is average , I was expecting a good sound but didn't get it in this product.
Got it for 349 but I guess any local product can do bettr experience instead of this even in less price.",3
5,Good,"for this price range it's best product.great . got it for RS 349 . good sound quality and more bass. nice design.
cons : I am not sure about build quality I hope it lasts long. and not tangle free.",3
6,Fair,"Quality of music not good
specially back round music not a clear
minute rhythems also not clear
Normal head set like a feature phone",3
7,Does the job,The headphone is decent. Its sound quality is very good but wire quality is very bad. Nowadays Boult should give us braided cable for their headphones. Then it will be better to the daily tough users. Other wise not bad. More improvement needed Boult Audio. Thanks.,3
8,Good,"sound quality is moderate but bass is not good as Boat Superbase Headphones 220... plug is like low quality... noise cancellation is very bad... mic is very big , it's not small... Bass is very low in quality... it's looking very good but not good as it looks",3
9,Fair,"Good for hearing movies or ongoing conference call , video call but bass is not enough for hearing good music.build quality good. Metal finish headphones, but the price I bought it gives satisfaction.rs 340+40 carrying cost total 380..at that price it's worth it.",3
10,Nice,Sound is good but bass is not too good in listening but overall it is great product in such low cost.,3
11,Nice,"Not satisfied with the performance of the product. Products cheaper than this offer much better sound experience.
One can hear basis sound only. Not able to experience Richness of music.
My money wasted.",3
12,Nice,"A preety budget headphone with decent sound quality although the clarity is excellent. The earbuds are prone to slip away from ear although my ear shape couple have contributed to it. Overall, a good earphone within a low budget, satisfied!",3
13,Just okay,"Red color looks quite funky.
Sound quality is above average,
Vocal (treble) is very clear and loud,
But BASS is quite less, you wont feel any bass unless a song is full bass beats. Still you'll have to fiddle with equalizer to extract some bass.
Comes with extra ear buds.
I expected the build quality of wire to be braided, and durable which is not the case. The wire is fragile like ordinary lower priced earphones.
So, overall, buy it for looks and loud volume but dont expect strong bass or durability.",3
14,Nice,design is boring and using this for few minutes I start to feel pain in my ears cuz the ear buds are to big and i thought that the design will be more stylish but it's not good looking to show others....not so nice product thank you..,3
15,Just okay,"the sound quality is good
the audio part is overall very nice...the product design is cool but it isnt as heavy as expected ..it has light weight heads....also volume buttons are not available .
I liked the product..its affordable,looks cool and has a good audio.",3
16,Just okay,"These sounds good but when you put them in the ears not playing any songs,feels like Ur holding Ur ears much tighter can't hear anything, though they provide various buds which are small, medium,bigger buds so u can wear small buds for the comfort at least",3
17,Fair,"1. decent sound

19,Does the job,"Fair audio quality, average bass, good for phone calls rather than listening to music.. Design is very stylish and comfortable in ears..",3
20,Fair,"sound is not so sharp....if you expect a clear lyrics then you may get disappointed...buildwise it's good...u can use it for long time without any problem..bass is average...all in all if you a die heart music lover this thing is not for you...but if you expect a pretty descent sound, mic for recieving call at a reasonable price then you surely consider this as an option.",3

22,Good,it's good compared to other headsets like boat ...I bought this product based on the reviews....after I bought I go through all the sound tests ....I liked it,3

24,Fair,after using six months.its not working,3
25,Decent product,sounds good decent bass but built quality is poor,3
26,Just okay,"This Headset comes up with beautiful sound clarity with moderate Bass, if you use it carefully it will work for 2yrs .. But for me it lasted only for 6 months as I am a rough user so it got damaged at one side without any external damage to it. Overall it's an good product at that price range.",3

34,Dont buy Boult headphones,"First time in so many years i felt cheated by Flipkart. This Boult is a complete waste of money. My headphones stopped working in exactly 20 days and shockingly even after registering a online complaint, i was asked to courier the faulty one to their Delhi warehouse. I spent 200 rs and sent the same from BBY to Delhi. Waited for 10-12 days and after a numerous followups, got the piece which looked like an extensively used one. Unfortunately that headphones also had issues with the mic but even after complaining to them, its now more than 10 days and no response from them . I think we should avoid these fly by night guys like BOULT, XMATE etc completely. utter waste of m oney.",3

36,Just okay,Only because of delivery I have rated 3 star. Otherwise the good is awesome,3
37,Go for Mi Basic Wired Headset,"I have used this earphones for 4 days straight after getting delivered. I observed slight pain in my right ear due to the way it is made. This was the reason i returned this earphone.
Also, there is nothing special about this earphone.
Build: 2.5/5 (It's build didn't seem that tough),
Bass: 4/5 (seems like bass is not natural),
Clearness in sound: 3/5 (extra or over of bass spoils the sound),
Length of wire: smaller as compared to other earphones,
Quality: 3/5 (doesn't seem premium)

I finally ordered back my last earphones which are costing the same price as of these boult earphones -> MI basic wired headset. I would suggest buy ''mi basic wired headset'' instead of going for these. Those earphones are literally much more than of the price they are. Thank you Mi.",3

sound experience of it is same as boat.

philips have basic one.

build quality is best in this. boat have moderate while mi have least. mi work well for 6 months only after that it got issues.

its water proof so enjoy along with your bath if you are a boothroon singer.

don't get fooled by their promotion.
microwoofer, 10nm driver, bass booster etc.
simply nothing in it.

if you have tight budget go for it.

if you want best build quality and perfectly balanced earphones then go for house of marley smile jamaica em je 041sb.

if you just want to enjoy music then Sennheiser cx 180/213 .",3

830,Just okay,"This review is for older version with straight jack pin (not the angled pin current version) Awesome quality @400inr is just unbelievable.. sound quality is great.. I used JBL and other best brands.. this is on par with all those brands. Bass is decent and in right balance. It's not too thumpy bass.. but it's not fitting into the ears firmly, even small shake or touch of the wire it comes out of ear.. may be I need to use proper earcap size which is provided. overall good. But after six months one side of the earphone stopped working. I sent it for replacement. But i received same defective product without servicing .. after that I again sent back. And I received new replacement product i.e. current version of angled jack.
Coming to the new replaced product i.e. current version of angled jack model. I would say it's not like original version(straight jack). Original version sound quality, build quality, material and look and feel was premium and everything was perfect. But this new version is plasticky, all are cheap quality and not very good looking . Sound quality of new version also not good. Overall current version angled jack model is worthless.. totally I lost my money",3

1443,Worth the money,"I actually bought these lil buds in July in last year. These are just amazing the design, sound, style. Bass is lil low, cost is affordable, quality is good. Actually my friend has bet with me, he said that these earphones are waste and those will not work after 1 month. Then I said these will work more than 3 months. And this is the Sixth month since I've bought. So go for it...",4

and. i bet you guys if you are low to high sort lover(looking for good earphone at less price) then you definitely love this product.
.....
....
attached a photo for longevity of this product",4
1446,Value-for-money,"These earphones are a true value for money products. They are the best that you can get in this price range. I bought them for Rs.375. The only this that seems not up to the mark is the packaging of this product. Except for this everything about the earphones is great. Following the best qualities that I got to know for using them for about 3 weeks-
1) They have a perfect fit, in almost all kinds of ears.
2) Minimalistic looks.
3) They have a well-balanced sound output and that extra bass giving a nice little thump in every drop.",4
1447,Very Good,Really it was good i had compare with boat basshead 100 . Both are same in Soud quality But material wise boult is better,4
1448,Value-for-money,"Good at the price range, sound is loud and clear with good mic capacity. Built quality is also good parts like buds, mic and jack's above part are metallic. Wire also tangle free. Overall good for normal user.",4
1449,Pretty good,"Very good product with noise cancellation in this amount is worth appreciable. And not an inch bad when compared to products like MI, Boat headphones in this range. Went perfectly for 8 months but then it became like any other Chinese earphone, I mean one earpiece working but the other isn't. Go for this in this budget.",4
1450,Nice product,"So I have used this for entire day, For PubG, Video Streaming and Listening Songs. Let me get this straight.
1. Very good vocals.
2. Loud and Clear Sound - Deadly Combination
3. Bass - Not Satisfactory.

So if u want to use this for PubG or normal usage than is is extremely good but if you are a bass lover than don't go for it.
4.4 rating for bass is misdirection. Its a nice earphone at the price but I cannot feel bass as same as mi basic or my Boult curve neckband.
I will update about calls later.",4
1451,Value-for-money,"The audio clarity is impressive , awesome bass , but the built have to be stronger for greater endurance",4
1452,Worth the money,"Boult headphones, I and my family have been using since 2019. We used number of its headphones because of good sounds quality, easy to use, sound proof, quality of material used was good. But this time or from Late December 2020 Boult headphones reduced or depreciated quality of its product or material such as Ear Buds quality is so pathetic(Due to it, earphones not stayed in ear and it mostly fall or slip) and no sound proof this time. So, here I want to request you that please don't alleviate the trust which have built on this product but still you are providing good sounds quality but also please maintain the quality of material. That's all from my side and hope you will act on it.",4
1453,Very Good,"I used this Boult earphone for sometime .When I got this earphone for the first-time it has amazing bass and sound. But after almost 5 months of use it's sound slowly fades on one side. Then I got the replacement for it and then it repeats the same after 5 months of usage.
So any one needs a great sound quality with affordable price earphone for 5 months time .It's the best earphone at this price.
But if you need some durability and also equally good quality sound then go for MI basic earphone. why I suggest MI basic model earphone is because I got both the earphones at the same time but MI still the best after 1year at the same time period I already used two Boult audio earphones(Best sound quality but not durable).",4
1454,Really Nice,"Look earphone is too good . I am using it personally i don't have any problem .
Bass is good , Sound quality is good . But ap per the cost .
The thing is that when i saw a Mi earphone with thee same price. I was shocked , That the sound quality is far better than This earphone.
so i recommend to go with Mi earphone with in this price .",4
1455,Wonderful,"Sound :If you are comparing it to the likes of realme buds2,jbl c150si or senheiser cx 180 in terms of sound quality.It produces a bit scratchy sound(you may not notice if you are not an audiophile).enough bass but not very pleasing,now coming to treble it is very good.you will enjoy playing pubg,cod on this.i know many already use bluetooth ones but they need budget wired headset for gaming.

Comfort: earbud part is light and comfortable for most people.

Build quality: It is good according to price except earbud part feels cheap plastic.
Conclusion: pretty average for music lovers but good for gaming.
Go for it if you get at 299(max:350) else go for realme buds2
(If need mic and sturdy build)or senheiser cx180 if you can compromise on durability and mic.",4
1456,Good quality product,"I haven't used any wired earphones before.It has the best bass, I'm using this from one month , after a month i can say that it has the best bass in this price range and even it has the best build quality, nd nice design too.Its working on both the sides not like offline store quality. it is best buying instead of buying a smuggled or cheap item for 100 rs in the offline shops.",4
1457,Wonderful,"Awesome really good sound , base perfect micro buffer mic is also perfect I bought again today it's really fantastic sound quality but warranty card scan QR code not work and customer care no also not contact so don't buy it to see for one year warranty today 14/09/20 I am really very disappointed with this baout earphone and it's survise today my left spikar not working and nor getting survishes by company nither by Flipkart so plz don't buy this",4

1470,Very Good,"I am writing this review approximately one year usage of this earphone. Honestly saying one of the best earphone in this range (i buyed it in 350 INR). Only one earphone I found is same is MI BASIC of 400 INR you can go anyone of these two both are similar little bit higher bass in mi. But u will find it similar. Overall built quality is good wire is of rubber not a thread or plastic, earphone have metallic finish .",4
1471,Really Nice,"I like to listen songs with Bass,by seeing some reviews some of them written this earphones for Bass lover this totally wrong its just good earphone with good sound clarity .

boat earphones fitting is very good in ears.",4
1476,Delightful,"Build quality not up to the mark above average ,sound quality is decent ,bass is good at this price point overall the product worth my money..",4
1477,Wonderful,Better than any other options available offcourse better than boat's headphones. At 300 u can't get anything better than this,4
1478,Really Nice,"The bass isn't enough , though the sound is good . But adding a extra thump can be preferred , the built quality is not the best ......but it is ok somehow !",4
1479,Pretty good,"I have listed to few good headphones such as JBL,bose, Sennheiser etc. I have one Sennheiser CX 213, and now I got this one. So comparing to all this I can say with this price it's good. My CX 213 has much more smoother audio and treble, with a good bass...but I feel as this Boult has this micro woofer so it's bass is little on higher side compared to others but if you have any Equalizer then you can control it accordingly. overall it's good.",4
1480,Wonderful,"Good product at this price.
Below 400 it's worthy
Better than any other costly earphones like JBL and also realme. You can but it and enjoy better sound quality...",4

1490,Good quality product,"Awsome voice clarity, bass is superb same like boAt BassHeads 220.
Wire is thin as compared to boAt Bassheads 220.
Wire is not tanglefree...
@349 this is the best earphones i have ever used..
Delivery experience is too bad for me it takes 16days to delivered the product as i am also a Flipkart plus member..:-(",4
1491,Good quality product,It's a good item and the bass is awesome but if you see headset use while on bed so at that place it is not comfortable because as you turn your body to any side it penetrate ear due to its length.,4
1492,Value-for-money,sound and bass quality is perfect just like jbl. now lets see is it durable or not.,4
1493,Pretty good,"Looks decent and a very good bass line.
But I didn't like the way how the trigger has been designed. It's a little closer to the earpiece, which is annoying.
When connected in certain ways to your phone, the sound echoes out. I'm not sure if it is an issue with my phone or this headset, but no other headset has given me such an issue.
Though not a prominent issue, other than that, everything is looking great.",4
1494,Wonderful,Awesome product to purchase under 500.. but it wouldn't fix for Moto like some other mobiles.. needs to improve that part side fault.. rest of all perfect apart the not suitable for the all the mobiles,4
1495,Good choice,initially I had a small problem since the right earpiece stopped working. contacted support services shipped my product and got it fixed. I would recommend you buy these instead of jbl and other highly priced brands because their sound quality is only slightly better than these. cool earphones snugly fitting in the ear. perfect.,4
1496,Very Good,"it's a good earphone.
the comfort is not that good but not very bad.
for the price the quality is okay.",4
1497,Nice product,good product.. bass and sound quality is good. great value product. I can recommend this product.its better than boat BassHeads 100 wired,4
1498,Worth the money,"build quality is rather good for this price range , and even for long hours the buds are quite comfortable . best for the price offered",4
1499,Delightful,Design is ok and the build looks kinda cheep though it works better than its design . Putting everything together the sound is awesome and truely a value for money product to buy. Happy with the product as I am using it a bit rough for almost one month now and in contrast to its weak build its providing resilience . All together you can go for it.,4
1500,Good choice,it's sound is really good. but it's not supporting my one plus mobile. call pick up button is not working in that phone. but it's working in other phone like Honor 9 lite. base is awesome. built quility is good.,4
1501,Wonderful,"headset looks good, sounds quality is best and it's bass are too best but it's pin or jack which we should have to attached with any device is so tight and not easy way to remove. so my suggestion is too please put grip on jack and do something which will help to easy to remove from device.",4
1502,Very Good,"Good earbuds with an excellent price.
Pros
1. Clear Sound with decent bass
2. Excellent Pricing
Cons
1. Cable not Not tangle free
2. Sound reception is a bit low on clarity at receivers end",4
1503,Worth the money,very smooth sounds good bass comfortable for ears...but not like JBL,4
1504,Good quality product,"Great earphones for the price. Nice built quality and sound. Bass is not that great as expected. Had to turn up the bass level. Overall, great deal.",4

Flipkart Delivery service is also Good and on time.",4
1506,Good quality product,Earphone qwality is good bass is good but ear grip is little disappoint go fo it but MI earphone is very good that mrp 699 bass is very very good of MI earphone than Boult MI Has music control switches but Boult has not as per price comparison 300 difference I prefer MI if you have not control button required so you are go for it but ihaveto prefer MI earphone,4
1507,Pretty good,"Thanks to Flipkart for delivering this in just 2 days. Coming to the headset, it is just awesome for the price. Excellent bass, great sound & good build quality. Using it, loving it and hope that it will deliver same for the future!

Excellent job Boult.",4
1508,Value-for-money,"I am not very good at identifying the bass etc. i switched to this from a normal earphone which comes in the box with phones and it was pretty good. Like a different experience all together. I haven't used any high end earphones either so my review is limited to the budget buyers. its a nice fit. gives nice sound.
if u were using common earphones and plan to switch to something more good and ur budget is below 500, i would definitely recommend this.",4
1509,Value-for-money,"Previously I had Philips earphones. Now, I have bought this earphones. after using it after a week this was my opinion...

this earphones are worth buying...

Note:- The audio on YouTube is not that much high. which you can experience in your Normal audio players in your smartphones. it has excellent Bass. Mic quality is also good. Only thing is Build quality. But, again cable is superb. You can carry easily....",4
1510,Good choice,"The bass is high and superb but the clarity and vocals take a toll its good but not great.
Overall Great for price I didn't find a better one at this price",4
1511,Worth the money,Decent wired headset with good bass and equally good treble. mic clarity is a little low. Good for music.,4
1512,Very Good,"Really a nice piece... after trying earphones from THE FAMOUS flipkart smart buy earphone and Boat product in the approximately similar price range( a lill costlier than this), I would declare this as a clear winner.. For some limitations, I feel the design does not look very great for me and you might have a hard time in adjusting the buds in your ear. But when it comes to sound quality, clarity and the bass, it stands tall..
So if you are looking something under 500 rs., I would say, this should be your pick!!",4
1513,Pretty good,The sound clarity and volume is amazing but the bass must be configured a bit more..treble is fine..switching thru different equaliser modes should be noticed very distinctively..at this point it’s a good deal,4
1514,Very Good,"The earphone is quite great for this price. I bought it for 350 and for that price the build quality is amazing. This headset also features a great sound quality i.e. the treble sound is good but the bass is not that good unless you push the earphone deeper in your ear which also is uncomfortable. Overall, the earphone is spectacular for the given price. However if you could increase your budget a little more I would suggest you to buy JBL earphones which have extremely good sound quality and bass. I hope this helps : )",4
1515,Good choice,"Nice HD sound quality..... and bass is more than average and best in this range
Must buy product for music lover",4

1518,Nice product,yes the product is nice and personally I like this ear phone in which sound quality is good and colour is also fency which looks funky actually so i will strongly recommend for the purchase of this ear phone in the price range under 400 i like it.,4

1535,Pretty good,"The product looks just like the image on the app. The comfort in the ear, the sound quality and clarity is awesome. The bass feature helps to focus on what I am listening to and the sounds around me get omitted. So, good job! There is no travel case I got with it as written in the description. However, the product was well packed and I received it by the stipulated time. Thank you seller and Flipkart!",4

1557,Wonderful,"I guess there's no warranty as no warranty card was given like with other Boult Audio products.

Have been using them for an year now. Sound is awesome but the mic doesn't work properly. The other person can't hear, mic has to be kept really close to mouth.",4
1558,Really Nice. Good Quality. Premium product,"As compared to price and sound quality it is very good. wire and built in quality is very nice and looks like premium product.
Base is heavy.. good for DJ lovers.",4
1559,Pretty good,The product was delivered earlier than expected. The earphones are great considering the price range. The bass is good enough and the best I have had in this price range but the treble is very weak. It is most likely not enough for any long gaming sessions. It is good enough for casual gaming and movies though. The ear starts paining a little after extended period of use but I think that will be the case only for the initial few days,4
1560,Good choice,The ear phones are good but i felt that bass was not so great its ok ok and overall sound quality is good but at this price this package is awesome. So just buy it.,4

1563,Good choice,"In terms of sounds, the product is on the mark, I use 'Boult Loop' as well, bang on money for bass, but in terms of product quality, very fragile. Wire's quality too clumsy, can break easily, so does the plastic used. Feels cheap, better to go for 'Boult Loop' adding some more bucks",4

1618,Good choice,"As compared to price, no doubt its too good. Lower frequencies are too effective, mid range is also ok. There is lack of response of high frequency ranges. A little muffing was found loosing the clarity of each frequency.
As per design, its noticable, lightweight and sturdy.
Good choice for bass lovers at low price.",4

All three died slowly, first the left earbud went bad and then the right one. It happened with all the three headphones and almost after similar no of days. The soldering of wires at the 3.5mm jack is the main culprit and it gives away after 4-6 months of use. If they can just fix that problem, we already have winner on hands.",4

----------------------------
Design, looks, and performance are good.
Motor performance is good even though it's 500W.

Bad's
---------------------------
The jars are extremely thin and delicate. A small pressure by hand can cause dents.
The packaging was extremely poor and substandard, shocked to see such cheap packaging from a brand like Butterfly.
The blades seem to be extremely thin and blunt. No sharpness at all.
Jars are very small in size, unlike other standard mixer grinders.",3
